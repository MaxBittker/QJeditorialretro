By making their events inclusive and encouraging all students and staff to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, the week will help increase solidarity across the University and as Anna Fischer, Outwrite! chair, said, “it will increase the visibility of queer students on campus, and help to foster a safer, more accepting environment.””"

Although most of the mainstream population is tolerant, you have to, as a visible minority, expect some degree of abuse from a small pocket of the majority population.This should not happen but it does happen.”"

Shaping this debate are the numerous decisions people have made as to what’s worth reporting about race and what isn’t—in short, what makes race “news.”” "

It shouldn’t take a poster, or friends cringing. That makes it a political correctness issue when it should be a human issue.”"

The piece focuses on concerns within the academic community about the implications of a university gaining—as one student put it—a “reputation of being Asian.””“Ultimately, an individual is free to discount attending a university based on whatever criteria are most important to him or her. If this includes concerns about a university’s “Asian” reputation, then that student is simply letting their own racism inform a highly consequential decision.And he or she should probably think twice.” "
http://www.queensjournal.ca//story/2010-10-05/editorials/man-moan-less/,"“The idea that being a man “has to” mean certain things is short-sighted and offensive, and does nothing but contribute to gender stereotypes.

When shaping the new position, ASUS would do well to carefully consider what they want out of the role.At the same time, a broad domain like equity, which includes questions like diversity, gender and ability, should be considered a portfolio under everyone’s belt worthy of individual effort and attention.It’s unfortunate the creation of an Equity Commissioner role has ended up sparking more conflict for ASUS instead of promoting the positive change that was intended. It seems ASUS is left with more work to do where equity is concerned.”"
