Others reserve the right to cover theirs. ,In any event, it’s the existence of choice that’s essential. ,For instance, some women may choose not to cram their feet into four-inch heels for an eight-hour shift waiting tables. ,Some women may not want to wear an outfit that exposes them to sexual harassment at their workplace. ,Other women may not want to spend more money than they make in one shift on a required Lululemon skirt, jewelry, heels, makeup and hair products just to meet the required level of sex appeal. ,Yet, these are requirements at many restaurants.,At the core of these dress codes is the assumption that an employer has the right to exploit a woman’s body for its sex appeal, if it adds to the business’ well-being. ,When an employer disproportionately takes advantage of one gender and their sexuality, they’re potentially violating their employees’ human rights. ,We have laws against gender discrimination for a reason: to protect workers from employers who take advantage of them or don’t care if they’re in uncomfortable or threatening situations.,Those without a real understanding of how it feels to be told to wear a miniskirt the size of a handkerchief often ask: if women don’t like those dress codes why don’t they just go work somewhere else? ,But this issue is far more widespread that we often realize — partially because even though gender discrimination in the workplace violates the Ontario Human Rights Code, it’s up to the workers to file a complaint. ,Moreover, it may not occur to many workers that their rights are being violated. We generally accept revealing tops and short skirts as the status quo, in large part because it’s such a widespread practice. ,A CBC Marketplace investigation found that dozens of employees from Moxie’s, Earls, Jack Astor’s and Joey Restaurants said “they felt pressured to wear revealing outfits or risk losing shifts.”,For the 22 per cent of Canadians who say their first job was in the restaurant business, it’s not always an option to just find another job. ,So, the next time you see a restaurant full of scantily-clad female servers take a minute to ask yourself — how would you feel in their high-heeled shoes? ,And maybe don’t spend your money at a business where it’s standard practice to require a miniskirt to be worn when carrying a heavy tray. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Yes, I’m aware I’m Asian","url":"/story/2016-02-25/editorials/yes-im-aware-im-asian/","date":"February 26, 2016","content":"When I think of a racist, I picture someone throwing insults at a certain ethnicity.

Usually these conversations start with a one-liner like, “Oh look, a cute Asian.” ,For the most part, my friends and I use my Tinder account as a way to entertain ourselves.

This same apathy contributes to incidences of inadvertent racism. ,As well as discouraging conspicuous racism, we should pay closer attention to racism when it’s less obvious. ,Ignorance leads us to continue to make clumsy remarks that seem mundane and innocent, but are in reality carpeting a subtle form of social inequality. ,I’d rather not receive a compliment at all, than be told that I’m appreciated based off an inaccurate assumption about who I am.,Anna is The Journal’s Video Editor.

Basing morality on appearance would make abortion just about as immoral as open-heart surgery. ,So if this group wants to use deliberately provocative practices, they should be expected to pay for the consequences when people are provoked. ,However, regardless of the popularity of their stance, anti-abortion groups have a legal right to protest in Canada. And while it’s well within the university’s rights to charge them a security fee, as they do with all groups, the amount is questionable.,On the one hand, the large security fee could be justified. The group’s protest last year caused quite a ruckus, and a similar commotion this year would result in increased security costs. ,But on the other hand, the magnitude of the fee is entirely stopping the protest. And there’s something wrong about that. ,Any way you slice it, slapping a clearly unfeasible, and unexplained, fee on a student group is shady and implies an ulterior motive. ,It’s difficult to justify the drastic leap in cost from last year’s $225 fee to $17,500, which makes this look like a targeted use of the university’s power to shut down an unpopular protest, not a genuine desire to ensure student safety.,So, while there may not be an outright denial of the group’s right to protest, they’re getting in the way to an inordinate degree. ,Moreover, the university can’t have been unaware that this group has a tendency to paint themselves as martyrs for free speech — and  that by extension the administration would be painted as oppressors of student voices. ,Even a superficial look at past activist movements is enough to illustrate that what’s an unpopular opinion at the time shouldn’t necessarily dictate how we judge their protest tactics or treat their right to protest. ,It does no good for the University of Alberta to counter poor tactics with an even poorer excuse. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Journalist, not judge ","url":"/story/2016-03-03/editorials/journalist-not-judge/","date":"March 4, 2016","content":"When Erin Andrews was secretly filmed while undressing, she became the victim in the scenario. So why does the media treat her like a criminal? ,Erin Andrews, a sportscaster for ESPN, was filmed through a peephole in her hotel room by a stalker, Michael David Barrett, who then posted the footage online where it was viewed millions of times. ,Afterwards, ESPN asked Andrews to do an on-air interview to clear up rumours that it had been a publicity stunt. ,Sports blogs and tabloid magazines ran photos of her naked body on their pages. When the stalker tried to sell the video to TMZ, they refused, but didn’t report to the police that someone had tried to sell them naked footage of Erin Andrews. ,Collectively, these institutions ignored the trauma that Andrews underwent and failed to protect her from harm. ,Victims of sexual harassment and assault are often hounded by media outlets for a quote, especially when the case goes to court. Andrews went through this, as did the alleged survivors in the Jian Ghomeshi trial. When the media gets ahold of any high-profile harassment or assault case, victims must run a media obstacle course on the path to justice. ,This behaviour speaks to the larger problem of how survivors are treated in our society. Accusations of “asking for it” and general skepticism lead us to treat survivors of sexual assault differently than victims of other crimes. ,Take the Andrews case. Her attorney asked her if she’d ever been in a pornographic film, because that could be used against her. There shouldn’t be any connection between the two, and yet it’s just one example of how victims must prove their own innocence in court.,But the situation doesn’t end with a verdict. Whenever a sexual assault case is reported by the media, survivors must also prove their innocence to the entire world. ,As journalists, we’re neither the judge nor the jury — we’re here to report the truth, not decide it. We’re here to hold the world accountable, so make sure you’re holding the right person accountable for their actions. ,I’m just a student journalist, but I’ve accepted the responsibility of always reporting the truth, and with that comes the promise to minimize harm. ,Treating sexual assault survivors this way means that as journalists, we’re breaking that mandate. ,Bias and misinformation will from time to time creep into coverage. But, at the very least, it shouldn’t result in shaming victims for something that wasn’t their fault. ,Vishmayaa is one of The Journal’s Copy Editors.

That way, reputable schools won’t waste time on candidates who don’t have what it takes.,But the current standardized testing system may pose an undue burden on low-income students, giving privileged applicants an unfair advantage. ,Standardized tests have increasingly become a test that one can study for. Which means they’re tests you can pay to do well on. You can buy study materials, pay a tutor or take an expensive prep course.,Students who repeatedly practice for a test have a leg up, compared to someone whose second job denies them the luxury of writing multiple practice tests a day.,Moreover, low-income students often can’t take the test repeatedly to improve their score, as is often done by students with greater financial resources.,When it comes down to it, time and money are barriers to professional education that have nothing to do with aptitude. To end a cycle of privilege and open up professional degrees to underprivileged members of our society, these barriers need to be reduced.  ,We can’t expect graduate schools to stop testing for baseline knowledge. But they should at least put less weight on a test that’s fundamentally skewed to favour privileged applicants — especially considering the test’s inaccuracies.,These tests are administered by third-party companies that don’t necessarily have a vested interest in how well high-scoring individuals do in graduate school.,To being with, most standardized tests don’t test innate intelligence, which is nearly impossible to measure in this format.,In most cases these tests are outdated, and often fail to adequately reflect whether a candidate will do well in graduate school.,While the workload involved in studying for a test may prepare an applicant for the crushing workload of graduate school, a high score doesn’t necessarily indicate whether someone would be a good lawyer or doctor.,There are many applicants who are willing to sacrifice more, work harder, and yet their scores don’t reflect this commitment in comparison to those who are more privileged and are afforded advantages.,A solution to closing this gap is to give more emphasis to other elements of applications, from reference letters to a personal essay.,Getting a real picture of an applicant’s worth should be based on a more nuanced context than a number — especially one that can be bought.,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Classroom improvements well worth the investment","url":"/story/2016-03-03/editorials/classroom-improvements-well-worth-the-investment/","date":"March 4, 2016","content":"Let’s face it — some Queen’s classrooms are in desperate need of a touch-up, which makes Queen’s recent allocation of $3 million to repairing classrooms a very welcomed venture., ,A good learning environment is essential to the student experience.

But we must ask — why hasn’t it changed?,Eurocentric topics and perspectives have been taught almost exclusively at Queen’s since its inception.,Fighting against the current is a struggle. Professors of colour who come to Queen’s face an environment where they’re the odd one out and their voice is marginalized to one-off specialized courses.,In 2001, a black female professor left her teaching position due to alleged experiences of racism, along with five other faculty members.,This incident eventually led to the Henry Report, published in 2004, which looked into systemic racism at Queen’s. The Henry report found that 55.8 per cent of white professors believed the University supported diversity while 34.8 per cent of faculty of minority backgrounds thought the same.,Calling for greater diversity in faculty doesn’t mean white professors aren’t wonderful and valuable. It’s detrimental to learning, however, when white professors are the only ones in the classroom.,But first it’s important we acknowledge the necessity of diversity at a university beyond a social justice narrative.,A homogenous institutional identity is damaging to students. The world isn’t uniform, so we shouldn’t be learning about it from one perspective. Learning from professors from a range of backgrounds exposes students to a variety of discourses, without which our intellectual maturity would be, and is, stumped.,As long as we continue to accept having whitewashed faculty and content as the norm, Queen’s will continue to uphold a Eurocentric world view.,A prestigious education in Canada is often synonymous with a traditional, colonialist education — and this will be perpetuated unless we’re taught by professors who don’t conform to this attitude and are willing to make us think outside this box. ,However, it’s not enough to increase the number of professors of colour. We must build an academic culture where non-white content is acknowledged as significant and valuable, where non-white professors really want to work and teach at Queen’s, and where non-white students can look to the front of the classroom and see that there’s a future for them in academics.,Professors often do a lot more than instruct our courses. We go to them for reference letters, career advice, even life advice. If the student body can’t see itself reflected in its mentors, then that faculty is failing them.,However, these reasons for increasing diversity have already been acknowledged and accepted as important. So why then is this still an issue?,Queen’s hasn’t entirely ignored its diversity-complex in the past. But neither has it been the problem of the day.,The last look into racism in Queen’s faculty was the Henry Report in 2004. While this report highlighted a culture of whiteness and racism at Queen’s, the study’s small sample size and outdated results makes it an unreliable picture of the current state of affairs.,Yet, another report hasn’t been undertaken. The University did publish the Diversity, Anti-Racism and Equity (DARE) Report in 2009, which focused on making recommendations for the University’s diversity efforts. ,But these one-off initiatives have failed to properly address an ongoing and systematic issue for which we have little data.,Without close scrutiny, diversity is forgotten after the initial hiring of a candidate. Non-white faculty face systemic problems that can’t simply be solved by ensuring equitable hiring practices. More can — and should — be done to ensure that professors of colour stay at Queen’s and are promoted equally.  ,It doesn’t help that there’s a lack of diversity among the ranks of top university officials, which is often unaddressed and has a trickle-down effect to the rest of university staff and faculty.,In the face of this immense task, diversifying content may be a more achievable short-term objective than diversifying faculty. Faculty contracts come up once in a blue moon while course content can be changed far more frequently.,But there’s a snag. Under Queen’s current funding model, courses are approved based on their ability to attract students to fill the seats. This means that new courses struggle to obtain funding, while traditional, canonical courses are guaranteed to run.,But while introducing new and diverse content may be less financially sound than traditional course content, it’s the right thing to do.,The two go hand in hand: diversity among the faculty will lead to diversity in content and curricula. But, the catch-22 is that without a demonstrated willingness to diversify content, it’s unlikely that Queen’s can attract professors to teach those topics.,Diversity may be an upstream battle, but it’s one worth fighting.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Mental recovery equally important for concussion patients ","url":"/story/2016-02-29/editorials/mental-recovery-equally-important-for-concussion-patients/","date":"March 1, 2016","content":"Minimize light.

This ensures that we’re transparent and don’t mislead readers. ,In light of the AMS’s misrepresentation of The Journal’s editorial, they might be advised to do the same.  ,On Tuesday night, the AMS published a blog post entitled “The Journal is Wrong About AGM, Here’s Why”. In it, they implied  that The Journal had recommended to the AMS that they reinstate the Annual General Assembly (AGM) as a means for passing student fees.,This blog post was a response to The Journal’s editorial “Student fee policy leaves StuCons hanging”. Our editorial discussed a change in AMS policy, which made a student-wide referendum the only avenue for passing or increasing student fees. ,The editorial laid out the problems caused by the change — exemplified by the Queen’s Student Constables (StuCons) failing to get a fee increase, despite a legitimate need for funding.,Nowhere did the editorial state that reinstating the AGM was the answer. ,In fact, the editorial clearly stated that “An AGM that allows huge and unnecessary student fees isn’t desirable” — just in case anyone should assume that was our suggestion. ,We did say, “there needs to be a way for services that are necessary to receive the funding they need.” And we stand by that argument. ,The AMS is well aware of the problems StuCons face. But students voting at the referendum weren’t. There’s a problem with that, and it’s one that we don’t think the AMS would disagree with. ,Democracy can’t work if voters are uninformed on what they’re voting on. And while a referendum may have reached more students than an AGM, the AMS’s claim that it reached 17,000 students drastically overestimates the number of students who actually voted on it.  ,The AMS’s response ignored clear evidence of the flaws in their new system that resulted in the underfunding of an essential student service. They instead resorted to an attack on Queen’s University’s student newspaper based on an inaccurate assumption. ,The AMS implying The Journal is against democracy — aside from their misinterpretation of our editorial — is ironic considering The Journal contacted the AMS several times regarding recent incidents involving StuCons, only to be denied comment. Their Communications Officer declined to comment, stating that an article on the reality of working as a StuCon may dissuade students from applying for the position.,The AMS’s newfound love of referenda also comes at the tail end of a year where they nullified the fall referendum in a closed door meeting to which student groups affected by the decision weren’t invited. The AMS did not clarify the reasons for their decision until 13 days after the referendum, even when asked directly in an interview with The Journal.,When the situation calls for it, the AMS is not above making decisions behind closed doors without asking for every student’s opinion. ,The AMS can’t follow their principles only when it’s convenient to do so. ,It’s galling to be called undemocratic by a group of student politicians who resist attempts to be held accountable and miss opportunities to be transparent. ,But we shouldn’t be having a “Who’s the most democratic?” contest right now. We should be discussing whether this policy change is what’s best for students in light of what happened to the StuCon fee. ,The AMS made a change that negatively impacted students. They’re now being called out on it, but their response has been to ignore the issue and cling to a narrative of promoting democracy that hasn’t worked out in this case.,We don’t call for student government to listen less to students, but we do expect that the AMS will act in the best interests of students. And there’s no question that the StuCon fee failing to pass was not in students’ best interests. ,We suggest the AMS take steps to avoid that happening again. ,But, instead, their solution is that StuCons — who are underpaid and often harassed — simply put on a smiling face and campaign even harder, just like MUSE Magazine. But with all due respect to MUSE, a lifestyle magazine isn’t as essential to student life as a security service. ,No one likes to be criticized. But good government means being open to constructive criticism. ,It’s the AMS’s prerogative to disagree with The Journal’s opinion, as long as they get it right. We welcome open discussion because that’s how we arrive at the best solution. What we don’t welcome is a refusal to face the real issue at hand. ,At the end of the day, valuable input from the AMS requires them to be factually correct, respectful and professional, as befits student leaders. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"BDS has no place in student government","url":"/story/2016-03-10/editorials/bds-has-no-place-in-student-governments/","date":"March 11, 2016","content":"While it’s essential for institutions to practice freedom of expression, there’s no place for intolerance at a university. ,This is especially true in student government, where neutrality should be upheld.  ,On Feb. 22, over 900 students gathered for the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) Winter General Assembly. ,Of the students who attended, 58 per cent voted in favour of a motion for the SSMU to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement — a movement that condemns Israel through the boycott and divestment of Israeli companies, who allegedly profit from the violation of Palestinian human rights. ,Following the meeting, the motion went to an online vote, where students had the opportunity to officially decide the motion’s fate. ,Fortunately, the BDS motion was nullified — 57 per cent to 43 per cent. ,While the motion’s nullification is a relief for some pro-Israel students, the intolerance that’s spreading on McGill’s campus is unacceptable. ,McGill student Rayna Lew told the Montreal Gazette that targeted tweets by McGill BDS supporters towards Jews and Zionists has been frustrating. ,“[T]hese tweets literally insinuate that I am not entitled to a safe space as a Jew and zionist,” she posted on Facebook. ,Academic settings should be neutral spaces for students of diversified backgrounds to come and learn. With that in mind, it would be inappropriate for the student government to support the BDS movement, which marginalizes thousands of students who identify with Israel and rely on their student government to represent their concerns. ,The BDS movement has become a reoccurring issue on and off McGill’s campus. In the past year and a half, the motion to have McGill’s student government support BDS has been voted on three times, though unsuccessfully.,During this time, McGill’s administration remained quiet “out of respect for the student governance process,” according to a blog post by McGill Principal Suzannne Fortier. After the motion was shot down, Fortier stated “the administration of the University will have no part of the BDS movement.”,McGill’s administration shouldn’t be divisive on such issues that would result in marginalizing thousands of students, nor should they engage in acts of intolerance. ,Student governments should practice similarly appropriate behavior as their administrative counterparts. Motions that have an intolerant and divisive nature, such as BDS, shouldn’t be brought to the table in the first place. ,Erika is The Journal’s Lifestyle Editor.

But when dark and explicit humour comes from a woman, some audiences just don’t bust a gut. And from my experience, some guys would rather stare at your well-lit boobs instead of listening for the punch line.,Crafting the perfect comedy set as a woman is an interesting balancing act.,As an experienced amateur comedian, I have discovered that no one listens to a full set of clean family humour with labeling the comedy prudish, but too many sex jokes cause mutterings of “tramp”.,As comedian Aisha Tyler put it: “Women are not socialized to be aggressive. We are very much kind of told by culture to be precious, be pretty, be cute, and comedy is not precious, or pretty, or cute.”,Comedy is an aggressive form of entertainment — it consists of one person yelling jokes at an entire room.,But the industry standard of “man up or get out” isn’t acceptable, especially with other significant barriers to success female stand-ups must overcome to make it to the main stage.,Heckling is a common problem across the board, but when there’s a female stand-up, some audiences are more likely to yell back. I think this is because of the smaller physical form and quieter personalities of many women and comics.,Getting heckled really bad when you first start stand-up comedy is like losing your virginity to a guy who doesn’t call you back. The show must go on, but this precious experience is now marked. It can be difficult to get back on stage as an amateur after a negative encounter.,A comedian’s life on the road is also more conducive to men.

I can’t count the number of times I’ve cringed when one of the women said something vapid, or swooned to a man’s grand declarations of love. It’s absolutely ridiculous and demeaning to all involved. However, I keep finding myself, along with my friends, watching it week after week.,Why is that? Most would attribute it to the escapism most reality shows provide — it’s so far from everyday life that you can’t help but be intrigued. But escaping into these shows does more harm than good.,All surface-level productions, from television to movies, follow a very strict dichotomy of men and women. Men are always masculine and buff, women are always ,pore-less and emotional. When we escape into these shows, we’re straying from the understanding that these stereotypes are unrealistic, and fall into an oppressive mentality.,The media is now open to the grey area that falls between masculine and feminine ideals — for instance, Louis Vuitton’s Spring 2016 campaign features Jaden Smith in womenswear. A world without gendered labels is on the horizon, which means that the gender binary will become less rigid and stereotypes of men and women will start to intersect.,But despite this push, reality TV remains a place where people go to escape from their daily lives. And while it’s entertaining to watch someone embarrass themselves on national television, using these shows to escape from our much more complicated lives slides us back into a mindset ruled by constructed gender dichotomies. ,Although entertaining, shows like The Bachelor represent an understanding of the world that’s no longer legitimate, and viewers must remain aware of that. ,Don’t use these shows as an escape from your day-to-day life, but watch them to revel in the relatively free and open world we now have.,In the future, I hope the “reality” of reality TV will reflect our changing gender roles.Hopefully then it will no longer be shocking when individuals don’t conform to traditional male and female stereotypes. ,Because life and dating aren’t as simple as The Bachelor — and they don’t need to be.,Kayla is The Journal’s Digital Manager.

The person who should’ve been punished is the student who took the Snapchat in the first place.

It’s despicable that a student feels scared to come to school, especially without any redress by the institution.,In adhering too closely to policy, administrators sometimes don’t exercise discrimination on whether their decisions are correct or not. ,Technically, this student did post something inappropriate on social media, but the context in which she did so makes all the difference. ,Educators are supposed to be role models for students who are young and impressionable, and this suspension sent absolutely the wrong message. ,Using social media to call someone out isn’t the same as a verbal confrontation. Anyone can chime in, and it stays up forever. In light of these students’ young age, there may have been a better way to address racism than immortalizing it on the Internet. ,But there’s no way this student is going to learn how to confront racism effectively if she’s simply sent home from school. ,The bottom line is that making racist comments is far more reprehensible than calling out those comments, regardless of the way in which she did it.,— Journal Editorial Board  "},{"title":"Female professors deserve better ","url":"/story/2016-02-01/editorials/female-professors-deserve-better/","date":"February 2, 2016","content":"Actions speak louder than words.

For one, structural barriers prevent women from being promoted, entering high-paying disciplines or conducting research.,There’s also a distinct disparity between disciplines that women do or do not enter. As a result, there aren’t enough female candidates to draw from to fill underrepresented faculties.,But we’ve already established that we have a problem. It’s time for the next step.,In the long term, there’s work to be done to encourage people from diverse backgrounds to enter disciplines where they’re underrepresented, so there will be enough candidates in the future to draw from.  ,In the meantime, we need to address the existing inequalities. To do this, we need more concrete and specific data on where underrepresented groups are falling through the cracks.,Queen’s releases some data, but it’s only general representation rates. There’s no way to find out how much female professors make compared to their male colleagues — unless they make over $100,000 and are on the Sunshine List.,As a result, we don’t have a clear picture of how underrepresentation is really affecting female professors and contributing to a wage gap.,We need transparent data.

This is mostly because news outlets don’t report on religions or religious topics. Instead they highlight an act of terrorism and state that it was driven by religion, but they forget to discuss the diversity of the religion behind it.,Current discussion, be it in everyday conversation or in politics and news, stops before any education can take place. ,We must begin to approach the taboo on religion in the same ways we approach talking about racism and homophobia — by letting go of stereotypes and being open to conversation. ,It also requires patience and letting go of the belief that only one religion (or no religion) has to be the correct one.,Steph is one of The Journal’s Photo Editors.

They’re instead included on a student body-wide referendum. ,While decisions that affect students should include student feedback, there are exceptions to every rule — and the Student Constables (StuCon) fee increase that failed to pass is one of them. ,It isn’t difficult to understand why students would vote against StuCons getting more money. Apart from it being a mandatory fee that comes out of your pocket, StuCons are the ones who kick you out of the bar at the end of the night.,But the point of the service is to keep other students safe. Moreover, discipline often works far better coming from a peer who may be able to sympathize. ,And StuCons weren’t looking for this fee increase to buy themselves some party hats — they needed the money.,The provincial government requires expensive and mandatory security training. Without this training, StuCons can’t do their job, but this increases the cost for student groups to book StuCons for large events or events where alcohol is served. ,StuCons are already underpaid, because while minimum wage has increased, their salary hasn’t.  ,In their report to the AMS, StuCons identified difficulty in hiring and retaining employees due to the low compensation and high demands of the positions. ,StuCons also fulfill part of the AMS’s mandate to provide job opportunities to students. But the current compensation for a StuCon doesn’t make it a very desirable opportunity. ,Despite this legitimate need, StuCons didn’t receive funding, most likely because students don’t realize how beneficial StuCons are to Queen’s student life. ,Without StuCons, we wouldn’t have Queen’s Pub, the Underground or Clark Hall as we know them. We wouldn’t have formals, conferences or the Frosh concert. And the list goes on. ,Without having a security force present, these places or events aren’t allowed, and clubs and societies are very limited in the scope of events they can hold.  ,It’s the AMS’s responsibility to do what’s best for students.

And with the addition of the nullified fall referendum questions, wading through the winter referendum became more onerous than usual. ,In the end, this fee really should have been thoroughly discussed, instead of ending up as a one-line question on a ballot for students uninformed on its importance to vote on. ,An AGM that allows huge and unnecessary student fees isn’t desirable, but there needs to be a way for services that are necessary to receive the funding they need. ,If we don’t have that, we risk damaging the services that are supposed to make student life better.    ,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"School of Medicine a brave guinea pig  ","url":"/story/2016-02-01/editorials/school-of-medicine-a-brave-guinea-pig/","date":"February 2, 2016","content":"A new educational model could bring out the best in Queen’s medical school residents.,In 2017, Queen’s School of Medicine will be the first Canadian medical school to adopt competency-based medical education (CBME), a system that evaluates residents on whether they’ve reached a certain level of competency rather than simply the hours spent in a hospital.,Working in a hospital isn’t like taking a test — it’s unpredictable and full of unanticipated challenges.

It’s sexy to squat. It’s hip to be fit. Except it isn’t.,Recently, a trend towards the celebration of fitness has arisen on social media, like a phoenix from the ashes of super skinny models of days gone by. This trend is known as “fitspiration” and it centres on women encouraging each other to eat well and hit the gym so that you, yes you, can have a body just like this.,While this movement reaches towards something like a genuine appreciation for strong women, it falls short in two ways.,The first is that many of the women celebrated as so-called fitness models present the same, thin bodies we’ve always called beautiful — the only difference is that those bodies are now inside sports bras and spandex shorts.,These aren’t the bodies of competitive athletes, up before the crack of dawn for practice, eating whatever they need to fuel their training. These bodies are too often the result of crash dieting or other dangerous practices. Yet they rake in praise for themselves and cash for their sponsors posting scantily-clad selfies with sporty captions and endless hashtags. ,Raising them up as beacons of fitness sidelines the real-life athletes who rise and grind in pursuit of performance. By leaving the women who actually participate in competitive sport outside this “fit” ideal for women’s bodies, we don’t seem to be celebrating fitness at all.,The second issue I take with this trend pertains to what these women are doing — which is nothing. On Instagram, #fitspiration is attached to over 6,000,000 images. They mostly aren’t of women demonstrating their fitness so much as they’re of women posing in their underwear.,Strength and fitness don’t exist in visible six-packs or even bulging biceps. They’re skills we demonstrate through movement — moving ourselves quickly, moving heavy loads, moving with accuracy and technique. ,If we want to celebrate strong women, we need to concern ourselves with more than how “toned” she looks.,We need to consider what women can do — how they’re improving their bodies to perform better, how their training develops them into better athletes, better students and better friends. ,Real strength isn’t visible in a still frame.

A piece on how “strong isn’t the new skinny” received almost 50 times as much readership as The Journal’s coverage of the AMS debate, and our AMS news coverage was on par with articles on the environmental benefits of eating less meat and poor workplaces in Kingston.,Of course, it’s our mandate to provide students with information about the elections, regardless of interest. And plenty of students were interested. However, it’s confirmed for me that student politics are generally of interest to only a core group of politically-minded students — and there’s nothing wrong with that.,Student apathy has been talked to death, almost to the point of a full-blown neurosis. Combatting apathy is a key part of most campaigns and it’s always a topic at AMS debates. Yet the central mission of the AMS is to advocate for students and provide good services, not to make students care about it.,Many student readers appear to care deeply about workplace standards, the environment and racism, but less so about the AMS. That’s OK. They’re allowed not to care and even not to vote, if it comes to that. I’d encourage them to vote — because there’s a lot the AMS can do for them — but a lack of interest in the student government doesn’t indicate an apathy epidemic.,It’s possible to be a highly-engaged student who doesn’t care a whole lot about student politics. I know because I’ve met them. They’re involved in engineering design teams, commerce conferences, social advocacy groups, campus publications — the list goes on — but not in the AMS. ,It’s also possible to like, and even work for, a service like Queen’s Pub but not particularly care who runs it. The AMS doesn’t pave our streets or change local laws. ,It’s an advocacy body that runs wonderful services and supports other campus organizations, but aspiring to high office in the AMS isn’t the pinnacle of the student experience. ,The AMS is well-suited to students with an interest in governance and public service. It’s a place for students with particular advocacy concerns and a resource for student clubs. But it’s not an organization that needs the full attention of all students all the time. ,Putting such immense pressure on the AMS to deal with apathy is unfair. The onus is on the AMS to make students aware of its services and the student elections, but there’s an equal responsibility on the shoulders of students to go to the AMS when they want something done.  ,Students who want our student societies to take a particular stance can always get involved and vote for the teams they support.

Vaid had only been interviewed for the Globe and Mail’s coverage of the incident, but the Globe article didn’t state her religion. ,Mistakes happen, but a news source that presents themselves as a credible, and has 38,000 Twitter followers, has a duty to be truthful.

Getting an education isn’t likely to decrease in its costliness in the near future. ,So, a more permanent solution is needed than a four-year freeze. ,We need to take a time-out to figure out an effective formula for governmental funding that will subsidize post-secondary education to the point that it’s accessible.  ,Maybe, in the short term, the solution is more need-based bursaries and scholarships so that those whose socio-economic status is a barrier to attending a post-secondary school have the same opportunities as everyone else. ,In the long term though, we will need to decide how much we value having an educated population, and how much we are willing to spend to make it a reality. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Sharing is caring ","url":"/story/2016-01-29/editorials/sharing-is-caring/","date":"January 29, 2016","content":"Bridging the divide between university and college brings benefits to both sides. ,Earlier this month, Queen’s and St. Lawrence announced a joint degree program in biotechnology that will be offered next September.

In the end, SCAP and the University’s Senate will be the ones to approve the proposal. ,Many Canadians universities are embracing the Fall Reading Week, recognizing that students are especially vulnerable to mental illness. ,Implementing a Fall Reading Week, while a small measure, has the potential to prevent the stress that leads to mental health issues.,Many students already take every opportunity to travel home. Some even skip classes to lengthen their time with family. ,Having an official break from classes would allow students who live farther away, or who don’t have the finances for travel costs, to justify travelling home — minus the added strain of making up for missed classes. ,However, since student wellness is the reason behind a Fall Reading Week, it only stands to reason that students should be a part of the process.,In November, the AMS hosted two town hall meetings to garner student feedback on the SCAP proposal. However, the small portion of students who went to these meetings don’t represent the concerns of the whole.,To get a better sense of student needs, the University could present potential proposals to students, survey them for their opinions and conduct a student vote. Ultimately, the decision should come from the student body, and not the University Senate. ,The importance of student input is essential, because the last thing we want is a break that creates more problems than it solves. ,Parts of SCAP’s proposal seems to stem from a misunderstanding of how students operate — for example, taking away crucial time for studying at the most stressful time of term. Two precious days to study for exams can mean the difference between a pass and a fail. Trading in strategic days for the sake of alleviating stress would, ironically, only add stress by making it harder to budget time for exams. ,A potential solution — instead of cutting short the exam study period — would be to scale back Orientation Week by a day or two. This would still allow for the tradition to continue, but could add a couple of desperately needed study days in the right places. ,When weighed against improving your classmates’ mental health, it doesn’t seem too high a cost. ,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Aboriginal courses are relevant to students, so make them a priority","url":"/story/2016-01-07/editorials/aboriginal-courses-are-relevant-to-students-so-make-them-a-priority/","date":"January 8, 2016","content":"Expanding learning about Indigenous peoples is essential for the Canadian education system — but force-feeding it to students doesn’t make it any more palatable. ,In light of Canada’s prioritization of truth and reconciliation, universities are integrating Aboriginal issues into our education. ,For some universities, like the University of Regina and the University of Winnipeg, that involves creating a mandatory Indigenous course requirement for all students. ,While mandating core courses may make sense for universities with high Aboriginal student populations, like Regina and Winnipeg, it doesn’t for others like Queen’s.,Forcing students to take Aboriginal topics without addressing their significance to students’ education does a disservice to the importance of that subject. ,The problem with mandatory courses is that they try to force people to find a subject relevant to them, but often backfire because they’re perceived as a waste of time. ,When you reach university, the expectation is that you’ll get to specialize in what interests you. ,The perceived uselessness of mandatory courses is only compounded by a lower impetus to maintain their quality, since students will take them anyways.,Long-lasting change requires Queen’s and similar schools to take on a form of affirmative action, where Aboriginal content is incorporated in such a way that people take it of their own accord because of its relevance. ,Mandating learning about Aboriginal peoples for noble or politically correct reasons — despite the validity of those reasons — mistakes the essential point behind a university education. ,Arguing for education on Aboriginal issues on the basis of our moral duty ignores the far more pertinent reasoning: that learning about Aboriginal culture is entirely relevant to most, if not all, current and future university students’ careers. ,Interacting with Aboriginal people and communities is necessary for most major professions in Canada — from law, to medicine, to politics, education, engineering and commerce. The list goes on. ,Queen’s has already recognized this within certain disciplines, such as ConEd, where it’s mandatory for future teachers to be educated on Aboriginal culture and issues. ,Whether someone is a healthcare provider who needs ,to know about the health risks of boiled water advisories on reservations, or an engineer working on treaty-contested land, the practical value of learning about Aboriginal issues is undeniable. ,This isn’t, however, self-evident for many university students, nor is its relevance to their career path. ,So, one mandatory course that has nothing to do with a student’s course of study, while beneficial to learn for its own sake, won’t impress relevance of this learning to the student’s own life. ,It’s better to teach Indigenous issues in a manner that’s compatible with each discipline’s aims and pedagogy, based on what students going into that field really need to know. ,Many people are completely unaware of Indigenous issues, or they simply don’t care. The topic receives a lot of lip service that doesn’t put its money where its mouth is. ,New courses take money. But there are always ways to take action. ,Queen’s Principal’s Dream Course Initiative, which provides funds for enhancing existing courses, lists Indigenous content as a potential criteria for funding, but that’s a tiny drop in a huge lake, and we need a rainstorm. ,There’s no tried and true way to introduce Aboriginal content that will work across all faculties. ,And there are many potential routes: a special fund set up to distribute funding for courses on Indigenous topics; an advancement campaign to raise funds for new courses; or updating the criteria set by each department for course approval to include Indigenous perspectives.  ,Whatever strategy Queen’s ends up using, we need to commit to it. ,Knowing the University, ‘Indigenization’ at Queen’s will involve the creation of multiple different committees, review boards and advisory bodies. ,Reviewing each faculty with the objective of creating a unique strategic plan to introduce Indigenous content based on the faculty’s needs might be an exhaustive process.,But it has to start somewhere.  ,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Made in Canada matters ","url":"/story/2016-01-11/editorials/made-in-canada-matters/","date":"January 12, 2016","content":"While students are easily tempted by the cheaper option, it’s not always the best one. ,In the long run, opting for locally-made products is preferable to buying cheap, mass produced goods.

And while operating locally endures a hefty cost, it provides a greater return.  ,It’s this circulation of money from one person to another that strengthens a nation’s economy and allows for individuals to prosper.,A 2013 Civic Economics study on B.C. stores and restaurants discovered that local businesses distributed approximately 2.6 times the amount of money locally compared to chains.,Opting for locally-made goods pumps and re-circulates money in our society — whereas buying from a big-box store drains money as it’s outsourced to other places.,Locally-made products also benefit the environment by reducing our carbon footprint. Internationally-manufactured products may travel through several manufacturers during the process, consuming fuels and emitting poisonous materials before they finally arrive in stores.,While countries may implement environmental protection laws, some international manufacturers don’t adhere to them. In China, for example, past environmental protection laws included a set fine for polluters. Nevertheless, wealthier manufacturers continued polluting, because it was more cost-effective to pay the fine than to taper production.,Buying locally limits these emissions from manufacturers and keeps production as simple as farm-to-table dining.

But as employees, their needs aren’t catered to like your average undergrad. Grad students fall in between — and somehow, they often lose out on both worlds.,Nowhere is this more evident than in the mental health resources available to grad students.,Grad students face a unique set of circumstances — high stress and frequent loneliness — that make them particularly vulnerable to severe mental illness.,They spend a lot of time working alone and carry heavy workloads that combine their own research with teaching and all its responsibilities, leaving little time for socializing. ,In the long-term, the function and role of grad students needs to be reevaluated to resolve its systemic issues.,In the short-term, better support is needed. Currently, there is only one grad counselor, who is also in the midst of completing his own post-graduate work.,Financially strapped as the University is, calls for more funding and more resources often fall on deaf ears. With that in mind, here are things we could do within existing resources to alleviate grad students’ stress:,Increasing students’ access to different forms of counseling is beneficial. The Online Psychology Network that opened to undergraduate students this year is an example of ways to work creatively within our existing resources to offer better mental health services.,The Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS) currently offers a peer-advising service and organizes social activities. However, with their current restructuring, some of these activities have fallen by the wayside.,The onus is on the SGPS to make an effort to address the concerns of their members as best they can. With that in mind, it’s always a good idea to start from a foundation of indisputable knowledge.,The SGPS and Student Wellness Services (SWS, formerly HCDS) can work together to gather data to create a conclusive picture of the prevalence and nature of issues among grad students. For instance, UBC’s Grad Student Society recently launched a website where grad students can confidentially submit their stories about discrimination or harassment. Something similar, but focused on mental health at Queen’s, would give SWS and the SGPS a better idea of the challenges they’re facing.,Another potential option for data gathering is the upcoming 2016 NCHA Student Health and Wellness Survey, which will be conducted this February. Based on the 2013 data published by Queen’s, the survey’s questions seem to be more undergraduate-focused. However, it could be an opportunity for better understanding graduate difficulties.,We make these suggestions with supporting grad students in mind, so counselors can focus on serious mental health concerns.,At the end of the day, the SGPS is made up of students who may be dealing with the same problems they’re trying to fix for their peers. While the SGPS has a role to advocate and investigate, they can only do so much before the next step is to direct someone to the proper professional resources. But that only works if those resources exist.,We can talk about peer societies and student-run resources until we’re blue in the face, but it doesn’t change the bottom line: there needs to be more than one counselor for 4,000 grad students. Unavoidably, that means allocating more funding will be necessary.,Grad students need counselors who understand their circumstances. Otherwise, counselling has about the same effectiveness of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.,But the only counselor designated specifically for grad students is so overworked that soon we're going to need a counselor for the counselor.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Vandalism isn’t the solution,  but Kingston’s love affair with Sir John A.

Macdonald’s birthday, red paint was dumped on MP Mark Gerretsen and event organizer Arthur Milnes’ cars. The latter’s tires were also slashed and a burned Canadian flag was found beneath the car. ,Idle No More, an Indigenous activist group, protested the celebration — which took place despite the vandalism — by burning an effigy of Macdonald at the event. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Macdonald commissioned the residential school system. ,Apart from being criminal, the vandalism leaves an unfavourable impression. Whatever the vandals’ intentions, their actions did more to threaten the integrity of Idle No More’s protest than further its cause. ,Burning a Canadian flag is especially upsetting, as it makes a personal attack on all Canadians, not just Macdonald himself.,The greater concern is that the Kingston community might look at the actions of anonymous vandals and blame Idle No More. We need to be careful that we don’t allow ourselves or others to jump to that conclusion, as there’s no factual basis for it. ,When marginalized groups protest, mainstream discourse has a tendency to focus on how they say something, not what they’re saying. It’s a sad truth that without the vandalism angle, people probably wouldn’t be talking about the Idle No More protest at all.,But, in light of the earlier vandalism, the group’s burning effigy of a human body took on a more violent tone. Rather than provide a strong image to make a point, it made people scared for their safety, most notably the choir that cancelled its appearance. ,Meanwhile, the organizers of the event continued the celebration with a show of bravado. ,While the group’s public impression is important to their cause, we should remember that the validity of an oppressed group’s protest isn’t dependent on their good behaviour.,This isn’t an opportunity to equate vandalism with the Idle No More movement, but to instead look at the deeper root causes of why they’re protesting Macdonald’s birthday celebration. ,There are few words more dreaded than: “We need to talk.”,But we really need to talk about Kingston’s obsession with Sir John A. Macdonald.  ,Things have changed since the 19th century when Macdonald was Prime Minister. His policies are no longer supportable and by honouring his contribution to Canada we’re continuing to uphold a legacy that’s outlived any semblance of legitimacy. ,So why hasn’t Kingston taken Macdonald off his pedestal? The statues, roads and schools named after Macdonald unilaterally tell his story as a founding hero, albeit one with a drinking problem. It makes sense for Kingston in particular to celebrate him because he brings in the crowds.  ,But we don’t have to look at Macdonald like a founding saint simply because that’s the way it’s always been done. ,Kingston should want to be known for something more than a man whose legacy is inextricably tied to cultural genocide. ,No politician who values their career is going to say they don’t care about Aboriginal issues. But it’s easy to say you care, it’s easy to appear at community events, take a photo or shake a hand. The hard part is being willing to let go of tradition when it becomes the right thing to do. ,Until we stop parading our colonial history, decolonization will remain something that is talked about everywhere, and acted upon nowhere. ,It’s time for Kingston to blow out the birthday candles and stand on the right side of history.  ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Special accommodations shouldn’t require hoops of fire ","url":"/story/2016-01-18/editorials/special-accommodations-shouldnt-require-hoops-of-fire/","date":"January 19, 2016","content":"In the wake of events at York, it’s worth considering whether other universities should review their mental health accommodation policies.,A two-year legal battle between a student and York University — over the University’s requirement that students disclose their specific diagnosis to receive academic accommodations — ended recently in a settlement.,York will no longer require students to name their specific condition. However, they still require students to be assessed by a medical professional to ascertain their need for special accommodations.,Requiring students to be labeled with a specific illness imposes an unfair burden on those students to prove their need. Not only do students require a medical assessment, but they must submit detailed information regarding their diagnosis and functional limitations to qualify for accommodations.,Adopting a less rigorous process, where students aren’t required to fulfill a very specific set of criteria, would reduce a great deal of stress for students who are already struggling.,Having an accredited medical professional state that a student requires academic accommodations should be enough to warrant that support.,Likewise, labeling students with specific diagnoses may not take into consideration the minutiae of each student’s situation in the same way a health care practitioner might. For instance, giving a student with ADD more time to write an exam may not do them much good if you’re not aware that their medication makes them drowsy at that time of day.,The purpose of academic accommodations is to shape the environment to a particular student’s needs instead of assuming that all students have the same ones. However, it’s difficult for an administration to build an environment without adequately knowing the needs of students.,So, reforming a university's academic accommodations policy will only be worthwhile if the new process compensates for administrators’ new ignorance of a student’s specific condition. ,The question then is this: does not knowing a student’s specific condition compromise an administrators’ ability to assist them? If other universities do follow York’s example, can they compensate for any gaps in knowledge?,If the medical professional providing recommendations is competent and familiar with the university’s ability to meet recommendations, the answer is yes.,On a different note, recognizing a student’s right to not disclose their condition shouldn’t be taken as a sign that having a learning disability or a mental illness is something to be ashamed of.,Nor should the common objection, that this will just make it easier for people who don’t have a legitimate need to get special treatment, hold any weight. Students with special accommodations aren’t doing less work — they’re simply completing it in a different way. , At the end of the day, universities can be expected to do what’s reasonable to accommodate their students based on the information they have.,But, it isn’t reasonable to subject students to a process that can be more taxing than the exam they’re requesting to write in a separate room.,— Journal Editorial Board ,Queen's does not require students to disclose a mental health diagnosis for academic accommodations.

(*See Editor's Note below),This isn’t the first time the AMS has bungled the election. Technical difficulties forced an extension to the election period this year, while concerns in the past include students being completely left out and emails being misdirected. ,The main role of the AMS is the collection and allocation of funds. The vast majority of interaction between students and the AMS involves paying their student fees, and then getting a say in where those fees end up. ,The clubs whose funding is now threatened offer important services to students, and the proper handling of their funding is perhaps the most important service students require from their student government. ,So, while it might make for a more lively AMS assembly to talk about adding more chairs in CoGro or making an app to count the number of people using the ARC, the AMS and students would be better served by a shift in focus back to the AMS’s actual purpose. ,Student apathy is often blamed for low voter turnout during the referendum, but if the AMS continues to waste students’ time and money, engagement will sink even lower — and it won’t be students’ apathy that’s at fault. ,The CEO’s only responsibility is dealing with elections. Appointing someone who was ineligible to hold that position — thus compromising the integrity of the entire election — is a fairly regrettable hiring decision.,But what’s more regrettable is that the AMS didn’t come forward and explain the mistake, and their decision. ,Instead, they had a closed door meeting to which none of the clubs affected by the decision were invited, then informed the clubs of their decision after the fact and told them to keep it confidential. ,The decision wasn’t even publicly announced until over a week after it had been made. ,The entire decision-making process lacked any transparency. The possibility of other options, such as only nullifying those results decided by a small margin, was never presented to affected students until after the decision had been made.,Nor was the questionable correlation between the CEO not paying their student fees, and therefore lacking integrity, ever explained. ,Legal concerns aside, there was a more open conversation to be had here between the AMS and the student body they represent.,But instead of focusing on how this decision would impact students, the AMS unilaterally decided to let their bureaucratic blunder get in the way of student well-being.,What’s done is done, but hopefully the AMS can take a lesson from this and be more open with students in the future. ,— Journal Editorial Board,*Editor’s note: Leah Kelley, the co-chair of the Queen’s Backing Action on Climate Change, told The Journal that Jon Wiseman, the AMS commissioner of internal affairs, informed her that the CEO was ineligible because she had not paid her student fees.

Though smaller in scope, LWT’s platform has a greater degree of feasibility than CSG’s platform promises.  ,However, while LWT’s promises are achievable, the Journal Board considers CSG’s objectives to better address the realities of campus life.,While LWT’s objectives seek to reestablish the AMS as the center of student life, CSG’s vision sees the AMS operate more as a support for the rich student life that takes place outside the AMS. ,CSG’s attention to combating a culture of homogeneity and exclusivity in the student body in general, not just in the internal structure of the AMS, is promising. Their overly-ambitious platform is too large an undertaking for them to deliver all points in their term alone, but it aims in the right direction.,CSG’s candidates — Colin Zarzour, Sarah Anderson and Greg Radisic — are collectively far more suited to each of the roles they’re running for than their counterparts on LWT. ,Presidential candidate Zarzour shows the ability to be a leader with a vision and passion for student life. Vice-President (Operations)candidate Anderson displays the drive and diligence needed to succeed in a detail-oriented and exacting position, and her experience working in marketing in the AMS will prove valuable. Vice-President (University Affairs) candidate Radisic — who’s currently the president of the Residence Society and deals a great deal with first years — appears approachable and in touch with the concerns of students. ,CSG has a level of sincerity and cohesion that’s somewhat lacking in the makeup of their opponent’s dynamic.

When serious issues arise, having an AMS team whose tendency is to seek the opinions of students will make them more accountable to their constituents. ,CSG’s focus on equity and their acknowledgement of their own privilege is a promising sign of their ability to do what both teams are pledging by opening up the AMS to a greater diversity of students. ,While LWT looks good on paper, CSG’s vision and passion will carry them through the demands of an AMS executive position. ,But CSG should be careful that they don’t fall into the trap of promising too much and succeeding in little.

However, the University's stated reason for removing him was not a judgement on his language so much that handing out a waiver violated the University's policies. ,Our two Features Editors debate whether profane language has a place in the classroom. ,,Coarse language not necessary,While it’s important for university classrooms to use a variety of methods to encourage open discussion, Laurentian Professor Michael Persinger’s use of profanity overstepped the bounds.,Professor Persinger was removed from teaching an introductory psychology class due to his request that students sign a waiver complying with his use of profane language for the purpose of teaching.,Although the university was unclear whether the primary concern was the waiver or the language, the broader issue is worth examining — should professors be able to use profanities as a teaching tool in university classes?,In his explanation, Persinger stated that the coarse language he planned to use was for the purposes of professional development.,However, the problem with that argument is that many other professions could use similar logic to suggest the use of coarse language in education. Deciding where the divide lies between necessary and unnecessary use of profanities as a teaching tool can become a slippery slope.,Profane language is already an ingrained part of our culture, visible in our entertainment industry, our personal lives and even within many workplaces. The university setting shouldn’t follow the same trajectory, or lower its expectations for conduct, just because it seems like an easy way to make an impression on students.,Allowing offensive language in an introductory course, where students are just beginning to get acquainted with university and their chosen fields, is counterintuitive to wanting students to both speak up in the classroom and become comfortable with its subject matter.,The purpose of a classroom is to educate, and there are numerous methods available to make that happen other than shock value.,While it’s up to the professor of the course how they choose to teach, the presence of the administration is to curb potentially problematic approaches to provide the best educational experience possible for their students.,Professors shouldn’t have to coddle their students. But neither should we lower our standards for behaviour when it comes to teaching complex subject matter.,Anastasiya is one of The Journal’s Features Editors. She’s a second-year PhD student in the History Department.  , ,Colourful language not so black and white,University isn’t like Thanksgiving dinner — you can make your point without a stern parent asking you to leave the table.,For at least a decade, Dr. Michael Persinger handed out a waiver to his first-year psychology students to make them aware of the offensive terms and phrases he would be using in class.,Granted, the document has the legal foundations of a pinky swear. But that’s not the point.,The waiver provides students an early chance to switch to another section if they prefer to avoid its subject matter.  But it doesn’t call them oversensitive or suggests they lighten up should they decline. It simply leaves the decision as to whether or not those words are too offensive up to the student.,The suggestion that a university student isn’t up to that choice is counterintuitive to the idea of education. University is a place to grow.,Students should be free to decide how they’ll challenge themselves. The University taking over this responsibility is a disservice to the students’ growth.,As for the course content, Persinger makes a compelling case. Arguments aren’t always polite. We live in a time of Donald Trump, of offensive rhetoric and biased appeals to emotion. The course can prepare students for the offensive exchanges that punctuate daily conversation.,So far, the willing students that took Persinger’s sections have been supportive. Persinger won the TVO Best Lecturer Award in 2007 and students have called for his return to the section. Persinger’s teaching ability isn’t in question.,Moreover, the grounds for Persinger’s removal are shaky. It’s hard to believe that if this waiver is a significant enough issue to remove him from the course, it took over a decade before the administration even noticed.,According to an internal grievance filed by the university faculty association, it was a member of the administration, a former dean, who suggested Persinger start using the form more than a decade ago.,This removal follows a longstanding and strained relationship between Persinger and the administration. But, students should decide the value of a professor’s lesson — not an administration concerned about controversial professors.,Nick is one of The Journal’s Features Editors.

But there’s something very wrong when a girl walking alone is afraid for her safety. ,The issue of street harassment generall has two sides to it — what’s illegal and what isn’t. Having someone follow you home, for instance, would justify calling the police, but someone yelling ,“I want to fuck you” wouldn’t. ,The problem is that harassment is so normalized that even when an incident falls within the range of a criminal offence, it often goes unreported. ,Many people are unaware of where the line lies between criminal harassment and someone being offensive, which means serious incidents get lumped in with everyday occurrences of harassment and are then shrugged off. ,But none of us should be shrugging any of this off.,When behaviour is only considered unethical when it’s illegal, a lot of unacceptable social conduct slips through the cracks. ,You’d be hard pressed to find a female Queen’s student who hasn’t experienced street harassment. But neither Kingston Police nor Campus Security have clear records on how many incidents of street harassment have occurred.,Whether it’s to the police or Campus Security, we should be reporting harassment more, because until there are numbers, there isn’t a problem. ,However, we often place too much of the onus on victims to report or stand up to perpetrators. When confronted with a group of men at night, or a comment flung out the window of a moving vehicle, there’s only so much one woman can do. ,Instead, the responsibility is on all of us. When you see it happen, or are told after the fact, don’t stand by. Be aware and active in not letting unacceptable behaviour pass unremarked. ,The acceptance of street harassment is a cultural norm, making it difficult to identify, let alone correct. ,And it’s naïve to say we can entirely educate it out of people. An environment where men feel entitled and even pressured to harass female passersby is the product of deeply-rooted social conceptions of femininity and hypermasculinity that should be questioned by both genders. ,But gradually we can build a culture where people are more conscious of the consequences of what they do or say. ,A culture where, hopefully,  it’s not okay to harass a girl walking down the street. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Why we need humour","url":"/story/2015-12-03/editorials/why-we-need-humour/","date":"December 3, 2015","content":"We’ve become so preoccupied with being politically correct, we’re forgetting to laugh. ,With the internet as their mouthpiece, I see self-proclaimed social justice warriors forbidding people from making jokes about certain topics. Hot button issues of race, gender, sexuality and religion are sacred and no one is allowed to breathe a word of parody.,My question is: why is it wrong to crack a joke?,Maybe I’ve found I have to be more careful not to offend because I’m cooped up on a university campus, but I find that “social justice” is becoming synonymous with “moral superiority”. Dialogues on race, gender and poverty are becoming increasingly accusatory, aggressive and confrontational. ,I find it ironic that people are deciding to fight hate with hate, because it makes it harder for the dialogue to be inclusive. The intensity of a sociopolitical dialogue can end up deterring the exact audience who should be a part of the conversation.,A part of having an open mind is being open to humour and what it has to offer. To dismiss a topic as untouchable is as ignorant as the ignorant people you’re trying to keep away from spreading hateful opinions.,Instead of trying to create “safe spaces” — initiatives that shelter us from a dissenting opinion — we should direct our time and energy to ways to outwardly address hate with humour. ,People don’t realize just how powerful a tool humour is. It doesn’t make sense to exclude it from conversation. ,Jokes can relieve tension, and sophisticatedly use irony to show how a situation can contradict itself in a humourous light.,Humour can bring people together who otherwise have nothing in common. When you’re offended by a joke, it’s not the joke you have a problem with, it’s the people you’re talking to.,There’s a difference between tasteless humour that substitutes shock value for substance and a brazen joke that pushes the envelope. The difficulty of balancing what’s considered edgy and what’s inappropriate is exactly the reason why it’s impressive to be funny.,But, if you’re already tripping over the red tape of what is considered politically correct, you might as well make a silly dance out of it. ,Mikayla is one of The Journal’s Assistant News Editors.

So why are we trying to act like it? ,In 2014, Queen’s received $900,000 through the provincial government’s $20-million program to bolster entrepreneurship. According to the Honourable Reza Moridi, Minister of Research and Innovation at the time, youths’ “innovative spirit will build Ontario’s future,” and the government’s investment will allow that to happen. ,A recent investigation by the Globe and Mail, however, highlighted the difficulty that universities experience in designing and delivering effective entrepreneurship programs. For instance, there was disagreement over the criteria for funding, which meant some universities’ proposals received drastically different scores from reviewers.,Beyond vague and optimistic statements about the power of innovation, there doesn’t appear to be a clear and consistent understanding of what the objective of this funding is.,And without clear guidelines, there’s a risk of money not going where it’s needed. For instance, with the Queen’s program, reviewers disagreed over how much of the grant should be allocated to students’ living costs. ,Investing in entrepreneurship at the university level is a good idea on paper. For students facing an increasingly competitive job market, the possibility of making a job for yourself out of your passion is immensely attractive. And many of the groups that receive funding have legitimately good ideas that create jobs and opportunities. ,But post-secondary programs shouldn’t focus on funding one-off start-ups, but instead on how to teach students the technical skills to succeed. In other words, educating them. ,The reality is that for students just starting out, working in start-ups is very unstable. Eventually, when government support dies out, students who haven’t learned how to do business independently will be left hanging. ,Undoubtedly, innovation is vital. But, because of the way the government allocates funds, opportunities for entrepreneurship programs only arise in selective areas. For instance, the Queen’s Innovation Connector runs programs that are open to all students, but those outside of programs that aleady teach entrepreneurial skills, such as Engineering and Commerce, are rarely encouraged to apply. ,This is unfortunate when we consider how one of the most important criteria of a publicly-funded educational program should be inclusivity. ,Queen’s already has an option for students to pursue a business certificate along with their degree. If expanded, this program could benefit many more students per amount invested than a highly-selective and exclusive entrepreneurship program. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Travel points won’t fly","url":"/story/2015-11-05/editorials/travel-points-wont-fly/","date":"November 6, 2015","content":"The new scheme to pay off student debt with travel points is more of an opportunity for politicians to pat each other on the back then to combat the financial burden. ,Employment and Social Development Canada got the go ahead from the Conservatives to work out a deal with Higher Ed Points, a private company, to allow students to put reward points towards tuition and loan payments.,The thought of corporations capitalizing off of students’ desperate financial troubles is discomforting.,Companies offer reward points to encourage consumers to spend more money. To redeem a significant portion of money to pay off tuition or debt, a student, who’s already strapped for cash, would have to spend thousands of dollars.,It’s no wonder the company is so eager to put forward this deal. It takes 35,000 Aeroplan points, which requires spending a significant amount of money, to repay $250 of debt. ,People who have a lot of debt usually don’t have a lot of disposable income. Those who rack up travel points also might not overlap with those who are in debt. ,After all, the biggest expenses that put students into financial stress don’t accrue points. Students aren’t going into debt due to groceries or clothes shopping. It’s expenses like tuition, rent and textbooks that are the real strain.  ,Anything that helps students pay off debt is good, but trading reward points for loan repayments doesn’t fix the problem, it simply makes a good headline. ,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Wesleyan’s budget cuts miss the mark ","url":"/story/2015-10-30/editorials/wesleyans-budget-cuts-miss-the-mark/","date":"October 30, 2015","content":"In a superbly bureaucratic and short-sighted move, Wesleyan University’s student government is cutting off their student newspaper at the knees without even the decency of saying why.,The Wesleyan Argus, an undergraduate student newspaper that’s published since 1868, will lose a dramatic amount of their funding due to a resolution passed by their student government last Sunday.,This decision follows the publishing of a controversial op-ed in September that criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. ,The student government cited the reduction of paper waste, and a desire to give more attention to other publications, as the reasons for reallocating over half of The Argus’ current budget. This funding will instead be distributed among other publications based on their popularity on social media. ,When this decision follows so closely after an op-ed that sparked outrage and demands among activists for action by the student government, it’s hard to believe that this budget cut has nothing to do with the article. ,Putting aside the obvious flaws of the opinion, disagreeing with the views of one staff writer is no reason to take action against the entire publication.,Everyone benefits from having a space where facts and opinions can be freely expressed and circulated without the fear of threats. When those opinions are wrong we can openly decide their illegitimacy, instead of surreptitiously avoiding the topic altogether. ,But making funding dependent on popularity mistakes the entire purpose of a student newspaper, which is a place that’s  editorially autonomous from its financial status. ,And if the paper is expected to give more space to a diverse range of staff — which they’ve said they’re committed to doing — the loss in revenue will make it difficult to take on staff from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. ,The student government’s action sets a dangerous precedent. It sends a message that’s far more detrimental than the op-ed itself — that difficult discourse isn’t welcome. If they wanted to straightforwardly make the argument that the op-ed revealed editorial untrustworthiness at The Argus, there would be merit to that discussion. ,But the student government has changed the problem so their resolution fails to address what’s really at stake. ,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Time for Mizzou to step up its game","url":"/story/2015-11-13/editorials/time-for-mizzou-to-step-up-its-game/","date":"November 13, 2015","content":"As the University of Missouri’s president resigns, the university has a chance to straighten out their priorities and face the history they’ve long ignored.,Frustration with the admin’s unresponsiveness towards racist incidents reached a boiling point at Missouri this past week, when the football team — half of whom are black — threatened to boycott unless the university president, Tim Wolfe, resigned.,When rallies and hunger strikes failed to produce change, the prospect of a $1-million forfeit fee forced Wolfe to step down.,A university can’t be held accountable for some of its students’ racist actions. But, institutions, and especially schools, have an indisputable responsibility to ensure they provide safe and non-discriminatory spaces. ,It’s reprehensible that this even requires saying, but this means a safe space for all students, regardless of their race. ,While civil rights should outstrip monetary concerns, the university’s surrender to its football team shows what really talks is money. ,Sadly, this is a common theme at many universities — things only begin to change when it becomes financially profitable to do so. ,So, from the purely financial perspective that seems to be the only thing universities understand, it was, perhaps, unwise to disregard the racist treatment of a minority group that significantly contributes to the $83.7 million revenue the athletic program draws in.  ,Wolfe was brought in from a corporate background to cut costs. So, despite Missouri’s lengthy history of racism, he was unlikely to address anything, no matter its importance to social justice, until it cost the university money.  ,But, as has been proven again and again, a student body’s well-being can’t be measured using the bottom line.,The fact that it took students such measures to evoke a reaction signals a systemic problem that goes deeper than Wolfe’s resignation will fix. ,If there’s a silver lining to be found in all this, it’s that we can no longer take the role of student activism lightly.  ,Collegiate football players work extremely hard in a very competitive environment where they’re often exploited due to their amateur status. ,Despite this, many players risked their hard-won futures to stand up for their peers.

The professor’s work is based on the belief that sexual identity can be changed.,Guy Saffold, special assistant to the president, defended Yarhouse’s visit to concerned students with the claim that, “students will learn to interact with challenging views and to have the intellectual strength to challenge back when something concerns them.”,Essentially, that boils down to a pedagogical strategy of presenting students with what not to think, and then hoping they know the difference. ,Yarhouse’s invitation isn’t surprising, given the school’s covenant with students forbidding sex outside of heterosexual marriage, which recently lost them their Law Society of Upper Canada accreditation.,However, in light of that court battle, it’s strange Trinity Western would host a speaker addressing the student body on the topic of homosexuality, when, at least from the school’s perspective, none of their students are gay. ,Granted, the school is a Christian institution, and it’s understandable that they would choose to invite speakers who supported their religious prerogative. ,But there’s something extremely prejudicial about presenting moral or religious views in the guise of science or medicine. ,Yarhouse isn’t a minister. He’s a professor of psychology. He started the Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity, which clinically analyses sexual identity and offers therapy to clients, “so that their behavior and sexual identity line up with their beliefs and values.” ,He’s published many papers with titles such as “Ex Gays? An Extended Longitudinal Study of Attempted Religiously Mediated Change in Sexual Orientation”.,And Yarhouse’s talk will be on “Understanding Sexual Identity and Gender Dysphoria”. Gender dysphoria is a medical disorder that occurs in someone who doesn’t identify with their biological sex. ,To be clear: homosexuality, bisexuality, being transgender or any other version of sexual or gendered identity isn’t a mental disorder. It doesn’t require diagnosis and treatment.,But, in his invitation to address their student body, there’s an implicit acknowledgment that what he has to say is important enough to go through the expense and the time of having him there. ,Coming to grips with your sexuality can a bewildering experience that may require support. But, clearly, Trinity Western is incapable of providing unprejudiced guidance to its students. ,There are many issues of mental health that students can be susceptible to throughout their university years and beyond — depression, anxiety, ADHD, to name a few. ,Homosexuality isn’t one of them. ,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Laurier statues out of place","url":"/story/2015-10-30/editorials/laurier-statues-out-of-place/","date":"October 30, 2015","content":"Larger than life bronze statues of all 22 prime ministers is a bit much for a country accustomed to avoiding national pride like an ex-wife at a dinner party — there’s just too much history there. ,Wilfrid Laurier University might have to revise its plan to erect statues of the country’s leaders in honour of Canada’s 150th anniversary after receiving considerable backlash. ,The proposed project garnered opposition from many community members who said it sends the wrong message to fill a supposedly inclusive space with images of politicians who passed discriminatory policies against First Nations peoples.  ,Statues are an inherently worshipful form of art. In a country where we vote for parties and their ideologies — and more often vote against what we don’t like than for what we do — placing politicians on pedestals has never been a priority.  ,A lineup of party leaders is hardly representative of Canada’s current identity, nor of its past.

It’s a systemic problem that most employers or institutions can’t tackle at its roots, but they can still work to mitigate its results.,As demonstrated by McMaster and Ryerson, universities have the ability to tackle the implications of this confusing melee of factors.,Despite the varying effectiveness of these schools’ approaches, it’s heartening that they are at the very least acknowledging that a discrepancy exists.,Queen’s, meanwhile, has been silent on this front.,If this gap is occurring with such prevalence at other universities — and in Canada at large — it’s reasonable to extrapolate that it’s happening here as well.,So, while we can’t necessarily figure out the issue by sitting in a room saying “I bet this is why this happens”, not turning a blind eye to the problem is the least a university can do.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Head injuries an issue","url":"/story/2015-11-26/editorials/head-injuries-an-issue/","date":"November 27, 2015","content":"We owe it to student athletes to look out for their health, and battling concussions is a step in the right direction. ,This year, football players at the University of British Columbia wore sensors behind their ears to measure the severity of the hits they received to the head.

Why has the conversation around abortion not grown too?,Apart from the stigma associated with abortion, there’s no shortage of physical barriers to pre-procedures.,Visiting the Women’s Clinic at Kingston General Hospital (KGH) is absolutely terrifying. Located in the dark depths of the building, it features damp hallways and dungeon-like flickering lights to complement the low ceilings.,It’s an absolutely horrific space; any attempt to maintain eye contact is ignored by medical staff and shamefully avoided by other patients. ,No one at the Women’s Clinic offered me mental health advice or told me what to expect from my body — things a soon-to-be mom would be showered with at that point in her pregnancy, should another decision have been made. ,The long wait times for appointment booking and high demand for treatment from the Women’s Clinic at KGH (often upwards of four weeks) adds emotional stress to an already trying experience. ,In my case, it pushed me over the 12 weeks gestation period.

There’s clearly a lack of female interest in the fast-growing field.,As a woman with a passion for technology and a dream to work in the industry, I’m here to give you the inside scoop: programming isn’t an expert game.,When I tell people that I can program or that I want to work in technology, they’re almost always surprised, even impressed.

Men are dominating the industry for no reason, other than that programming is viewed as a scary skill to master and men are statistically more likely to take chances.,But where does this “scary skill” mentality come from? ,The opportunities to learn to program are relatively inaccessible, especially after someone is already in a non-programming career.,At no point in an Ontario education is it required that a student learn the basics of ,computer science.

Within hours, Facebook activated its ‘Safety Check’ feature, allowing those in Paris to let loved ones know they were safe, and provided people with the option to superimpose the French flag on their profile pictures in support, which many did. ,However, while Paris was receiving outpourings of solidarity, the world seemed to have forgotten a similar spate of suicide bombings had taken place in Beirut less than a day prior, claiming 43 lives and leaving hundreds injured. ,As hashtags like #prayforparis and images of the Eiffel Tower peace sign took over Facebook and Twitter, support for Beirut was glaringly missing. ,Beirut’s numerous victims, one of whom, Adel Tormos, sacrificed his life tackling a suicide bomber to save hundreds of others, seemed to warrant few mentions. ,It was only days later that the discussion on social media began to question why Beirut was being ignored, with the blame squarely placed on a lack of coverage.,However, the discrepancy in support for the victims of Beirut also falls on the readership. ,The last time a bombing in Beirut resulted in so many casualties was from a car explosion in 1985. While numerous articles appeared on the Beirut attacks, people wrongfully assumed violence of such magnitude is ever-present in Lebanon, which caused stories on France to immediately get pushed to the forefront. ,By focusing solely on Paris, and coming back to Beirut only once the dust had settled, readers are continuing to promote an imbalance by showing the world that we attribute more value to Western lives than those in the Middle East. ,Until we make a concerted effort to encourage news outlets and social media users to bridge the gap that’s continuing to widen between the Western world and the Middle East, I fear that the situation will only grow worse. ,Anastasiya is one of The Journal’s Copy Editors. She’s doing her PhD in environmental history. , ,Anti-islam only leads to more violence,By Ramna Safeer,In light of the recent horrific terrorist attacks on French soil, global sympathy for Paris hasn’t been the only response. ,Some have chosen to violently fight extremism with hatred against Muslims — isolating hundreds at a time when grieving should be a collective effort.,After the tragic Paris attacks that shook the world last Friday, I received a Facebook message by a girl I hadn’t spoken to in years. ,“You’re Muslim,” it read. “Explain to me what Islam means. I don’t get why people would kill innocent people in the name of Islam.” ,Suddenly, it felt like any ground the Muslim community gained with Canada’s Liberal victory, based on promises to backtrack on anti-Islamic rhetoric, had been lost. ,On Friday, my family was glued to the television screen, hoping the number of civilian deaths would stop rising. Like the rest of the world, my Muslim family prayed for Paris. ,But not long after — less than 48 hours later, in fact — a different kind of news started trickling in and the fear started to settle.,A video on CityNews showed a young, bearded Muslim teen responding to a yard sign in his neighborhood that urged all Muslims to apologize for the Paris attacks. ,A man attempted to push a Muslim woman onto the train tracks of the London Underground. ,The only mosque in Peterborough — which also happens to be the riding of newly elected MP and sole Muslim cabinet member Maryam Monsef — was set on fire Saturday night.,A Muslim woman in Toronto was picking her son from school when she was approached by two men who called her a “terrorist” and told her to “go back to her country”. The men proceeded to tear off her hijab, rob her and punch her.,The list goes on. Somewhere in the larger framework of our society, Muslims are being blamed for the actions of a few, and many times are consequently insulted, if not violently attacked. ,But people seem to forget that the largest percentage of ISIS victims thus far has been in Muslim countries.,The Paris attacks deserve the attention they received. They were brutal attacks by people who don’t understand religion or morality, but are perpetrators of senseless violence. The lives lost in ,Paris deserve to be mourned and remembered, worldwide.,What scares me is what didn’t garner the world’s sympathy — the increasing numbers of attacks on Muslims across the world and here at home.,In the same breath of mourning the Paris attacks, many politicians and members of society have, instead of combatting hate, become hateful themselves. And as the rising tide of assaults against Muslims has shown, this can only lead to more violence. ,Ramna is The Journal’s Arts Editor. She’s a second-year English major., ,It’s Canadian to accept refugees,By Kendra Pierroz,In light of the attacks in Paris, the only correct and responsible decision for Canada as a peacekeeping nation is to continue its plan to provide refuge for 25,000 Syrians from Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. ,Among others, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to delay his Syrian refugee plan, saying the government’s strict adherence  to deadlines and quotas “may affect the safety of our citizens and the security of our country.”,Meanwhile, many U.S. governors have announced that their state will not be accepting any Syrian refugees. ,There’s no reason to fearmilitants hiding within the ranks of refugees. It’s actually easier to access Canada as a short-term international visitor or business person than a heavily-assessed and interviewed refugee. ,Any extremists wanting to cause destruction on Canadian soil are probably already here.,Those worried about the potential risk of radicals hiding within the refugees should be comforted by the security measures of the Canadian Council for Refugees. ,The identities, health, religious affiliations and intentions of refugees coming to Canada are known by officials, which helps minimize the possibility of letting in radicals. ,It may be difficult to accept refugees into Canada, and many would argue that it will pose a strain on our resources. But Canada has a necessary obligation to provide foreign aid to those who need it. ,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it best: “Our focus must be on stopping the people responsible for the terror, and continuing to fight hate by embracing Canadian values.”  ,Mistrust and acts of hatred are not Canadian behaviour. ,To me, Canadians don’t act out in hate, but welcome those taking refuge and help support newcomers once safe on our soil. We set an international example for others to follow. ,Fearing the unknown is natural, but even cautiously opening our doors to fellow humans in need is imperative in times of crisis if we’re to continue to uphold our Canadian values. ,Kendra is one of The Journal’s Photo Editors.

She’s a second-year English major., ,Don't worry, he's on a different level,By Mikayla Wronko,If you’re a student who’s worried about Mark Gerretsen as an MP, I wouldn’t fret. ,Gerretsen’s election will have minimal meaning for students, as his relationship with Kingston’s student population is on a federal level, no longer a municipal one. ,I doubt Gerretsen will bring the happenings of Aberdeen and William this Homecoming to the attention of the House of Commons. To Gerretsen, we’ll be out of sight, out of mind and Queen’s students will be those pesky rascals he once had to deal with.,I understand that being elected MP is a big deal, but Gerretsen campaigning and winning as a Liberal in Kingston isn’t exactly a monumental feat. The Liberals have held the Kingston and the Islands riding for 27 years and the second round of Trudeaumania that happened on the national level certainly didn’t hurt the campaign. ,The Liberals could have put forth a cardboard cut-out of Gerretsen and still potentially won the Kingston and the Islands riding. Saying that campaigning in Kingston as a Liberal is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel is an understatement. ,Though Gerretsen took the election, Nathan Townend, the Green Party candidate, was held back by his membership this election. ,While I don’t necessarily relate ideologically to his politics, having interviewed him and seen him perform at the AMS debate, I think Townend was the most intelligent, capable candidate in this election for Kingston and the Islands.,If Townend were to cross the floor and campaign under a party that holds more than one seat, he could be fantastically competitive in a future election.,Mikayla is one of The Journal’s Assistant News Editors.

Campus polling stations saw 42,000 student votes cast in advanced polling.,This enthusiasm was certainly not lacking in Kingston. ,The political involvement of Queen’s students was a welcome change. ,Despite the drizzly local weather, students walked, bussed and biked to the polls in swarms. ,The subsequent shift in government was dramatic. ,Though the Liberal candidates in the Kingston and the Islands riding have historically been successful, at the national level Canada crossed the spectrum entirely and moved from a majority Conservative government to a Liberal majority.,The 2015 election turnout re-affirmed that the physical act of voting can garner a prominent change in leadership. ,The promise that student votes hold genuine weight to alter the way our country is governed is a necessary and positive reinforcement for democratically responsible action — regardless of where your views align politically.,Victoria is one of The Journal’s Assistant News Editors.

The letter also referred to the same editor’s recent feature, which compared the experience of Israeli Arabs to black South Africans under Apartheid. ,As a student journalist, this editor can’t have been unaware of the politically-charged nature of their remarks on Twitter. ,The division between work and home life doesn’t extend to Twitter or social media platforms.

As a society, we acknowledge that there are harmful attitudes that have no place in discourse and shouldn’t be expressed. ,And sometimes people cite political correctness as oppressing them, when in reality they just want to say distasteful things.,But silence can aid oppression. And when political correctness evolves into vindictive protectionism it can become itself a form of undue censorship.,Political correctness stems from a realization that we, as a society, condemn certain points of view as bigoted, prejudiced or racist. ,But it’s a highly nebulous term and in some cases, is used to censure not only attitudes that are discriminatory, but any opinions that someone might find disagreeable. ,This is especially problematic for students, since classroom discussions often revolve around highly sensitive topics. ,Conversations in classrooms thrive on argument and critical opinions. In an academic world that’s widening its concept of diversity, our viewpoints become increasingly diverse as well.,If we’re really going to have an open discussion about difficult topics, people will inevitably disagree, because we don’t all come from the same backgrounds, have the same worldviews or experience the same amount of privilege. ,The parameters we set on a conversation should be in an effort to understand each other, not end the argument before its even begun.  ,For example, trigger warnings in classrooms are an effort to prepare students and professors to bring up difficult topics — not to stop discussions from happening at all. ,In personal conversations, those parameters depend on you and what you’re willing to discuss.

Not to say it isn’t also rewarding, but the reward isn’t always what’s expected. ,However, the rising rates of STIs which led to AHF’s campaign could be attributed to a number of factors — unprotected sex, drunken hookups, numerous sexual partners — and they all have to do with how we have sex, not necessarily how we go about finding it. ,Using technology to arrange a sexual encounter isn’t shameful in and of itself, but any activity becomes dangerous if its participants don’t understand how to protect themselves. ,Essentially, the problem isn’t dating apps themselves, but how we use them.,What we can take away from reports of increased rates of STIs is that the class where you learned how to put a condom on a banana wasn’t effective enough. ,Negotiating sexual encounters is more complicated these days, but this wouldn’t be so worrisome if we knew how to have sex without getting an STI.,If AHF has sufficient evidence that specific dating apps are the cause of, and not just correlated to, rising rates of venereal disease, then by all means they should fulfill their mandate and alert users to the danger. ,But until that point, their targeting of Tinder and Grindr is more a defamatory shot in the dark than a well-aimed conscientious public service. ,All is not necessarily fair in sex and billboards.  ,— Journal Editorial Board, "},{"title":"Stay ahead when your budget’s in the red","url":"/story/2015-09-28/editorials/stay-ahead-when-your-budgets-in-the-red/","date":"September 29, 2015","content":"In a new and frightening world of budget cuts, CBC must adapt or die.,Last week, CBC announced to staff their potential plans to sell off anywhere from 50 per cent to all of the­­ir properties.,Digging the studio out of a hole created by federal budget cuts and waning public interest by selling off property isn’t a new tactic for the CBC, but it’s probably not the most effective one.,The broadcaster’s hope might be the promises of the Liberal, NDP or Green Party candidates to inject life into the CBC’s federal budget, which under a Conservative government has had its IV cut.,CBC isn’t the only publicly-funded organization to suffer from an oppositional political agenda.

We shouldn’t assume that a younger demographic is any less diverse or multi-faceted in its opinions and concerns than the rest of Canada. ,Nor can older generations hold youth responsible for fixing the political decisions they now regret.  ,If we truly want youth to have an opinion and hold themselves accountable, we have to start acting like we trust them to make the right decision. ,But if the tattoos are the only motivation older generations think we can understand, then we have a lot of work to do. ,In the meantime though, we’ll do our best to drag our lazy, inked selves away from our jobs, schoolwork, unpaid internships, apprenticeships, loan applications and exams to defy your expectations.  ,— Journal Editorial Board, "},{"title":"Confront the closing of Canadian citizenship  ","url":"/story/2015-10-01/editorials/confront-the-closing-of-canadian-citizenship/","date":"October 2, 2015","content":"The burgeoning Canadian identity is something to be concerned about.,In comparison to the political fervour generated by Bill C-51 — the Anti-terrorism Act — Bill C-24 slipped quietly under the radar into legislation on June 20, 2014 and came into effect earlier this year. ,Bill C-24 allows dual citizens to be stripped of their Canadian citizenship if convicted of treason, spying or terrorism, either domestically or in a foreign nation, at the discretion of Canada’s citizenship and immigration minister. ,During the Munk debate on Monday night, Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau clashed over the bill. ,Trudeau said it devalues Canadian citizenship by making it “conditional for anyone”, but Harper asserted that there’s a “minimum bar” immigrants and people coming to Canada should be expected to live up to. ,Bill C-24 is one in an escalating stampede of legislation that undermines the idea of a tolerant, all-accepting, free Canada.,Since the War Measures Act, to reforms following 9/11, and Bill C-51, Canada has acted increasingly defensively by mitigating certain civil rights in the name of national security.,Regardless of your political preferences, the direction of this country concerns all of us who are starting out, or deciding what to do with our lives. ,The concept of losing Canadian citizenship hits close to home for many of us who have dual citizenship, or whose families immigrated to Canada. ,The membership rights incumbent in citizenship obligates lawmakers to consider citizens’ needs and wishes in creating the laws that govern them. ,Maybe there’s a legitimate discussion to be had around how these rights are distributed. ,But, we should be able to have this discussion without being bombarded by prejudicial images of homegrown insurgents to sway our vote. ,Targeting dual citizens — those who came from or whose parents came from other countries — has a discriminatory on those towards whom Harper hasn’t displayed love in the past.  ,It’s a way of filtering Canadian identity to suit a definition we’re comfortable with, but not necessarily one that reflects reality. ,We have a tendency to think of terrorists as foreigners. But committing a terrorist act doesn’t make someone less Canadian. Instead, we’re confronted with a different definition of Canadian.,We can either restrict ourselves to “old-stock” Canada, or embrace the narrative we’ve always been sold about Canadian diversity. ,The Canadian identity currently being formulated is the legacy we will inherit. ,Irrespective of your political allegiances, make sure it’s a national identity that makes you proud to be Canadian.,— Journal Editorial Board, "},{"title":"Educate to rehabilitate ","url":"/story/2015-09-21/editorials/educate-to-rehabilitate/","date":"September 22, 2015","content":"Education shouldn’t be a last ditch effort to save someone from a life of crime — it should be the very first step.  ,In a storyline worthy of Hollywood, three inmates of a maximum-security facility in New York debated their way to victory over Harvard College undergrads on Friday, Sept. 18.,The inmates are members of the Bard Prison Initiative, a privately-funded program that offers a college education to prison inmates in six facilities throughout New York state.,Of the program’s past participants, less than 4 per cent have re-offended upon release.,The success of privately-funded educational rehabilitative programs, such as Bard, provide precedent for instituting similar publically-funded programs.   ,The Bard Prison Initiative is just one more example of the importance of education in crime-prevention.,Repeat offenders pose a troubling issue for prison systems around the world. They signal that the system didn't work, that the punishment was ineffective or even debilitative.,Isolation from society, while touted as a necessary measure for public safety, often leads to a lack of intellectual stimulation and social interaction. Such deprivation can seriously degrade an inmate's ability to integrate and function in society.,Most of these problems can be combated by increasing access to educational rehabilitative programs, which in turn open doors to employment.,A barrier to providing education to prisoners, however, is that inmates are often considered unworthy of receiving an education.,Some crimes are beyond forgiveness, the reasoning goes, and their perpetrators have sacrificed their right to participate in and benefit from public affairs, so why should taxpayers bear the brunt of paying for their education?,But both the interests of public safety and cost effectiveness are served by limiting recidivism rates.,Delaying offenders’access to rehabilitation programs costs Canada an extra $26 million a year, according to Auditor-General Michaels Ferguson. The financial burden of supporting those who’ve been incarcerated far outweighs the cost of providing that education.,Prisoners who demonstrate a willingness to participate in educational programs should have an equal chance to make the best of their lives. ,And there’s both a need for education and a willingness to earn it in Canada.,In Canada, 82 per cent of federal inmates test at a completion level lower than a Grade 12 education when they’re admitted, according to the Correctional Service of Canada.,40 per cent of inmates in Canadian prisons are enrolled in an adult basic education program that covers up to Grade 10.,Approximately 25 percent of inmates take advantage of vocational education, and another 25 per cent participate in secondary education which goes until Grade 12.,Less than 10 per cent pursue post-secondary education, which they pay for themselves.,Correctional Investigator Howard Sapers, stated in his 2012-13 report that “The single largest barrier to effective participation in work and vocational skills programs is not inmate disinterest, but rather the shortage of meaningful work and training opportunities.”,Why wouldn’t we publicly fund the education of those who have demonstrated through their interest in education that they’ll be less likely to re-offend?

This rose to 54 per cent in 2013.,But whereas numbers can often seem cold and calculating, very little is as sobering as knowing my mother was worried for my safety because of something that had happened a country away.,What scares me most is that people don’t seem scared by this. ,When someone feels the need to change a seminal piece of self-identification for the sake of personal safety, we should be afraid of the culture that pushes them to that point. ,Ramna is The Journal’s Arts Editor.

This included the high ratio between current teaching-focused faculty and incoming class sizes, professors’ ability to take a salary cut in return for fewer teaching hours and the exclusion of students from the bargaining process.,It makes sense why universities hire candidates who wish to teach, and who prove skillful at it, to fill the gap left by professors who are research-oriented.,What doesn’t make sense is that they lack job security, are paid less, have fewer benefits and are somehow viewed as inferior to their research-oriented colleagues.,The root of the problem is that there are extremely high incentives for academic research. Discovering new knowledge brings in awards, funding and recognition, both for the professor and the university.,There are few lining up to fund or celebrate a good educator.,Part of this may be because without taking student feedback into consideration, there’s no real way to quantify good teaching.,However, without anyone keeping tabs on what’s happening in the classroom, students can be saddled with a professor who clearly doesn’t want to be there and demonstrates little concern for students’ education.,Queen’s has a remarkable faculty of teachers and researchers. It can’t be that difficult to reward each faculty member equally for doing what they do best.,Another consequence of high incentives for academic research is research misconduct.,In the face of such pressure to produce new research, professors are more likely to violate their academic integrity, and universities are less likely to investigate it.,Meanwhile, PhDs are groomed to produce research and thrown into a classroom with little knowledge of how to work a projector, let alone teach a class.,Some professors are simply better suited to a laboratory than a classroom, but that doesn’t mean those who thrive in a teaching role aren’t a vital part of a university’s objective.,Nor does it matter to the student body if our professors are conducting award-winning research if we don’t see hide or hair of it.,Queen’s is a university, not a think tank, or a R&D department.

But it was also reported in students for reasons such as saving money or expediency in getting drunk to escape stress. ,Undeniably, drinking behaviour among young people is a serious concern.,Consumption of alcohol among university students is often linked with many other serious issues, such as sexual assault, alcoholism and poor mental health. However, symptoms of deeply-rooted problems shouldn’t be mistaken for the problems themselves. ,The issue isn’t that a student suffering from a mental illness might be more likely to eat less in order to drink more, but that they’re suffering from a mental illness in the first place. ,A superficial focus on the sporadic habits of students isn’t a helpful way to talk about drinking cultures on university campuses, nor about the ill effects of suffocating debt and impossibly high workloads. ,By incorporating the name of a serious eating disorder  into a catchy title, it demonstrates the worrisome flippancy many have toward a deeply-entrenched norm of substance abuse.,We’re often too uncomfortable to open that can of worms.

Large numbers of intoxicated students also swarmed the pier and jumped into Lake Ontario. ,Woolf also posted his email on his Twitter account and blog so that they could be viewed by the public at large.  ,While students’ conduct was highly reprehensible, several suggestions made in Woolf’s email weren’t constructive or are downright contradictory. ,Despite admitting that the school has made significant progress since the events of 2005 — which resulted in the five-year cancellation of Homecoming — Woolf can’t help himself from threatening to cancel the event again.  ,Last fall, Woolf hailed the ReUnion Street Festival as a success, and expressed hope that it would become a traditional event that would create a safe Homecoming for students and alumni.  ,But despite his expressed support, the University has not provided any funding for the festival, citing both a tight budget and concern over how funding a street party would be publically perceived.  ,Punishing harmful behaviour by refusing to fund efforts that provide a solution to this behaviour is both counter-productive and potentially detrimental to students and Kingstonians. ,By publishing this email outside of private communication with students, the administration also raises some concerns about whether it prioritizes students’ well-being, or the University’s public image. ,Alongside mentions of taking “pride in this university”, “an embarrassment to … the university as a whole” and “reputational damage,” Woolf referred to the deaths of 2010. This reference is deeply inappropriate in this context. ,Presumably, Woolf is referring to the alcohol-related, accidental deaths of two students at the beginning of the 2010 school year, and not to the later incidents of suicide that raised serious concerns about the school’s mental health services. ,The deaths of six students in 2010 — both alcohol and mental health related — should indicate that there’s a deeper problem at Queen’s than what wagging a finger will fix. ,It’s long past the point where we’ve identified Queen’s drinking culture as a serious problem. Instead of publicly pontificating, the administration should turn its attention to resolutions. ,Drinking at Queen’s is often more than an indulgence. For some students, the culture is so persistent that joining in is an expectation, even an obligation. ,But, the actions of many students — from cleaning up streets and the pier to crowd-funding to repair damages — indicates that students aren’t incapable of behaving properly.  ,If the University is unprepared to meet the challenge of their current student body, their move to increase enrolment should have us all questioning whether this space is prepared for an influx of even more students.,One resolution that Woolf suggests is that senior students exercise leadership. However this expectation is at odds with the University’s constant interference in normally student-led endeavours. ,For example, the Commerce Orientation Week was placed under probation, which set strict hiring restrictions by the University that limited student’s ability to make decisions regarding what’s normally a student-run project. ,Woolf furthermore states that, “we need the entire student body to work together.” But his email has already had a divisive effect, with many upper years taking to social media to blame first years. ,Instead of making first years feel accepted and welcomed, they were given an abrupt initiation into the worst side of Queen’s culture that may have irreparably tainted their relationship to the university, its principal and other students. ,Despite straight A’s for condescension, Woolf’s letter to his student body missed the boat on diplomacy. ,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Exercise democracy","url":"/story/2015-06-01/editorials/exercise-democracy/","date":"June 2, 2015","content":"In the last federal election, it took 6,201 votes to elect a majority Conservative government.

They don’t, however, have the option to apply for a loan from the province if this isn’t enough. ,And in Ontario, anything you’re loaned from the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) beyond $7,300 will be converted into a grant, meaning you don’t have to pay it back. ,With its small student body and desire to swell its working population, a grants-only system makes sense for Newfoundland and Labrador. ,However, for over-burdened Ontario, grants-only may be an unnecessary measure. ,Although unadvertised, OSAP currently offers a fairly generous grant program, the Ontario Student Opportunity Grant. ,For Ontario, it’s more a matter of making the already available assistance more accessible to the students who need it most. ,Reducing student debt means that more students from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds have access to the opportunities incumbent in post-secondary education. ,If each province follows Newfoundland and Labrador’s example to meet the needs of its students equally, there should be no room for crippling student debt. ,— Journal Editorial Board, "},{"title":"Pride over fear","url":"/story/2015-09-17/editorials/pride-over-fear/","date":"September 18, 2015","content":"The University of Toronto administration walked a fine line between ensuring student safety and spreading fear.  ,Last week, Toronto Police began an ongoing investigation into comments on a BlogTO post by the user handle “KillFeminists”that encouraged graphic violence against students in U of T’s women’s studies and sociology departments.,Toronto Police have since discerned “no credible threat”, but security at the school remains alert. There have also been reports of similar threats in June that went unpublicized.,The university initially sent out an email on Sept. 10 notifying students of the threat, but didn’t specify the targeted group. ,This was later followed by an email to women’s and gender studies students to alert them of possible increased security measures.,The day after the second email, U of T’s student newspaper, The Varsity, published an article that quoted students saying that they didn’t think that the university had done enough to ensure their safety.,Among the concerns raised was that the university hadn’t informed the targeted students of the nature of the threat in their initial correspondence, they didn’t discuss an emergency plan and the threat wasn’t taken seriously enough due to its gendered nature. ,It does matter that these threats were directed towards feminists specifically. Violence against advocates of feminism and gender equality is definitely not unheard of at Canadian universities.,Therefore, no university should take shortcuts in ensuring students and staff’s safety, and any information that might prove integral to protecting those vulnerable to attack should be communicated.,But, by extending the spread of hate speech, the university risks assisting the intent of this threat: to scare and intimidate people who stand up for gender equality.,The line that U of T then has to walk is between mitigating risk, and mitigating progress.,It is important to maintain an atmosphere that’s not only safe, but also non-fearful and proud.,President Meric Gertler’s statement of condemnation for the threats is a good example.

Building an international profile is an effective method to reverse this trend. ,Internationalization will bring many Queen’s students into contact with the world, and no amount of textbook readings can do as much to prepare students as actual travel.,But the QUCIP doesn’t include a discussion of exactly how the University intends to bolster student participation in exchange. ,Many students recognize the benefits of going on exchange, but it can be brutally expensive for students already on a tight budget. ,Queen’s currently offers some funding assistance through bursaries and scholarships. However, most require extensive applications and are only offered if the student has already received significant government assistance. ,Sending more students abroad will only be feasible if the University is willing to offer the necessary financial assistance. ,And vice versa: bringing in more international students will require the University to ensure that they can handle a greater influx of students needing extra support.  ,The Queen’s University International Centre (QUIC) offers many useful resources from advising appointments to English language classes to movie nights.,But these resources will be stretched even thinner by increasing international enrolment, and a case-by-case, appointment-based system might not be enough to meet that demand.  ,Queen’s can offer a transformative student learning experience to international students only if incomers can receive assistance with issues ranging from housing to culture shock to proper winter attire. ,Until Queen’s is prepared to update its range of accessible services to integrate international students into the community, the administration should balance progress with diligence. ,This would require more qualitative measures of success, including levels of satisfaction, as opposed to the mostly quantitative measures that the University is currently adopting in the QUCIP. ,Let’s make sure that we’re packing our suitcases with the necessary supplies, and not stuffing them with  plans we can’t fulfill. ,Read the Queen's University Comprehensive International Plan. ,— Journal Editorial Board , "},{"title":"Let's act our age about sex ed","url":"/story/2015-09-14/editorials/lets-act-our-age/","date":"September 15, 2015","content":"Parents and public educators need to play ball before their kids strike out.,The “Parents & Students on strike: one week, no school” Facebook group encouraged parents to dig their heels in against Ontario’s new sex ed curriculum by keeping their children home from school.

But, history isn’t only rooted in truths; it’s also packed with biases and opinions, both past and present.,Video games with a historical background have recently undergone scrutiny, similar to movies that distort historical events.,For example, Assassin’s Creed III is a video game rooted in the events of the American Revolution. The player acts as the game’s main character, a half-Mohawk man fighting for the revolutionaries against the British. ,The protagonist’s allegiance to the revolutionaries has brought this game into the ongoing debate over historical video games. According to most historians, Native Americans largely sided against the revolutionaries and fought with the British in return for the protection of Native lands. ,But historians, like the creators of historical video games, interpret facts to present their own version of the past. Thus, the study of history often produces multiple interpretations of a single event.,For example, Maximilien Robespierre — a leader during the French Revolution — is both celebrated for his virtue and sovereignty, and condemned for the violence of his regime.,Non-conventional methods of learning, like video games, allow players to engage with these deeply-layered topics. ,By having these games readily available, students can be exposed to the bare bones of a given topic, and can then pursue more in-depth study.,At my high school, there were only three options for history classes: Canadian, American or European. ,And while lectures in university cover a wide array of topics, many important moments in history are glossed over. ,During one of my two-hour HIST 122 lectures — that was solely based on revolutions — the French Revolution was discussed for no more than 10 minutes. ,Such pivotal moments in history aren’t merely footnotes.,Instead of frowning upon video games and movies for taking liberties, they can be viewed as springboards — a new opportunity to engage learners of all ages. ,After all, just like a virtual battlefield, history is never neat and clean.,Joseph is The Journal’s Assistant Sports Editor.

However, keep in mind that roommates may have mixed feelings about pets. Also, don’t forget to take the financial expenses of a pet into account. Annual expenses can total over $1,000, including regular health check-ups and necessary equipment. ,This financial burden can sadly lead to surrendering our animal friends or abandoning them altogether. One way for students to test the waters is by fostering an animal. Creating a foster home allows students to make a short-term commitment to see if owning a pet is right for them.,There are several organizations in Kingston that support fostering, including the Kingston Humane Society, Loyal Rescue and many more. Some organizations provide all the necessary supplies such as food or toys, while others will cover just veterinary expenses. ,However, the decision to foster an animal is still not one to be taken lightly. The time commitment is often large, with some animals needing around the clock support. ,The final thing to consider is what happens after graduation. Do you or one of your housemates bring the pet with you? Will your pet play a role in your decision to accept a job abroad?,Many students ultimately make the decision to give away or sell their best friend where a new chapter in their life begins. ,Make sure that you’re adequately informed and prepared before taking on a pet.

Instead, a meeting was scheduled for four days after the AMS made initial contact. This eventually gave the club just three days to make a sensitive decision.,It’s unclear what would have become of the SHRC’s services — including the sale of sexual health products, accompaniment services to abortion procedures and assistance for sexual assault survivors.,Pressing for a quick decision disregards how these services greatly benefit many students.,The AMS could take a more supportive stance if such events arise in future to assist clubs and services in making productive decisions.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Don’t worry, be happy","url":"/story/2015-03-27/editorials/dont-worry-be-happy/","date":"March 27, 2015","content":"My roommate bought a dog last week.,The decision was a long time in the making.

Some turn their focus to other areas of life, seeking reassurance in extracurriculars, jobs or even social and romantic relationships.,Trying out new roles can be a good coping mechanism for those unsure of what the future holds, but we shouldn’t look past the underlying cause of such behaviour.,Take my roommate’s new foray into canine motherhood. After she was complimented on being a good mom to her four-month-old pup, she replied, “Thanks — at least I’m doing one thing right in life.”,It’s clear the backhanded response had more to do with her looming admissions responses than her caretaking skills.,I find it unsettling that so many of us predicate our self-worth on getting into the perfect post-grad program.,Rather than spending our last, glorious weeks at Queen’s reflecting proudly on our accomplishments, we let this uncertainty stain what memories we have left to make.,We should look both backward and forward with positivity, and recognize all the ways our time here has prepared us for what’s ahead.

That alone should be precedent enough for Queen’s to comply with the FIPPA request.,Like any other studies the University conducts, Queen’s owes the public the bare minimum of information.,Security is a vague excuse for denying the FIPPA request.,It’s rare for even extreme animal rights groups to target individual scientists, and the request was filed by well-regarded members of the philosophy department.,If the University is adhering to the Canada Council on Animal Care’s guidelines, then releasing information will change little.,By remaining secretive, it instead makes it seem as though insidious practices are taking place, even if that isn’t the case.,QAD should be commended for seeking out this information, and for attempting to stimulate dialogue on the use of animal testing in university research.,Research that has incorporated animal testing has benefited millions of Canadians.

The Conservative government is undermining this already imperfect ideology — one that focuses on dealing with minorities rather than accepting them.,In Canada, a very small minority of Muslim women wears the niqab and other face coverings. So why is this even an issue?,Perhaps it’s because, as Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau recently pointed out, Harper’s government is using the fear around terrorism to push for legislative changes. One example is Bill C-51 — the “Anti-Terrorism Bill” — which could be discriminatory and promote prejudice towards Muslims and other minorities.,For many people, the words that come to mind when passing judgment on the niqab are: religious conservatism, oppressive, Muslim and, yes, perhaps even “anti-women” — whether this is true or not.,But banning the niqab at citizenship ceremonies would be more “contrary to our own values”, to use Harper’s words, than allowing women to wear the niqab during these proceedings. It undermines the already borderline offensive word that multiculturalism is based on — “tolerance” — as time and time again the Harper government has failed to accept or even accommodate minorities.,With even “tolerance” towards marginalized cultures constantly being chipped away at, the acceptance of these cultures in Canada is a goal that seems more unrealistic by the day.,Mishal is one of the Journal’s Assistant News Editors.

Abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are legal in Canada, but rarely occur; few hospitals and clinics agree to perform them and often only do so to protect the woman’s health, according to the Canadian Federation for Sexual Health.,Manipulating facts to support opinions is something that many ideology-based clubs do, and it can be frustrating and disturbing for some students.,But like any group on campus, Queen’s Alive has the right to function and be ratified by the AMS.,Unless a club promotes hate speech or violates the University’s Code of Conduct, it can’t and shouldn’t be subject to discipline or de-ratification simply because their political or moral opinions make students uncomfortable.,Groups with unconventional opinions stimulate discourse on campus. Shutting them down would only feed into apathy and homogeneity, as students would be discouraged from challenging the norm.,These groups aren’t obligated to tell the whole truth, but as a ratified club, they should be more conscientious of making statements devoid of context.,For anti-abortion groups in particular, presenting misleading information only further alienates individuals and derails any hope of having a productive conversation.,But all groups need a chance to have a proper discussion with the Queen’s community before judgment is passed in the court of public opinion.,If a club refuses to hold themselves to a higher standard, it’s up to students to challenge them to improve and to assess the validity of their information for themselves.,It’s well within a student’s rights to publicly voice their discomfort and concerns, or to take it up through official channels.

This deception counters the fundamentals of journalistic ethics and integrity.,Between the public’s increased unwillingness to pay for news content and the rising competition within the journalism industry, premier publications like the Globe, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have turned to advertorials as a seemingly necessary evil.,Ideally, no one would publish advertorials, but financial pressures are pushing newspapers between a rock and a hard place. If outlets don’t diversify their revenue streams, there won’t be a paper to release every morning.,If news outlets are going to turn to advertorials, they need to be implemented in a manner that doesn’t completely compromise the public’s trust, the integrity of the publication and the reputation of its journalists.,Obvious visual and written distinctions need to be made between native advertisements and news articles online and in print, to mitigate any potential confusion.,Advertorials should be produced by an organization external to a newspaper — but if producing advertorials internally generates substantially more revenue, then news outlets need to draw clear boundaries to avoid cross-contamination between financial and editorial considerations.,No editorial staff members should write advertorials.

It can compel people to travel illegally, which can cause viruses to spread.,The ban has prevented students from West African countries from attending Canadian post-secondary education institutions, despite their admission.,The policy made very little sense to begin with. Canadian residents are allowed to travel back and forth between West African countries and Canada — even healthcare workers helping with the Ebola effort, who have a higher likelihood of carrying the virus. As such, the ban discriminates solely against West African residents.,Until the government lifts the ban, or West African countries are officially deemed Ebola-free, intermediary measures could be introduced to prevent unnecessary discrimination.,Rather than banning students and other residents entirely, visas should be granted on a case-by-case basis after individuals are screened for the virus.

This shows that most students likely aren’t aware of the opportunities.,Diversity is also necessary within Queen’s faculty and teachings.

Some of Queen’s online resources, such as the Campus Accessibility Guide, haven’t been updated since 2006, despite significant changes to the University over the last decade.,The administration puts a great deal of effort in hyping large projects, such as the Isabel Bader Centre and the redevelopment of Richardson Stadium.

Why risk having your name and face accompany a divisive quote online for potential employers to see?,As a reporter, I’ve seen fear reflected in requests for anonymity. A leader of a protest once asked me to omit her name because she was applying to law school, and an immigration rights event organizer refused an interview to “stay off the grid”.,Add in an online mob that descends on people with differing opinions, and it’s hard to believe that anyone talks about politics.,The viciousness of online debates during this year’s ASUS elections ensured that no one but an insular, highly political group of students contributed meaningfully.,Now that social media websites and news sources can instantaneously share information with the masses, those who aim to survive require communications officers and public relations training.,As a result, it’s only the professionals with the training to be controversial that can speak publicly — journalists, politicians and public relations specialists — while the rest are best off if they don’t show up on Google at all.,In 1933, the Arts-Levana-Theology party swept to power in the AMS and banned fraternities after 1,000 students — out of a Queen’s population many times smaller than the current student body — gathered to debate the topic in a general meeting.,Such a politically charged AMS and such tremendous student involvement is unthinkable today. This week’s AMS Annual General Meeting didn’t even meet quorum, set at two per cent of all AMS members.,Our culture could afford to be more forgiving. What a 21-year-old student says today shouldn’t define their lives, and there must be room for second chances.,Otherwise, intelligent voices may be intimidated out of speaking, and we’ll all be the worse for it.,Sebastian is one of the Journal’s Features Editors.

Some involve newer technology and weren’t factored into their own sexual education — but their children are living in a different context and need updated material.,It’s naive to assume that by having this information, students will be more likely to engage in sexual activity. The curriculum is justifiably proactive, which should ensure students receive accurate information from a reliable source and are able to discuss the material in a safe environment.,The new curriculum’s emphasis on teaching consent is an exceptional addition. With sexual assault cropping every day in the media it’s critical that students learn the importance of consent from a young age.,While parental input shouldn’t be entirely discounted, it was adequately considered in the construction of the new curriculum.,Since some parents are strongly opposed, it would be in the best interest of schools to host sessions to inform parents about the new curriculum. This would help them better understand the material and continue education at home.,Particular attention should be paid to ensure that sex-ed teachers are properly trained, so that they’re able to create safe spaces and address any concerns students raise.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Prof-student love ban shouldn’t be absolute","url":"/story/2015-02-11/editorials/prof-student-love-ban-shouldnt-be-absolute/","date":"February 11, 2015","content":"Prohibiting professor-student relationships isn’t necessary when it doesn’t infringe on academic interests.,Last week, Harvard University announced a formal ban on sexual and romantic relationships between professors and all undergraduate students.

The ads displayed a lack of genuine concern for the health and safety of Canadians.,The “facts” presented in the ad — that cannabis use can result in decreased IQ, learning problems and loss of memory in teenagers — were premised on a study that has been widely contested by researchers.,Despite this, the campaign was released because of the strong reaction it received from a focus group of parents, who were described by the interviewers as “generally uninformed regarding marijuana health risks”.,This cherry picked and misleading information preyed on the fears of “uninformed” parents, who understandably wouldn’t be critical of Health Canada as a source of information.,The timing of the campaign can’t be overlooked, with a federal election slated for no later than this October.,Health Canada’s anti-marijuana campaign ran parallel to a Conservative-funded radio campaign that attacked Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau for his endorsement of the legalization of marijuana.,The campaign’s intended audience was parent-age adults — the demographic most likely to vote, but not to use marijuana.,There’s little point in targeting a parent audience unless it’s to explain how to talk to their children about drug use, which the ad didn’t do.,While $7 million isn’t much considering the general costs of widespread ad campaigns, it was $7 million of taxpayer money that did nothing to benefit Canadians. It was instead a gross abuse of power on the part of the Conservative government, as they dipped into the government’s purse to fuel their campaign.,There are far more pressing health and safety issues facing Canadians that an informative campaign could help alleviate, including alcoholism, malnutrition and domestic violence.

Besides their obvious fame, they’ve all been accused or convicted of committing violence against women.,Even if convicted in a court of law, they often aren’t convicted in the court of public opinion — not forever, at least.,It’s easier to forget what they’ve done. After all, Bill Cosby is America’s dad; John Lennon was in the Beatles, an internationally beloved band; Woody Allen directed many of the 20th century’s classic films.,But 27 women have accused Cosby of rape; Lennon admitted in an interview to beating women; Allen was accused of sexual abuse by his ex-stepdaughter.,It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to know the first accusation against Cosby was made in 2000, not 2014. It feels worse to realize he may not remain convicted in the court of public opinion, since we’re all too willing to forgive talented people time and time again.,Think about Woody Allen. Mia and Dylan Farrow brought allegations of abuse back into public consciousness last year, though the world first heard them in 1993. For a few weeks, everyone had an opinion about Woody Allen.,And now he has a television deal with Amazon.,Before I knew anything about Allen’s personal life, I loved watching his films. It’s hard to see your heroes as not only fallible, but despicable.,While I’d love to separate art and artist, I can’t with these men.,It seems that society can, though. The “24-hour news cycle” moves so fast that it’s easy to move on to the next scandal or tragedy. The media is briefly saturated with Woody Allen one day, and the next it’s silent.

Without the tips of these men, my total tips from what was already a dead shift wouldn’t match my daily goal.,A hard lesson I learned while working as a server last summer is that the world of waitressing is frustrating, competitive and unstable.,Tipping your server at least 15 per cent on a meal is a well-known custom. Still, many people only feel obligated to tip a server if they’ve done a great job serving them. This sounds correct in theory, but restaurants and government regulations, unfortunately, have a different idea.,Many people don’t realize that servers work under a different minimum wage system than other workers. In Ontario, a server’s minimum wage is only $9.55 an hour, unlike the $11 an hour wage most other employees receive.,This leaves a significant dent in a server’s wages — especially for those who live off that wage alone.,Assuming that every customer will tip 15 per cent or more isn’t fair to servers who take care of customers who don’t realize they have a lower minimum wage.,Servers aren’t even allowed to keep all their tips. Many restaurants require servers to “tip out” to the bartenders and kitchen staff, which is a nice way to reward their non-serving co-workers for their hard work.,Some restaurants, though, take the tip-out percentage from a server’s overall sales — not from their tips. This means servers have to pay out of pocket if a customer doesn’t tip them.,Watching the two men deny me a tip meant I had to pay out of my own, hard-earned tips in order to compensate for the tip-out I owed. This happened to many of my co-workers as well, creating an uncomfortable, competitive environment between us to serve the customers who do tip.,If your server isn’t great, then it’s fine not to tip a lot — but at least give enough to compensate for their tip-out and the reduction in their wage.

If a situation that isn’t covered in policy arises, the AMS Chief Electoral Officer is mandated to “interpret the policy in a manner consistent with its intentions.”,Election by acclamation has been used in the last three AMS elections where only one team has run — 1983, 1990 and, now, 2015.,But acclamation isn’t in the spirit of the policy. Instead, it prioritizes the best interest of the team involved and omits the input of students.,With an acclamation, the winning team — who will be responsible for student advocacy, services and commissions — is ushered in before students know anything about them, simply because they handed in the right paperwork on time.,The AMS needs to hold a vote of confidence, as ASUS, ComSoc, CESA and ResSoc did last year in uncontested elections. The AMS’s executive election policy should also be updated to explicitly state what to do in the event that only one team runs, rather than leaving the policy up to interpretation.,Whether students have confidence in the single team or not, they deserve the opportunity to voice their opinion.,Voting, even for confidence, establishes accountability in those who are eventually voted in. That accountability isn’t there with an acclamation; voters have no say in who’s selected to run their society.,The AMS didn’t send an email — or any message to all students — announcing the acclamation. Instead, they announced it over Facebook and Twitter, which only their followers could see, and released a press release that, instead of being featured on the front page of their website, was buried in the “Campus News” section.,In lieu of debates, CBW is hosting a pair of public forums — on Monday and Tuesday evenings — to meet with students and discuss future initiatives. These forums weren’t sufficiently advertised in advance.,While it’s problematic that there’s no specific AMS policy to deal with uncontested executive elections, the crux of the issue is that only one team ran in the first place.,AMS Chief Electoral Officer Chris Casher told the Journal last week that the election process was “properly advertised” — but two print advertisements in the Journal, a post on the AMS website and a 26-word announcement in the executive’s December newsletter isn’t nearly enough.,Mass emails, poster campaigns, class talks and messages on TV screens in the Queen’s Centre are all ways the AMS could have better advertised the nomination period — and, perhaps, attracted more than three candidates from over 16,000 undergraduate students.,Without a voting process to let students choose their future executive, CBW has to work even harder to prove they deserve their new roles.,So far, their relationship with the student body has gotten off to a rocky start.,While nominated teams usually release their platform at the very beginning of the campaign period, CBW only released theirs Monday — five days after their acclamation, without any public explanation for the delay.,CBW — whose three members all have experience working for the AMS or a faculty society — should have had their platform ready for release last Friday. Even a brief summary of their primary objectives would have sufficed.,So far, the AMS and CBW have done the absolute bare minimum to engage students.

I said I thought my buddy’s female cousin was hot until she packed a lip of chew.,A girl in the room instantly labelled me a misogynist.,The definition of misogyny is the dislike or hatred of women because they’re women. If the fact that I find girls unattractive for chewing tobacco can be considered misogynistic, then I don’t think we have a clear understanding of the word.,We throw around buzzwords — misogyny, racism, sexism and homophobia — without actually taking the time to consider the situation.,For example, it’s not misogyny to judge a girl’s attractiveness; it’s human nature and it can be shallow, but it’s not misogynistic.,I’ve been called sexist for arguing that I’d never hit a woman because they’re someone’s sister or daughter, and one day, could be somebody’s mother.,I look at violence towards women from a man’s perspective, because I’m a guy. Calling me sexist for trying to personalize a serious issue is a tactic that doesn’t help foster any sense of communication.,Misogyny is a horrible thing, but when we misuse it and other words, we cheapen what they actually mean and make it impossible to discuss them in their proper context.,I think this tossing around of words is especially true at Queen’s. The student body gets easily offended, and is prone to condemning the actions of others without actually taking the time to assess why something is or isn’t wrong to say.,Facebook posts are a great example of this. Posts on pages like Overhead at Queen’s often devolve into an unnecessary cesspool of arguments regarding these topics.,One example is how many students condemned a risqué “Dads, winter isn’t the only thing coming” sign during frosh week in 2013, instead of taking it as the joke it was intended to be.,We’ve become the student body that has cried misogyny or racism. When the time comes for Queen’s students to actually talk about these issues critically, we won’t be able to be-cause we’ve stripped them of all meaning.,Take a second to think next time you want to call someone a misogynist or sexist or racist.

Another professor refused to make an exemption to a “no cellphones in class” rule, despite Weaver explaining her situation.,Once Weaver told her peers she was a mother, she said, they stopped speaking to her.,The unfortunate behaviour of these professors and students speaks to a pervasive prejudice present against young student parents.,The Queen’s community should be proud to have members who are committed to getting an education despite the obstacles of taking care of a child.,Queen’s has resources and bursaries that young parents can use listed on their website, but the majority of the resources, including the Ban Righ Centre, are primarily advertised towards mature students.,The list of resources is also difficult to find, scattered and outdated.,The resources and information relevant to undergraduate parents should be updated, consolidated and centralized both on Queen’s website and in the Ban Righ Centre building.

The policy consolidates all of the resources and information survivors may need in the event of a sexual assault.,How the school will conduct assault investigations remains undetermined.,It’s unfortunate that the policy’s development was only expedited after media coverage shamed the administration for lacking one. But the University made the right call in moving quickly to release a short-term policy to bridge the gap.,Enacting an interim measure is essential in ensuring survivors don’t continue to go without guidance, and to assess what changes should be included in a permanent policy.,The temporary protocol document remains largely inaccessible, though. Save for an article in the Queen’s Gazette — in addition to coverage in the Journal and the Toronto Star — the policy hasn’t been advertised by the University.,Finding a copy of the policy without the direct link requires navigating Queen’s maze of a website. The University made a one-page mind map that’s much more straightforward than the 12-page policy document — but it’s even harder to find online.,The entire document is overwhelming for anyone to read, let alone a traumatized survivor, and the mind map doesn’t provide enough detail about the procedures.,Physical copies of the policy need to be made available around campus — particularly to first-years in residences, where numerous assaults are alleged to have occurred in recent years.,Important inclusions in the policy are the alternative housing and class schedule options for both alleged assailants and survivors during an investigation. It’s critical that when survivors go through the non-criminal system, they don’t bear the brunt of altering their housing and class situation to fulfill “no contact”.,The policy’s inclusion of employees at Queen’s — not only as potential assailants, but survivors — is also a much-needed addition.,It’s good the University is exploring options for anonymous suggestions in the development of the policy, as they should provide as many avenues as possible for students to submit feedback.,The protocol is a good starting point.

The interdisciplinary minor is a part of the university’s efforts to decolonize McGill, by removing the colonial lens that persists in countless academic disciplines.,Indigenous subjects are often tucked into other courses. By creating a distinct program, McGill is formally considering them to be a discipline in their own right, rather than supplementary material whose inclusion is left to a professor’s discretion.,The program’s interdisciplinary nature ensures that while it’s its own discipline, it isn’t separated entirely from other fields of study. It also emphasizes the foundational nature of Indigenous history in Canadian post-secondary education.,McGill’s commitment to preserving and developing fringe academic programs is admirable, as is the strong push the program received from students.,As a university that resides on Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee territory, Queen’s has a particular obligation to ensure Indigenous subjects are a part of its students’ education.,While Queen’s offers an Indigenous Studies minor, and the Four Directions Aboriginal Student Centre has been active on campus, the administration and faculties should do more to move Indigenous education in from the periphery.,Incorporating Indigenous contexts in all disciplines is paramount in decolonizing the academic sphere.,The University should offer such credits starting at the first- or second-year level, to introduce students to these subjects early on. Queen’s should also consider taking a leaf out of McGill’s book by looking for Indigenous professors to teach these courses.,Fringe programs, especially for ethnic studies, are critical for preserving memory and understanding of these cultures. Implementing these programs is important to ensure more Indigenous students seek post-secondary educations and are able to formally learn languages that are a part of their history.,As calls for an inquiry into murdered and missing Aboriginal women persist, it’s clear Indigenous issues continue to be inadequately addressed in Canada.

Of Queen’s students who consume alcohol, 57 per cent reported binge drinking (five or more drinks) in the two weeks leading up to the survey — much higher than the national average of 36 per cent.,1.9 per cent of students reported engaging in sex without either their or someone else’s consent after drinking; 23.9 per cent reported physically injuring themselves and 2.7 per cent reported considering suicide. The 2010 deaths of two Queen’s students were found to be alcohol-related.,A public discomfort surrounds conversations on excessive alcohol consumption — often because comments can come across as moralizing.,But the issue facing students isn’t ethical — it’s one of health and safety.,The Queen’s community has done a good job in promoting mental health education. Conversations around excessive drinking, though, have been neglected.,It’s easier to talk about mental health, in a sense, because there’s nothing to blame but the illness itself. That’s not the case with alcohol.,In a community where 91.8 per cent of students consume alcohol and 34 per cent have reported having “felt so depressed it was difficult to function”, we can’t talk about one without addressing the other.,While the numbers for binge drinking are high, they aren’t necessarily surprising for Queen’s.,Alcohol — and the glorification of excessive drinking — is entrenched in many of Queen’s traditions, such as frosh week and Homecoming.,Queen’s emphasizes being a part of a community. But while alcohol can be a useful social tool for starting friendships and networking, the current culture at Queen’s often pressures students to turn those one or two beers into a consistent binge.,A student-led and University-supported initiative needs to take place — one that not only educates students on how to drink responsibly, but that pressuring others to drink beyond their desires or capacity can be harmful.,This can’t be a one-time campaign or an overloaded one-hour session during Orientation Week.

In 2011, a student reported another course taught by Torcolacci to faculty deans and the Office of the Provost.,All to no avail.,Torcolacci’s reliance on invalid sources, despite continuous student complaints, is inexcusable.,There are merits in discussing common misconceptions, such as prevalent anti-vaccination rhetoric, but only under the clear intention of debunking them. Torcolacci was perpetuating ideas that can cause serious harm.,Fault for the course’s misinformation lies as much with the administration as it does the professor.

This controversy could and should have been prevented years ago.,This scandal isn’t a victory for student advocacy. Vaccinations are on the public’s mind after measles outbreaks began last month in Canada and California. The Health 102 lecture slide tweet — sent by fourth-year student Michael Green, a user with over 1,100 followers — just happened to be composed at the right time.,The University’s lack of proactive measures and failure to react to complaints makes it plausible that similar issues are going unaddressed in many Queen’s courses.,The current teaching assessment system and complaint system needs an overhaul, so that student feedback on course content is taken into serious consideration.,University Student Assessment of Teaching (USAT) forms are often only seen and reviewed by professors. Through greater departmental oversight of the student feedback provided on USATs, standards of education could be better ensured and upheld.,The University has “cyclical program reviews” every seven years to assess its courses.This evaluation should occur more frequently, but the administration can’t regulate every faculty’s courses. This responsibility lies on the individual faculties themselves.,Torcolacci — whose top academic credential is a Master’s degree in sport sociology — has been allowed to teach invalid material to students for years.

With the cost of operating on the rise, Queen’s, like many universities, has sought to increase in size.,By 2016, Queen’s enrolment will increase by approximately 1,500 students — an expansion the University said will be accommodated with the addition of 550 beds in two new residences and a new food outlet on campus.,Queen’s efforts to garner funds are understandable, considering the school’s precarious financial state in recent years. But the absence of a plan to mitigate the inevitable strain expansion will place on student services is worrisome.,Health, Counselling and Disability Services (HCDS) is a critical service that, with only two part-time psychiatrists, is already stretched thin. Mental health is a serious concern at Queen’s; the University needs to be proactive in further supporting HCDS and other services so that students have unrestricted access.,While the addition of two residences was a good move and swiftly executed, 550 new beds can only do so much.

A lot of photos I see posted on social media seem more like a live stream of banal events, rather than fascinating highlights.,It’s hard to resist capturing an experience to show others what you’ve been up to, or have something to look at in retrospect.

The catch? They must have a proven net worth of at least $10 million, and be willing to loan $2 million interest-free to the Bank of Canada.,Putting a price tag on citizenship devalues what it means to be a Canadian and everything that stands for. Citizenship should be reserved as a right and privilege for those born domestically, and for those committed to adopting Canada as their home.,A failed program of a similar ilk, the Immigrant Investor Program (IIP), was jettisoned late last year.,Analysis of the IIP showed little evidence that these foreign investors maintained ties to Canada or promoted positive economic growth. It was also noted in a federal budget that immigrant investors were reporting domestic incomes significantly lower than the Canadian household average — and paid far less tax as a result.,Public opinion dubbed the system a “cash for citizenship” scheme. It placed one-percenters on a fast-track path inaccessible to other immigrants.,Critics were specifically leery about increased residential investment that has caused the price of housing in major cities to soar. This growth is impossible to sustain due to the inability of local incomes to keep pace. Consequently, average Canadians are being priced out of the housing market at an alarming rate.,The government’s revamped investment program tightened up on background checks, shifted the focus to start-up funding and more than doubled the capital requirements.,But these changes seem like mere window dressing designed to hide a deeply flawed and elitist platform.,Foreign investors should be encouraged to settle in Canada — but they should be subject to the same processes as everyone else. The contrary would only bring about a two-tier system where a citizen’s value is intrinsically linked to the depth of their pockets, rather than their civic duty.,In its current state, this program advertises to prospective Canadians that an immigrant’s wealth is their only valued contribution to the country. This notion is diametrically opposed to the cultural mosaic philosophy that champions social and cultural benefits of well-integrated immigrants.,The program is a slight to first-generation Canadians who have spent years paying into the system and navigating immigration bureaucracy. Would-be citizens whose records collect dust awaiting federal approval are forced to look on as opulent backers leap to the front of queue.,What does it say about the value of Canadian citizenship that we would haggle it away to the highest bidder?,VIP treatment should be reserved for the likes of nightclubs, hotels and airlines.

This shone through in the 4,065 total abstentions to six opt-out fees on this year’s ballot — none of which exceeded $1.25.,It was also clear in the amount of “no” votes on non-controversial proposals — including 21.5 per cent disapproval to an $0.08 Queen’s Diabetic Society fee.,The high number of abstentions and “no” votes might indicate a fundamental misunderstanding from voters of what referendums actually are.,Students could be unaware that when they vote “yes” to establishing an opt-out fee, it doesn’t mean they’ll automatically have to pay it. Instead, they’re merely giving a club the opportunity to ask for financial support from students later on, which students are able to decline as they wish.,When a student votes “no” to establishing an opt-out fee, they’re essentially saying the club has no value and shouldn’t exist.,The onus is partially on clubs to advertise themselves and explain their value to students, but MUSE’s staff did more than the average club to promote themselves, by posting on social media, running a campaign in the Queen’s Centre and publishing notices on their website and the AMS’s.,The AMS has made efforts to encourage voter turnout, but the meaning of each type of referendum question should be clarified. This could come in the form of a brief explanation that accompanies email notices and the online ballot.,Another issue with the referendum — one that’s more difficult to address — is that a lot of votes may be based on recognition of keywords.,Advocacy clubs — ones that students may have never heard of, but that contain buzzwords such as “children”, “charity” and “illness” — likely aren’t scrutinized to the same degree as other student organizations. When recognizable, emotionally-charged words aren’t in the club name, students could be more inclined to abstain or vote “no”.,One way to combat this would be to include a short description of each club alongside the referendum question — similar to those provided for faculty society senator and representative candidates.,A brief explanation of what it means to “abstain”, meanwhile, could go a long way to prevent misuse of the option.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Not all art is art","url":"/story/2015-02-04/editorials/not-all-art-is-art/","date":"February 4, 2015","content":"We need to draw the line as to what constitutes art these days.,Last month, people stepped around a plain black glove that was dropped on the floor of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, thinking it was artwork.,Last year, a cleaner in an Italian gallery accidentally threw away an art piece that resembled a trashcan, because she thought it was actual trash.,It’s laughable that both of these incidents happened, but it’s also slightly alarming.,Today’s contemporary artists can throw anything together and call it “art”, whether it’s a garbage can or, potentially, a piece of clothing. But while it’s open to interpretation, we still need to reassess what we consider to be art.,All art should be based on a concrete creative process that viewers can connect to — in either positive or negative ways — so that they can draw meaning from it.,Some pieces of art are meaningless. For me, a piece must have meaning to be considered art, no matter what the creator claims.,I once reviewed an exhibit that consisted of a few shapeless blobs, accompanied by a towel hanging from a stick that was mounted on the wall.,That this was considered art just didn’t make sense to me. I couldn’t connect with it on any level whatsoever; it didn’t evoke anything at all — not even negative feelings.,Just because I didn’t understand it doesn’t mean it wasn’t art — but where to draw that line confuses me.,The creator might have put a lot of hard work in, but the finished product reflected a lack of imagination and passion that should be the mark of every art piece.,Our consideration of art doesn’t prioritize a person’s creative processes coming together to make something artistic. Instead, people seem to be creating art simply because it doesn’t matter what they create — if they call it art, then that’s what it is.,I don’t think that’s how we should be thinking.

Health Canada’s lack of an explanation for the delay isn’t only due to the red-tape mentality of the federal government.,It’s indicative of the general disregard for women’s health in this country, with particular flippancy towards reproductive health and abortion rights.,Access to abortion remains a major issue in Canada. Only 17 per cent of Ontario hospitals provide abortions, while provinces such as P.E.I. remain without a single clinic. New Brunswick only recently struck down legislation requiring women to receive permission from two doctors to have an abortion.,According to the National Abortion Federation (NAF), who represents 80 per cent of Canada’s abortion providers, complications with the use of mifepristone are rare.,NAF has been trying to get the drug approved for years along with many Canadian doctors in order to make abortion more accessible in Canada.,Decades of medical research show the drug is safe.

Reconnecting with friends and trying to meld my international experience with my Canadian identity were more difficult.,Studying in a foreign country is alluring for most students; it was definitely one of my better decisions. But you tend to focus on the experience abroad, not the bigger picture of coming back and applying those cross-cultural skills. Re-integration never crossed my mind as a potential downside.,I’d been warned about reverse culture shock — the process of re-adopting to your home country’s customs — before I left. Outgoing exchange students learn about common symptoms, such as irritability, confusion and disengagement. These feelings are real and more disruptive than one might think.,Things like sharing travel stories or keeping in touch with international friends induce nostalgia, but they can also keep you trapped in the past.,What tends to happen is your exchange becomes a chunk of time separate from your Queen’s studies. There are opportunities to share travel experiences on campus, such as exchange information sessions and Queen’s University International Centre (QUIC) events. But for students who may not have time or aren’t aware of these opportunities, their exchange can feel irrelevant and out of place.,Whether you spent first-year at the BISC or attended a summer course in Venice, your time abroad isn’t something that can be squeezed into a Facebook album or catch-up over coffee. It’s hard to talk about something so foreign and alien to friends back home.,My mind was negotiating a lot of conflicting thoughts when I stepped back onto Canadian soil. I wanted to tell people about my travels, but didn’t want to bore them. I wanted to stay in touch with international friends, but not only to reminisce about the past. I wanted to keep up my French skills, but focus on my schoolwork, too.,Talking to like-minded friends helped ease the transition — we could identify with similar feelings of isolation or restlessness.

For future Homecomings, the AMS is lobbying the University to provide at least $75,000 to fund the festival.,Despite the AMS’s efforts and Principal Daniel Woolf’s verbal support for the festival, the University is refusing to cover any costs.,Queen’s administration set a precedent of paying for Homecoming when they agreed in 2013 to pay the City of Kingston $100,000 annually for three years for extra police costs. The University should also be investing in an event that directly benefits alumni and students.,The best way for Queen’s to deter students and other revelers from attending Homecoming street parties is to support proactive initiatives like the ReUnion festival, which will draw crowds away from Aberdeen St. and promote responsible drinking.,Alumni should have a space to mingle with current students during Homecoming weekend, and the festival fits the bill. Improving the Homecoming experience could encourage alumni to donate to the University.,The AMS covered the majority of the inaugural festival’s costs. While the University provided a significant amount of in-kind support — such as staffing and security — it should also cast its financial support behind this venture.,AMS President Allison Williams said the festival could become self-financing in five years through sponsorship, meaning Queen’s support could only be needed for the short-term.,The University hasn’t given a clear reason why they’re refusing. If it’s due to financial constraints, they could run an advancement campaign to garner funds.,The University has run successful campaigns for capital projects that alumni might never directly benefit from, including the Isabel Bader Centre and the new Richardson Stadium.

He’ll have the largest adjustment when transitioning into his new role, but his experience as the Commerce Society’s current president should assist in engaging students from smaller faculties.,The majority of Team CBW’s platform appears practical and feasible. Just as importantly, it demonstrates a sense of continuity that’s refreshing to see in AMS executive plans.,Their proposed initiatives — such as increasing study spaces around campus, expanding Common Ground’s seating area and hosting housing workshops for students transitioning out of residence — account for the toll that increased enrolment will have on student services, and how minor changes can mitigate this strain.,These smaller projects would help improve the day-to-day lives of students.,CBW is aware of the major issues facing Queen’s. This shines through in their proposal to hire an Educational Campaigns Manager — a position that will focus on widespread campaigning for sexual assault awareness — and to strike a committee that will promote safe discussion spaces.,When the team was asked to list a mistake made by a predecessor that they’ve learned from, Chinniah cited decisions made by the 2005-06 AMS executive to sign over total control of the Queen’s Centre project to the administration.,This response demonstrated an understanding that decisions made by an executive can impact the student body for years beyond their term in office.,Chinniah’s expressed desire to “de-corporatize” the AMS is critical to ensure the executive fulfills their fundamental purpose of advocating for students, rather than acting on behalf of “AMS Inc.”, as he put it.,Conversations around libel and other insurance issues, though necessary, can often alienate students.,CBW’s proposal to provide insurance information packages to AMS clubs is a good way to balance the interests of the University and students. By understanding libel, club leaders will be able to take informed, responsible risks and effectively fulfill their club’s mandate.,Team CBW has a prime opportunity to revitalize town-gown relations in collaboration with Kingston’s new City Council.,Wright successfully spearheaded the AMS’s appeal on electoral district boundary realignment to the Ontario Municipal Board in 2013, which, considering the City’s strong opposition, was no small feat.,Throughout their campaign, Team CBW said they would fervently advocate for student input to be taken into account in the University’s major projects, such as the redevelopment of Richardson Stadium and the Health & Wellness Centre in the PEC.,While we feel confident in the team’s abilities to advocate, they’ve yet to determine specific methods for garnering student opinion, except for surveys.,Team CBW’s platform includes points on Queen’s TV, which, following the platform’s release, was amalgamated into the newly created Studio Q.,As the AMS’s current Campus Services Director, Chinniah was aware of the pending change, but due to confidentiality issues, he said he didn’t tell Beaudry, who wrote the “Service Reviews” section of CBW’s platform. At the very least, this speaks to Chinniah’s integrity, which he maintained despite other interests.,When responding to questions concerning the Underground, CBW’s response that student input needs to be taken into account echoed current Vice-President of Operations Justin Reekie’s during his executive campaign. While student opinion is critical, action needs to be taken by this executive to maximize the space.,While it’s critical an executive efficiently completes as much as they can during their term, they must also consider the best interests of students in years to come.,CBW’s understanding of their place within a larger history — and their plans to implement practical change — makes them ideal student leaders for the coming year.,— Journal Editorial Board,The Journal’s vote of confidence took into consideration Team CBW’s platforms, interviews, public forums and a private questioning period between each candidate and the Journal’s Editorial Board. ,The interview included a list of 10 predetermined questions and open questioning period for over an hour. ,While the private questioning period was taken into account, it was only a small part of a greater process of consideration.

As a result, Canada’s first prime minister is often idealized and celebrated, while the episodes of racism and oppression that occurred throughout his tenure are omitted — in particular, those towards Canada’s Indigenous and Chinese populations.,As a city that resides on Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee territory, Kingston can’t continue to ignore certain parts of Macdonald’s past. Holding a nationalistic celebration of his birthday would effectively exclude members of the population who he mistreated as prime minister.,There’s often a moral dichotomy in how historical figures are viewed; they’re painted and remembered as either heroes or villains. But no political figure has ever been unanimously loved or opposed.,A more holistic, critical understanding of Macdonald as an individual and his impact on history — the good and the bad — is needed, rather than celebrations and denunciations.,Macdonald’s bicentennial is a great opportunity to have an important conversation on how Canada approaches its history — particularly, the subjugation and mistreatment of certain peoples.,For this reason, Macdonald’s birth should still be marked in Kingston, to ensure that we don’t attempt to ignore the darker parts of our history, but instead continue the dialogue.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"University & societies need to encourage female leadership","url":"/story/2015-01-14/editorials/university-and-societies-need-encourage-female-lea/","date":"January 14, 2015","content":"Queen’s administration and student societies can help address the confidence gap that continues to stifle female participation in leadership roles.,Last Friday, the Journal published an opinion piece by contributor Tuba Chishti — chair of the AMS Board of Directors — where she argued that more women should pursue leadership opportunities at Queen’s.,Only 34 per cent of candidates for elected student government positions over the past five years have been women — despite over 55 per cent of students being female. The issue isn’t that women aren’t elected; it’s that they aren’t running in the first place.,Low female participation is a result of socialization from a young age, where girls are conditioned to be more wary of risks than boys. This lack of confidence was expressed in a Hewlett-Packard study, which found that women tend to only apply for promotions if they believe they’ve met 100 per cent of the qualifications, while men often apply when they meet just 60 per cent.,This socialization needs to be addressed while girls are still young, but support and encouragement to pursue leadership roles can also be directed to adult women.,Not all Queen’s societies have low female leadership rates; the past two Engineering Society (EngSoc) presidents, for example, have been women. Campus organizations such as Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) make a particular effort to encourage women to be more confident in their professions.,More societies need to adapt strategies to ensure women feel confident vying for leadership positions. Organizations and mentorship programs for young women need to be established, so that female students have resources and role models they can be inspired by.,Another potential solution is to remove barriers that persist in student government.

The school extended the suspension through the 2014-15 season last June.,All members of the team — except for the two players, who were charged with sexual assault in August — are seeking $4 million for damages they suffered to their reputations.,While initially suspending the team for the 2013-14 season was the right call, the University’s extension of the suspension wasn’t. Throughout the University’s internal investigation, reports continuously framed the entire team within the allegations, rather than just the two individuals who were eventually charged.,Extending the team suspension to cover 2014-15 only further prolonged the association that other, innocent players had with an assault they weren’t involved in.,For the anxiety and social stigma these players have experienced, filing a lawsuit is well within their rights, and support needs to be extended to them.,Assault cases can’t be dealt with on an arbitrary basis.

But because education tends to cater to certain learning styles, it fails to adequately reflect the actual learning abilities of many students, and as a result often punishes exploration and those who learn differently.,Despite this, grades are revered as the ultimate barometer of success, instilling in learners that their self-worth is tied to their grades.,This system isn’t inherently bad, but it needs to better reflect how well students have learned.,While tailoring evaluation methods to every individual student isn’t feasible, slight adjustments to course breakdowns is one way to accommodate diversity in learning styles. If the purpose of a course’s grades is to see how well students have learned the material, they should have at least one opportunity to prove their knowledge through a method they feel comfortable with.,Offering a greater variety of assignments is an example — for instance, auditory learners could have the option to give oral presentations.,Community-based learning should also be incorporated into assessment. Individual tasks are weighted heavily in mark breakdowns, but test-taking and memorization skills aren’t as valuable in the workplace and real life as collaboration and communication.,A more collaborative environment can be fostered in several ways: through class discussions, group activities and student presentations, and through a classroom’s physical space.,Queen’s took steps towards the latter point by opening three active learning classrooms in Ellis Hall last January. Such renovations couldn’t feasibly be done in all classrooms, but professors can revamp their course breakdowns to encourage group interaction.,One-on-one learning and smaller class sizes are cited as the best way to improve personalized education, but due to financial constraints, it isn’t an immediate solution. The majority of Queen’s professors do offer ample office hours — a resource more students need to take advantage of.,Since professors can only do so much to better accommodate students, post-secondary institutions need to encourage the addition of new methods of assessment.,Alterations should be made to the student admittance process as well. Universities could consider personal statements, letters of reference, extracurricular participation and other factors to gain a clearer, comprehensive picture of a student’s abilities.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Safer policy needed","url":"/story/2015-01-09/editorials/safer-policy-needed/","date":"January 9, 2015","content":"New harassment policies and education are needed in the wake of recent events at Dalhousie University.,Thirteen male Dalhousie dentistry students were suspended indefinitely from clinical activities earlier this month after Facebook posts with violent sexual content were leaked.,Some comments contemplated sedating and raping specific female students in their program. The severity of such comments can’t be understated, as they consider taking advantage of a profession to harm others.,Many members of the Dalhousie community aren’t satisfied with the suspension and believe the male students should be expelled.,Half of the program’s male students were involved in the incident, a fact that didn’t surprise Dalhousie’s student union president, who said female dentistry students had previously complained of harassment and preferential treatment of men in the program.,This indicates a much more pervasive root issue, one that a simple expulsion won’t adequately address — although it shouldn’t be taken off the table as a potential punishment down the line.,Immediate expulsion doesn’t ensure that the individuals involved are rehabilitated, so that they don’t continue holding and spreading ideas of criminal actions.,These events need to catalyze serious change at Dalhousie, starting with educating students in gender issues from the moment of their admission.,The formal complaint against the male students was filed by four professors, rather than students. Under Dalhousie’s sexual harassment policy, complainants can’t remain confidential — meaning the accused is aware of who filed the complaint.,Confidentiality needs to be possible in formal complaints to protect individuals from perpetrators, and to increase the likelihood individuals will feel safe coming forward.,It’s to Dalhousie’s administration’s credit that they were meticulous in their investigation, and that they decided to delay dentistry exams to ensure students wouldn’t have to sit next to the individuals who made threatening comments against either them or their fellow classmates.,Such careful thought needs to continue throughout this investigation, and a better system for dealing with future incidents should be established.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Consult with EngSoc, Faculty","url":"/story/2014-11-14/editorials/consult-engsoc-faculty/","date":"November 14, 2014","content":"The Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science's attempts to discourage alcohol-related jacket bars have been poorly executed.,The Faculty has implemented two measures to prevent students from attempting the “Beers on the Pier” bar.

The Faculty’s actions have increased the potential risk, because instead of attempting the bar as a group, students now reportedly go to the pier alone at odd hours.,Consultation with EngSoc is desperately needed before the Faculty does anything else. Setting up police surveillance and banning certain bars from FRECs’ jackets are two steps that were undertaken without the Society’s input, even though EngSoc likely has a much greater influence on the social behaviour of Engineering students than the Faculty.,It’s critical that EngSoc engages itself in the conversation and that the Society establishes a clear public stance on the issue.,The AMS’s campaign against malicious Blue Light activations in 2012 was an example of promoting honest discussions and effectively addressing safety issues.

The province’s current curriculum lacks focus on topics that desperately require attention, such as mental health, LGBT relations, STIs and cyber-bullying.,While parents should be included in the discussion, their input shouldn’t result in the omission of certain content from the curriculum. This would form a system that’s value-based, rather than one objectively formulated by the assessment of experts.,Health education is just as important as any other subject students learn; it should be mandatory for any school that receives public funding. All students need to learn about consent and safety, so they can recognize unhealthy interactions and understand what constitutes abuse.,Students can’t be removed from the curriculum’s development.

But the argument that it contributed to the oppression of French Muslims, while accurate, misses the point.,Few Parisians read Charlie. The magazine has an estimated circulation of 60,000, a tiny number next to its rival satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné, which has a circulation of 500,000. The magazine also struggled financially; it asked for donations in November to help it continue publishing.,Despite its lack of readership or support, the magazine was a symbol of freedom of expression in France. The attack struck a nerve.,The purpose of the magazine isn’t to gently satirize politics. It’s meant to offend and be blasphemous, as its editors regard nothing as sacred and challenge those who do. It’s a left-wing paper with ideological aims, not a laugh-out-loud satirical paper in the style of The Onion.,Stéphane Charbonnier, the slain editor of Charlie, said he aimed to continue mocking Muslims “until Islam became as trivialized as Catholicism.”,This particularly French phenomenon — where papers that mock anybody and anything, often without humour, are tolerated in the name of press freedom — clashes with our cherished values of multiculturalism.,With our sense of political correctness, North American papers are restrained in ways that French and continental European media are not.,We accept self-censorship and the idea that language can actively oppress minority groups. In France, this isn’t a bygone conclusion, and mockery of different religions isn’t as taboo.,This isn’t to say I support Charlie Hebdo. Their satire inflamed anti-immigrant sentiment and resentment towards an Islamic minority, instead of striking at privileged groups. Freedom of speech also means the freedom of the large and powerful to attack those who can’t answer back.,The question, however, is whether the impulse to mercilessly mock all religions should be controlled in the name of diversity.,In Canada, we use the court of public opinion to shame and drive out those we find offensive. In France, gunmen murdered cartoonists for exercising their right to offend — a right we grant legally, but rarely grant in practice.,To those who say “I am not Charlie” and encourage others to do the same, I say don’t worry — we never were.,Sebastian is one of the Journal’s Features Editors. He’s a fourth-year history major.,Don’t ignore #jesuisjuif\nBy Chloe Sobel,In the days following the attack on Charlie Hebdo, thousands of people have proclaimed solidarity with the journalists and police killed, declaring “Je suis Charlie” and “Je suis Ahmed”.,In the days following a linked attack on Jews at Hypercacher — a kosher supermarket in Paris — many of those thousands have remained silent.,It’s a silence I’ve noticed, because I’m not Charlie, nor am I Ahmed. Je suis Juif. And the comparative public disregard of a targeted anti-Semitic attack is a disregard of Jews everywhere.,The explanation for this is disquieting. It’s easy to stand up for the free expression of political satirists and cartoonists, because in defending their free speech, we see ourselves as defending our own.,It’s harder to stand up for a people maligned and persecuted for millennia. In a proudly and infamously secularist society like France — where wearing conspicuous religious symbols in public schools is banned, and widely interpreted as specifically targeting Muslims — it’s harder to stand up for the free practice of religion, if religion is something we see as deserving of mockery.,That’s exactly what the people killed at Hypercacher were doing — practicing their religion. The choice of a kosher supermarket was no accident. The attack was on Jews for simply existing as Jews in public. We would be mistaken to think this is unusual.,In 2012, France’s Jewish population was estimated at 480,000, making it the third-largest in the world behind Israel and the United States. That year, four people were killed in an anti-Semitic shooting at a Jewish school in France — three of them children.,In 2013, 40 per cent of hate crimes in France were against Jews. In 2014, the far-right party National Front won a quarter of the French vote in the European Parliament elections, as did far-right, fascist and neo-Nazi parties in other countries.,This is to say nothing of the popularity of Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, a French comedian convicted of anti-Semitism eight times who has popularized the quenelle, widely seen as an inverted Nazi salute.,Anti-Semitism is rising globally, spurred by increasing public backlash against Israel’s human rights violations mixed with Europe’s historical virulent anti-Semitism. Nothing that happens in France happens in a vacuum, and it’s imperative that the world show solidarity with Jews, just as it has with Charlie.,Je suis Juif. Are you?,Chloe is the Journal’s News Editor. She’s a fifth-year history major and Jewish studies minor.,Free speech doesn’t mean say whatever you want\nBy Leigh Cameron,As someone with a sister living in Paris and a stepmother working for Agence France-Presse, I know the attacks against Charlie Hebdo have placed a lot of strain on my family, and a fear for their safety in my heart.,Many have viewed these attacks as an assault on free speech. But while no one should ever be subjected to violence because of something they’ve printed, journalists shouldn’t print whatever they want in their newspapers under the claim of freedom of speech.,The cartoons published by Charlie were a set of racist generalizations depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad in offensive ways. The right to speak your mind shouldn’t be equated with the right to print racist depictions that mock the values of different groups, as it’s harmful and further leads to discrimination.,Freedom of speech means an ability to question the ways in which we choose to live, but it also means showing our respect for others’ beliefs.,If everyone is allowed the right of free speech, why have many for years continuously condemned an entire community for asking publications to withhold drawings of a religious figure? Why are we publishing racist cartoons, which can’t be responded to by the Muslim community, to question beliefs instead of engaging in an open discussion about why groups hold certain beliefs?,There are better ways to discuss religious beliefs than printing racist cartoons to provoke thought among a population. Satirical cartoons do have a place in media as a way of questioning different actions, but they shouldn’t be used to make general assumptions about a population.,The attack on Charlie was a tragedy that has left all of us in shock, but it can be used as a way to realize how important tolerance is for all religions and how freedom of speech isn’t an excuse for racism and discrimination.,Leigh is one of the Journal’s Copy Editors.

The economic and social hardships and inequality endured by the Aboriginal community is deeply rooted in historical, institutional neglect.,According to a 2013 RCMP investigation, there were roughly 1,200 police-reported murders and cases of missing Aboriginal women from 1980-2012. Yet there still hasn’t been a national inquiry into the murders, and roughly half have been left unsolved.,Canada takes after its older sibling — the United States — by ignoring and neglecting the systemic inequalities plaguing minority populations. The message they’re respectively sending is that black and Aboriginal lives aren’t worth as much as white ones.,While these incidents are classified as black and Aboriginal issues, they aren’t issues that should only concern black and Aboriginal individuals.,We have to learn from Ferguson. On an individual level, Canadians need to recognize that insidious systems of racial oppression exist within our own institutions.,Queen’s campus is relatively quiet in terms of public protest and political controversy. That’s not something students should be proud of.,Although the AMS has a policy of neutrality to not impose political views on the student body as a whole, we need to take individual initiative in supporting political activism.,Queen’s students may not be directly affected by the events in Ferguson and missing Aboriginal women, but maintaining a passive, bystander attitude is unacceptable. Change begins with educating ourselves — by engaging with issues, cultures and populations that wouldn’t ordinarily cross our paths.,It may be more difficult for students to educate themselves at a university that reflects a culture of whiteness. But that doesn’t excuse a lack of initiative in finding resources to learn and take a stand. This education is more than the GPA on your transcript.,The events that have unfolded in Ferguson shouldn’t serve as a cue for white guilt, but rather as an example of the need to take action against institutional oppression.,The only way for change to happen is through mass support — especially from allies who don’t suffer the same neglect.,Jacob is one of the Journal’s Assistant News Editors.

What if I said I wanted to be an editor? Or a medical journalist, a lawyer or an aid worker? What if I said I was trying to figure out what I want to do and that I’m taking English for practical reasons?,Recently, there’s been a lot of coverage by the media concerning the practical use of a humanities degree. English majors have in some ways become the poster child of this predicament, as they’re often seen as a bunch of hipster readers without a practical skill set.,But this stereotype is wrong.,We’re not all snobbish debaters with useless degrees who read too much into things. We’re learning, and we take away practical skills from our seemingly impractical degrees.,One of these is the ability to do close readings — when you read a text slowly, searching for underlying meanings. By learning to close read different documents, we learn to discover biases in a text that aren’t readily apparent on its surface.,This is hardly an impractical skill, when you consider that texts influence the way people think and society runs.,English majors aren’t all unemployed poets. Many of us have particular careers in mind that require intensive reading and writing skills.,Lawyers have to close read laws and cases to effectively argue a case. Scientists, corporations and government officials all need editors, publishers and marketing agents in the production and distribution of their products. All of these professions require the skills developed in an English degree.,Some of us do want to be writers, but what’s wrong with that? Novels and poetry affect the way we see the world, reveal emotions we didn’t know we had and make us laugh until tears fill our eyes. Literature brings these moments to life, and English majors are learning how to write and analyze them.,Next time a person tells you they’re an English major, don’t picture them reading Dickens in a coffee shop with a snobbish look on their face.

All proposed fees passed successfully.,Even though 34.1 per cent is the highest turnout in years, it’s still significantly low.,The relatively high turnout was partially a result of the implementation of a new, user-friendly online voting system. The AMS made noteworthy efforts to encourage students to vote by establishing polling stations and circulating students with iPads around campus — tactics which should,be reused in the coming winter referendum.,But what really drove the vote was the presence of popular fee proposals, such as the Bus-It and SHRC fees. Bus-It, in particular, was central to the AMS’s overall advertising effort for the referendum.,High turnout can’t sustain itself from year to year through similar circumstances. The majority of students are unaware of how critical referendums are to student life and the health of clubs and organizations on campus.,Rather than simply publicizing the referendum dates, the AMS needs to relay to the student body why they should vote in the first place. This could be done in the executive’s monthly video updates or by speaking to classes.,Allowing students to abstain from voting on certain fees this referendum was an effective move. It helps deter the possibility of clubs and publications losing their ability to operate simply because students have never heard of them, and are therefore inclined to automatically vote “no”.,The AMS made good use of the referendum by posing a plebiscite question on the Homecoming ReUnion Street Festival.

It can ensure rapists are punished and potentially removed from campus sooner, while the court system is generally a drawn-out affair.,But survivors shouldn’t have to trade off severity of punishment for a swifter process.,Universities like Brown are offering victims a streamlined process, but they're misrepresenting the results, as don’t have the same judicial power of a court to punish.,The relationship between police and universities is ambiguous and often seem mutually exclusive. A clear partnership needs to be formed between police and universities to ensure have the same type of judicial process.,It’s understandable why Sclove named her rapist, but in doing so she’s taken attention away from Brown’s alleged mishandling of her case.,Although many recent incidents have been focused in the United States, the same standards need to be applied to Queen’s, where the proceedings for sexual assault cases are unclear.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Name change, game change","url":"/story/2014-10-09/editorials/name-change-game-change/","date":"October 9, 2014","content":"The city of Seattle’s re-designation of Columbus Day as Indigenous People’s Day is a step in the right direction, but it can’t be the last step.,Christopher Columbus was a homicidal, ruthless tyrant who should be condemned for his brutality, rather than celebrated.,The majority of people may feel indifferent to this name change, but this week’s decision acts as an important validation of the suffering of Native Americans.

Both groups faced brutality, making this a victory for the Indigenous people of Canada, as well.,Indigenous issues are far more prominent in Canada than in the U.S. Canada doesn’t necessarily have an equivalent re-designation that could take place, but it’s important to reflect on this change and to see what changes our own nation can make, semantically or otherwise.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"You go, Chicago","url":"/story/2014-10-08/editorials/you-go-chicago/","date":"October 8, 2014","content":"The University of Chicago’s plan to increase the economic diversity of its undergraduate population helps establish equal opportunities for students of all economic backgrounds.,The plan eliminates loans, guarantees paid summer internships, forgoes application fees and provides additional support for students who require financial assistance.,Chicago’s tuition rate for the 2014-15 school year is $64,253. That’s an annual price tag that can easily drive low-income students into a decade of debt, and dissuade many from even applying.,This plan provides Chicago with the opportunity to house incredibly talented individuals that might have otherwise chosen universities of a lower standing due to financial constraints.,The plan’s focus on providing grants rather than loans is a favourable trade-off that’ll help alleviate the dark cloud of stress that loans create.,Most financial aid programs require students in financial need to hold a job while they attend school. By dismissing this requirement, low-income students at Chicago will be able to dedicate more of their energy towards their education.,This plan has greater implications for the city of Chicago, which is known for its segregated communities. While the University of Chicago’s old model perpetuated disparities in wealth, this new plan has the opportunity to address them.,But the economic disparity present at the University of Chicago can’t simply be addressed at the post-secondary level. It’s a result of years of disadvantage that students experience from kindergarten onwards. Similar initiatives to the Chicago plan need to be carried out at the beginning of the education system.,Whether a no-loan policy should or can be implemented in Canadian schools is questionable. Although tuition issues are present in Canada, they don’t compare to those in the United States.

Do you believe in a God who wants to have a personal relationship with you, or a God who turned his back on humanity after creating it?,Looking at the alarming state that the world is currently in, with growing inequalities, war, terrorism and spreading diseases, what do you believe about the nature of human beings? Are we inherently good or bad? Will fair judgment ever be able to make right all the wrongdoings?,Is there more to Jesus Christ than the sickly man on the cross we were exposed to as kids on Easter? What was his message and does it still apply to us today? Students need to be thinking about questions like these.,A lot of the time, people use tolerance as an excuse to not have an opinion. In Canada, we pat ourselves on the back for being accepting and tolerant of all belief systems, but saying you accept all religions isn’t a worldview.,Bringing up these topics may seem awkward and intimate. People shy away from these questions in fear of potential disagreement or fear of saying something wrong.,Many times people say that their goal in life is to achieve happiness, but happiness is fleeting and as much as we try to fight it, bad things happen that are out of our control.

Despite this, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell didn’t rebuke Rice until July, in the form of a two-game suspension.,It was only following a month of immense criticism that Goodell introduced a new NFL domestic violence policy, where players are given a six-game suspension without pay for a first offence and a second offence earns an indefinite ban.,This policy is inadequate. All it does is increase the number of games a player has to miss if they’re found responsible for sexual and physical misconduct — if they’re found responsible at all.,It wasn’t until September — when explicit footage of Rice physically abusing his fiancée emerged — that the Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice’s contract.,The NFL’s inaction is by no means unique to Rice’s case. When Peterson was indicted on child abuse charges in September, the Minnesota Vikings responded by deactivating the running back for one game — then reinstating him. He was then barred from the team indefinitely two days later.,Time and time again, Goodell and the NFL have had the opportunity to be proactive in punishing their players’ misconduct. Instead, any disciplinary action has been the result of immense pressure by the public.,The NO MORE PSAs alone are inadequate. Awareness of domestic violence is important, but PSAs aren’t what’s needed to reform the NFL.,If NFL owners genuinely wish to challenge domestic violence, stronger league policies need to be implemented and individual teams need to take greater disciplinary initiative.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Nix the make-up call","url":"/story/2014-10-03/editorials/nix-make-call/","date":"October 3, 2014","content":"Ever heard of a make-up call in sports?,Florida State University (FSU) Seminoles quarterback Jameis Winston was suspended for the team’s game on Sept. 20 for yelling “Fuck her right in the pussy” — a line from a viral video — in the middle of FSU’s student union.,That’s the epitome of a make-up call.,After all, Winston wasn’t suspended for a single game during the 2013 season after being accused of sexual assault. Hell, he even won the Heisman Trophy and led FSU to the national title.,It’s disturbing he was allowed to start for the Seminoles last year. While he was never charged with any crime related to the alleged assault, there still should have been some form of discipline.,Instead, his skill outweighed the negative aspects. Suspending him after the allegations were made would have cost him his Heisman and the Seminoles their championship, a pair of feathers in FSU’s cap.,One year later, he was suspended for something that’s negligible. As university students, we’ve probably all said stupid things in public that don’t merit punishment.,If the justification for FSU’s decision is that Winston damaged the school’s reputation, surely he should have been suspended in 2013.,Winston is the face of the Seminoles’ athletic program as its star football player and a talented baseball player. FSU once made him untouchable; now, they’re suddenly holding him to a higher standard than any other student.,It’s misleading to make it seem as if this suspension has anything to do with what he yelled. Winston is being punished because the school didn’t discipline him when he did something legitimately wrong.,It’s a larger problem affecting sports right now: organizations screw up and then resort to making pitiful make-up calls, often as a result of pressure from outside sources.,Look at how the NFL recently handled two high-profile domestic violence cases. Ray Rice was originally suspended for two games for knocking out his then-fiancée in an Atlantic City elevator in February. Adrian Peterson, meanwhile, was only slated to miss one game after being accused of child abuse. Both have since been banned indefinitely.,Like FSU’s handling of Winston, the athlete’s skill level was too strong to warrant a long suspension in both situations — until public pressure came in.,The onus is on FSU and the NFL — and sports leagues in general — to realize that make-up calls don’t solve problems.

The public had no idea that he’d been suffering from severe depression — he was silent about it for seemingly his whole life.,When celebrities who haven’t publicly shown symptoms pass away due to complications with mental illness, the media often sympathizes appropriately.,However, when celebrities like Bynes exhibit abnormal behaviour, the media tends to twist their serious condition into a joke, often despite being well aware of their illness.,The fact that Amanda Bynes isn’t “quiet” about her mental illness has given the media a sense of entitlement to exploit her story. This belittles her condition and disregards the fact that she’s undergoing a serious struggle with her health.,This light-hearted treatment of mental illness is destructive.

You then drop the interest or passion that originally sparked your initiative to take on a certain goal.,People had always cautioned me that I would eventually burn out.

Through this policy, the AMS has taken strides to simultaneously fulfill both aspects.,Many students enter university with little to no work experience and are trapped in a vicious need-experience-to-get-experience cycle. The AMS hiring policy allows individuals with untapped potential and talent — who might otherwise be overlooked due to inexperience — to learn valuable skills and to gain the background needed to apply to other jobs in the future.,By judging students based on their skills rather than their resume, the policy makes work opportunities more accessible to students.,As part of the policy, AMS services are only allowed to rehire 25 per cent of employees from the previous year, though staff can be rehired at the same service in a different position.,The high turnover ensures that a large number of students are able to gain experience and helps to break down the perception that the AMS is an exclusive clique.,Some criticism of the 25 per cent cap has centred on its effect on the quality of service, as the majority of staff each year are new and inexperienced. Students need to move past this potential dip in service and be willing to accept a little bit of inefficiency as fellow students learn the ropes.,The quality drop at the beginning of the year should be remedied through thorough, hands-on training regimens.,That said, a standard 25 per cent rehiring limit is low, since not all campus services are the same. Some, such as the AMS IT Office, require staff to have specialized and technical skills from the get go, while others, like Walkhome, need skills that can be learnt on the job.,For the former type of service, a higher annual rehiring cap would be valuable.

Owen, Bryan Paterson and Brenda Slomka.,Downes’ platform is founded on concrete and tangible plans to clean up the City’s Brownfields, implement an effective snow removal system and to improve transit linking Kingston to other cities. His past contributions to the implementation of bike lanes, speed-limit signs and no-smoking by-laws within the city demonstrate his political capability.,His extensive City Council experience can’t be discounted. He’s served as a councilor for two separate districts over 16 years, which speaks to his ability to build bridges — a quality needed for town-gown relations in Kingston.,Downes’ objection to the Kingston district realignment — which would have dissolved Sydenham District and discounted students from the population tally — speaks volumes.,Over the years, he has demonstrated a genuine concern for student issues, equitably viewing students as a part of the whole of Kingston, but also as their own part. With such an approach, town-gown relations under Downes should be improved from the aggravated state Mark Gerretsen will leave them in.,Following a contentious year in City-student relations, it’s critical that students seize the opportunity to vote to cement their presence as Kingston residents.,Downes’ experience, equitable views, sincerity and approachable demeanor make him the best candidate to represent the City.,SCOTT FOSTER,Throughout the electoral period, Foster has demonstrated a dedication and practicality that rivals his fellow candidates.,Foster drafted a 13-page by-law to address poor housing standards in the University District, based on an SGPS report on student housing and existing by-laws in London and North Bay.,The proposed by-law is well researched, comprehensive and demonstrates a willingness on Foster’s part to put in the work.,Due to his lack of experience and following, Foster’s chances of being elected are slim. Despite this, City Council would benefit from his intelligence, dedication and innovative thinking.,It would great to see him involved in municipal politics in some capacity in the future, potentially as a city councilor.,DOROTHY HECTOR,Compared to some candidates, Hector has an exceptional amount of experience and an unyielding approach that could make her an effective leader and a good advocate for Kingston.,However, while her straightforwardness and honesty is in some ways refreshing in municipal politics, her uncooperative manner wouldn’t be ideal in interactions with stakeholders, specifically in regards to matters concerning the student population. A lack of cooperation was a main concern with Gerretsen’s approach.,Hector voted for electoral district realignment, and later apologized during a debate for appearing “anti-downtown”, rather than for voting to dissolve Sydenham District. When asked about this decision, Hector said that her vote was based on what’s been done in other municipalities.,If you’re going to effectively disregard a sixth of Kingston’s population, the reason needs to be more than bandwagon politics.,As mayor, Hector would need to consider and listen to all of the Kingston community. Her actions in the OMB appeal relay a disregard of students, but more importantly, they demonstrate a lack of independent and innovative thinking.,MICHAEL J.M. OWEN,Not much can be said of Owen.,He holds no political experience, doesn’t have a campaign budget and has said that he knows his chances are slim.,Yet his short-lived campaign should be appreciated for its contributions to the municipal conversation. The Third Crossing over Cataraqui River and the potential casino in Kingston are topics that have dominated debates and media coverage of the election.,His presence has highlighted issues that need more reverence paid to them, such as improving accessibility to commercial establishments for peoples with disabilities and the promotion of local farm food, among other issues.,While he won’t be elected, Owen should be appreciated for running to bring neglected issues to light.,BRYAN PATERSON,Paterson would represent the City as a whole quite well. His educational background and experience as a city councilor give him a vital advantage over many of the other candidates.,His economic plans for the City are innovative and demonstrate a practicality that, if implemented, could viably retain and attract business to Kingston.,But his disregard for a sixth of Kingston’s population is where Paterson’s effectiveness as a leader falls short.,Paterson has been inconsistent and disingenuous in responding to student issues. He’s actively opposed the right to effective representation, but has stated that he doesn’t wish to look at the redrawing of district boundaries as divisive — despite its fundamentally divisive nature.,At no time has Paterson apologized for promoting the dissolution of Sydenham District. His inconsistent statements hinge on the hope that students and other residents will forget the OMB appeal.,Paterson has offered no concrete plans to rectify the situation or to improve town-gown relations in general. It’s critical that a mayor concerns his or herself with the unification of their city’s population. Paterson’s actions have only further widened the divide.,BRENDA SLOMKA,Slomka’s presence on City Council would introduce a measure of energy and innovative thinking. She’s sincere, personable and charismatic, and emphasizes cooperation in her work.,Of all the candidates, Slomka has done the most to interact with students, and has voiced her disapproval of electoral boundary redistribution.,While she does demonstrate a sense of innovation, her platform’s vision and principles lack practicality.,A lack of experience and sufficiently concrete ideas should preclude her from the position of mayor, but like Foster, she would be an ideal fit for a councilor position in the future.,— Journal Editorial Board,The Journal’s endorsement took into consideration candidate platforms, interviews, municipal debates and a private questioning period between each candidate and the Journal Editorial Board.

The print coverage by the Globe and the Ottawa Citizen throughout the end of last week was exemplary, as they respectfully covered all facets of the situation.,The Citizen in particular made good use of the print medium following the events. They created a helpful breakdown of what information was known in the days after the shooting, and what questions had yet to be answered.,Particularly commendable was the retroactive focus of many news sources on the life of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, rather than his killer.,Several comparisons were drawn between American and Canadian news coverage in terms of how the latter reacted to the Ottawa shooting. Some sources, including Mother Jones and Globe and Mail columnist John Doyle, remarked that Canadian coverage was much less reactive and frenzied than American coverage of other tragedies.,While the comparison is understandable, American and Canadian coverage function within different contexts. The events at Parliament Hill weren’t a regular occurrence for Canada, while the U.S. faces a systemic issue of gun control. For this reason, comparison between the two should be minimal in such instances.,Social media’s role in disseminating information throughout this type of event can’t be discounted.

It’s past time the joke was laid to rest.,The characterization of certain costumes as “slutty” has enabled oppressive attitudes to infiltrate our thinking about Halloween and women’s fashion in general.,The word “slut” carries an implicit value judgment. The understanding is that someone who wears “slutty” clothing deserves less respect than others, particularly from the person applying the label.,Even tracing the word back to its origins as a name for an unclean or slovenly person, rather than one who is sexually promiscuous, reveals that it has always carried negative connotations.,Some women approach the issue by attempting to reclaim the word and describing their own state of dress as slutty. These remarks are always intended as a form of self-deprecation, where women essentially say, “I’m calling myself a slut before you get the chance because it hurts less if I beat you to the punch.”,Rather than reclaiming or redefining the word, though, this act merely reinforces the dominant understanding of what it is to be “slutty”.,Halloween is meant to be a time when people are free to wear clothing that departs significantly from their “real life” fashion choices. Ideally, this is an opportunity for freedom of self-expression.,Even so, the Halloween season never passes without mention of “slutty nurses,” “slutty police officers” and even the odd “slutty pumpkin”. These ensembles may be more widely accepted on Oct. 31 than other days, but that doesn’t make them immune to the “slutty” label.,Women are expected to try to make themselves desirable by conforming to standards of beauty. But when society grants women the opportunity on occasions like Halloween to fulfill this expectation by wearing revealing clothing, they’re criticized as slutty.,This limits their opportunity for expression and creates a culture of judgment.,It’s hard to imagine that many of us really intend to create such an environment for women.

Misconceptions that label it as impure persist today in certain regions and religions.,However, even when these misconceptions aren’t present, there still exists a shame around the subject.,From a young age, individuals with a uterus often feel uncomfortable talking to others about menstruation. Rather than citing severe menstrual cramping, nausea or other symptoms as grounds for being excused from gym class, for example, many people may instead give an alternative reason.,The discomfort present in these discussions is partially because internal functions, like menstruation, are often characterized as private matters.,While this personal embarrassment has its roots in historical sexism, it speaks to a greater issue within our society on discussing health — one that isn’t exclusive to those who menstruate.,Individuals with or without a uterus shouldn’t feel embarrassed to share health concerns, especially with a health specialist, but the private nature of these issues can often deter people from discussing them publicly.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper has called for the expedition of plans that would bolster laws and police powers in “surveillance, detention and arrest” protocols.,Harper’s opportunistic push for broader intelligence gathering should be met with vigilance.,While his statements are deeply troubling for Canadians who place a high value on civil liberty, they should come as no surprise. Increased surveillance has been a priority for the Harper administration for some time.,In 2012, his Conservative Party put forth Bill C-30, which would have allowed authorities to track an individual’s electronic information without a warrant. The bill was heavily criticized for its title — “Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act” — as no reference to children or internet predators could be found within the document.,Masquerading the bill as something it wasn't transcended dishonesty. It opened the door for emotionally charged statements intended to cover up the bill’s true objective.,In the case of Bill C-30, Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said the opposition could “either stand with us or with the child pornographers.” Toews’ statement was a ridiculous attempt to discredit criticism and skepticism of widespread government surveillance.,Passing policies that infringe on the Canadian citizen’s right to privacy shouldn’t be done on sentimental whims, but through rational discussion and debate.,It would be ludicrous to suggest that the government has no right to surveil citizens under any circumstance. There can be a balance between government surveillance and personal freedoms, but it’s an equilibrium we need to discover carefully.,Authorities already have tools in place to scout and prevent potential threats. Before Martin Couture-Rouleau ran over two soldiers in Quebec last Monday, the RCMP had revoked his passport, preventing him from flying out of the country.,The government’s unwillingness to act further and apply existing emergency detention measures at this juncture has drawn criticism from the Liberal camp.,It raises the question — why is the government pushing for increased security measures when they already have ample jurisdiction that they’re failing to implement?,Given the deeply emotional impact of recent events, it’s far too easy to fall sympathetic to Conservative plans for increased surveillance. Instead, Canadians should harness that very emotion to stand up for their own civil liberties.,If Canada truly wants to show that it’ll never be intimidated, it must withstand measures to constrict personal freedoms in the face of perceived danger.,Alex is one the Journal's Photo Editors.

In 2013, 11.4 per cent of Queen’s students surveyed by Health, Counselling, and Disability Services (HCDS) reported being sexually touched without their consent in the past year. 2.1 per cent reported being sexually penetrated without their consent.,There’s only one reference to sexual assault in Queen’s 14-year-old harassment and discrimination policy — a notice that “sexual assault under the Criminal Code” falls under the University’s definition of sexual harassment.,The creation of a new three-member Complaint Board for each case — the University’s current procedure for handling sexual harassment cases — is an ambiguous and ineffective system. It isn’t clear how the members appointed to these boards are qualified to deal with sexual assault or the specific contents of each case.,The University emphasizes safety services on campus — including blue lights and Walkhome — to prospective students during campus tours.,Despite this semblance of prevention, 46 per cent of female students don’t feel safe in the University District, according to the HCDS survey. The onus is on the University and the City to ensure their population feels safe in their own neighbourhoods.,This fall term, Queen’s launched its first support group for survivors of sexual assault: the Psycho-Educational Group for Survivors of Sexual Assault. This initiative should have been launched years ago, and its current cap of 10 to 12 students is inadequate.,For all its peacocking, the University has demonstrated an unwillingness to be proactive in addressing sexual assault.,Students can press a blue light if they’re being assaulted; they can go to Kingston General Hospital for a rape kit; they can go to the Peer Support Centre (PSC) or HCDS for support or counselling. But they’re never told how or to whom they should formally report an attack.,A clear procedure needs to be established between these services on where survivors should be directed. They shouldn’t be shuffled from resource to resource seemingly at random; this only further deters victims from stepping forward, as they have to relive their trauma over and over.,There exists a major discrepancy in reports of sexual assault between different campus and community organizations. From January to September 2013, Kingston police recorded 31 sexual assaults in Zones 1 and 4, which comprise Queen’s campus and the student housing area.,That year, Campus Security received just one report of sexual assault. The Kingston Sexual Assault Centre estimates that 90 per cent of its clients don’t report their assaults.,Queen’s administration and other campus organizations should be faulted for low and varied reporting rates. It indicates that students don’t feel safe reporting sexual assault.,This discrepancy has only been made worse by ineffective reporting systems. HCDS currently tracks reports on paper, rather than in a computerized database. Paper records are inefficient and insufficient in this technological age. It demonstrates a lack of concern and effort to change.,It’s time for the University to take an active, educational presence on this issue and disseminate knowledge on how members of the Queen’s community can effectively access resources.,Campus organizations should spearhead campaigns that directly engage and educate students — not simple poster campaigns, as HCDS has done in the past five years.,At this time, Queen’s needs to implement a clear, transparent policy for handling sexual assault.,A University panel tasked specifically and explicitly with handling sexual assault cases should be established. The University’s governing bodies, provost and principal must make a public statement to address their dormancy on sexual assault. They’ve passively borne witness to an issue that’s plagued the student body for too long.,Students deserve to feel safe at their university.

Five potential projects were proposed at the event, three of which focused specifically on improving Wallace Hall.,Students are able to vote on which combination of projects should be undertaken through a survey hosted by SurveyMonkey.,The fund that will finance the projects was collected through the Queen’s Student Centre student fee from 2005-09, with the $1.2 million constituting the AMS’s capital contribution to Phase 1 of the Queen’s Centre. According to their agreement with the University, the AMS must spend the fund before April 2015.,This large-scale project won’t address the overall problems facing the JDUC.,The building has failed as a social space due to its uninviting environment. It’s partially a result of an accumulation of small maintenance issues that continue to go unaddressed — poor lighting; unreliable WiFi and phone signals; and faulty vents, windows and power outlets.,The availability of the $1.2 million stems from the University’s failure to deliver on Phases 2 and 3 of the Queen’s Centre. The onus to maintain the JDUC also lies with the University, which has continually overlooked the small defects that have rendered the building inhospitable.,The proposed revitalization projects focus on grandiose transformations of one room or area, but neglect the spaces students frequent most. Most students rarely go into Wallace Hall; while revamping the room may make it more enticing, it would be a poor use of funds, given the JDUC’s shabby overall state.,The current AMS executive was dealt a bad hand. With a deadline to kickstart the revitalization by April 2015, this project would have benefitted from a long-term plan, one that should have been implemented by previous AMS execs — particularly BPP in 2013-14.,It would have been far more appropriate for the AMS to solicit student opinion on how to spend the $1.2 million through a referendum question, rather than through SurveyMonkey.,The AMS’s online survey lacks legitimacy; no measures have been taken to verify if the participants are actually students, and there’s no limit on the number of responses people can submit.,The current survey restricts students to the five proposed projects, without the option of suggesting alternatives. While the AMS has said multiple options could be undertaken concurrently, the estimated cost of each project hasn’t been released, so it’s impossible to tell which projects could be combined.,Both the survey and last Monday’s open house were poorly advertised. No official email was sent out to AMS members informing them of the opportunity to voice their opinion. This severely limits student access to the survey and the details of each potential project.,Greater, legitimate strides need to be taken to gather student input before the AMS continues on with their plans, so that this revitalization adequately reflects the opinion of the student body.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Ops or bust","url":"/story/2014-10-08/editorials/ops-or-bust/","date":"October 8, 2014","content":"From covering news for the Journal last year to being this volume’s Opinions Editor, I’ve had the opportunity to meet a lot of students on this campus.,What I’ve learned about the Queen’s student body is that many of us are well informed, opinionated and intelligent, and we care about issues that concern students and the broader community.,My job as Opinions Editor involves providing a formal platform for those who want to share their thoughts with this community.,My qualms, though, stem from the lack of community participation in the Opinions section.

We’re interested in everything, if it’s opinionated and we believe our readers will find it worth reading.”,She also wrote that the Op-Ed section needs diversity, and that its content doesn’t necessarily have to align with the views presented in Times editorials.,I want to express the same type of standards for opinion pieces in the Journal.,I’m making a call out to the community to contribute if you care about something.

But before we disregard these projects, we need to keep in mind that the type of post-secondary education these schools are attempting to emulate is the one many of us hold dear — perhaps sans helipads.,Recessed in millions of minds is an image of educational nobility, elite brands we carry as part of our identity.,As this traditionally western view continues to grow globally, our attachment to these established archetypes is destroying our ability to think beyond them.,Since an undergraduate education started becoming the standard rather than the exception, it’s become increasingly more difficult for degrees to stand out. But instead of pushing ourselves to break conventions and to differentiate ourselves, we’re spending our energy chasing institutional idols to gain status over others.,As a result, we’re helping to encourage elitism, rather than propel innovation.,Queen’s isn’t doing too well on this front. “Harvard of the North” and “Canadian Ivy” are terms mostly thrown about in jest, though beneath the sarcasm lies a twisted self-proclamation that our school should be held with high regard. We take pride and tradition very seriously, but it’s not apparent what exactly we’re celebrating.,The majority of the traditional academic experience is the consumption of information followed by the occasional assessment of your retention skills. The sad part of it is you can barrel through your degree without developing much as a person.,Simply acquiring information makes you a machine, but being able to create something great out of that information is supposed to be the goal of learning.,Many students miss this point entirely because most universities don’t do a very good job encouraging unconventional thinking. If you’re going to try to quantify what makes a school great, look at how students handle free expression — not just academically, but also socially.,It’s hard to say how China’s new schools will turn out, but what they have is a real opportunity to start fresh and change the way people think about success.

What followed was a gross mishandling of her case by the university.,During the official hearing, which didn’t occur until seven months after the alleged assault, Sulkowicz was asked to draw a diagram of how she was anally raped. Sulkowicz also wasn’t permitted to write her own statement, but instead had to recount the events to an investigator, who she said wrote erroneous notes that were later sent to the administration for review.,Two other women stepped forward after Sulkowicz, claiming to have also been assaulted by the same perpetrator. The alleged attacker was found not guilty and was allowed to continue on at Columbia.,Anyone with the slightest inkling of common sense should know how incredibly inappropriate it is to have a rape victim draw a diagram of how they were raped during a hearing, as it forces them to relive the trauma of the experience. The fact that a university administrator could be so ignorant and insensitive shows there’s something seriously amiss at Columbia.,For her senior visual arts thesis, Sulkowicz has decided to drag her mattress everywhere she goes on campus until her alleged rapist is expelled or leaves the university. Dragging the mattress is meant to represent the emotional weight a rape victim carries with them.,Sulkowicz’s thesis is an incredibly powerful image, and she should be applauded for her bravery in standing up to the school and for calling attention to her situation. At no time did she name her alleged rapist, which is admirable in itself and demonstrates her maturity.,From Sulkowicz’s case, it’s clear that Columbia’s vested interest in protecting their own reputation trumps the well-being of their students.,Columbia’s mishandling of Sulkowixz’s case makes it clear they’re not taking effective steps to address sexual assault, let alone prevent it.,Although Columbia didn’t lead by example, they can act as an example through their cowardice to all universities that now is the time for transforming how sexual assault cases are handled.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Boycott misses mark","url":"/story/2014-09-30/editorials/boycott-misses-mark/","date":"September 30, 2014","content":"Justin Trudeau’s boycott of Sun Media was misguided.,Last week, the Liberal Party leader announced that he’d be boycotting the media conglomerate over an “offensive” Sun News Network segment hosted by Ezra Levant, in which Levant called Trudeau’s father – former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau — “promiscuous” and a “slut” and insulted Trudeau’s mother similarly.,In light of the nature of Levant’s comments, Trudeau’s decision to boycott is understandable to a certain extent.

Humanities graduates have experienced a significant drop in salaries, unlike their peers in business and engineering.,This comes as little surprise. Certain programs, such as engineering, have a clear career path set within their system.,This isn’t the case for humanities degrees, where the only clear path is delving further into academia — a route the majority of students won’t end up pursuing.,Universities need to play a more active role in facilitating the movement of students into the job market. This means updating their program offerings to offer degrees that address the demands and needs of the current market.,For existing degrees, more co-op and internship opportunities should be made available. Universities should also encourage or incentivize students to pursue extra-curricular activities, which can assist in gaining real skills. But, at the end of the day, the onus is on students to take ownership of their futures.,Recessions happen, as do fluctuations in the economy. There’s a reason why humanities students are repeatedly hit the hardest by these turns: their education doesn’t have a clear correlating skill set.,Many students pursue degrees that lead directly to academia, but to do so without a clear idea of what tangible skills they hope to gain from the degree, or what’s to follow. Students must plan for their future while at university, and exercise a certain flexibility afterwards.,In terms of location, this flexibility means going with the job market to other provinces and countries. It may also mean starting in a job that isn’t necessarily desired, developing contacts and networks and then moving on.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Neutrality a necessity","url":"/story/2014-09-26/editorials/neutrality-necessity/","date":"September 26, 2014","content":"Canada’s current national anthem doesn’t accurately represent the standards of equity we should strive towards.,The debate around using gender-neutral language in the national anthem will return to the House of Commons, via a private member’s bill that seeks to change “all thy sons command” to “all of us command”.,Gender-neutral language is something Canadians have been striving towards for decades. From policemen who are now police officers to stewardesses who are now flight attendants, there’s an increasing recognition that language reflects society, and that alterations are necessary if we want our society’s ideals of equity to be mirrored by our words.,A national anthem is something to take pride in, and the current version of “O Canada” is inherently exclusionary.,Voices against the change say it’s pointless, since no one legitimately feels oppressed by the anthem. If you have the opportunity to include everyone, though, why wouldn’t you?,The issue at hand isn’t simply one of gender-inclusivity. The national identity that the anthem presents is inaccurate on several fronts. The image of Canada that’s painted is male-centric — “all thy sons command” — militaristic — “we stand on guard” — and Christian — “God keep our land”. These characteristics might’ve represented Canada’s ideals in years past, but this is no longer the case.,There are far more severe issues of gender, race and oppression within Canada than the status of neutrality of our anthem.,But an anthem isn’t just a symbol — it’s a meaningful symbol. At citizenship ceremonies, new citizens are expected to sing “O Canada”. It’s meant to represent their pride in officially becoming Canadian.,We need an anthem that reflects our ideals and what we hope this nation will strive for — even just as a gesture that shows our country and government care enough about inclusion that we’ll deal with something that is, to many, seemingly benign.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Quest bridges study & recovery","url":"/story/2014-09-26/editorials/quest-bridges-study-and-recovery/","date":"September 26, 2014","content":"The opening of Canada’s first recovery high school is a solid step in creating resources for youth with substance use disorders.,Quest Collegiate and Recovery Centres opened in North Simcoe this month.

The lack of support is only made worse by the pervasive stigma surrounding the disorder, making it difficult for youth to continue in their high school during or following rehabilitation.,While high schools like Quest Collegiate are taking important strides to learn how to better assist youth with such disorders, more support and education on the nature of substance use disorders needs to be present in the average high school, as well.,It’s important to ensure preventative measures are in place to mitigate the number of students who get to the point of needing rehabilitation.,This first recovery high school is an important step for Canada. Prior to Quest Collegiate’s opening, youth who wanted to go to such institutions were forced to go to the United States, where tuition is extremely high.,One of Quest Collegiate’s limitations is that its admittance capacity is set at 50 students.

It would have been far more productive for the orientation leaders to take their concerns directly to the administration.,The shirts not only failed to address the no-swearing policy, but also attacked the concept of safe spaces under a blanket statement.,It’s disturbing that these individuals — who are meant to be representatives of their school and role models to incoming first-years — would act in such an ignorant and immature manner.,It’s concerning that Carleton’s safe space policy is over 10 years old. Universities must properly educate students on topics like safe spaces, and policies should evolve to address new concerns and greater understandings of these issues.,At the end of the day, being a frosh leader is a choice.

The intention behind the new process, according to Goucher’s president, is to reduce bias and to provide equal opportunities, as not all high school students have a laptop or the means to write an admission essay.,This rationale is flawed. If a student is unable to find a way to write an essay in high school — on paper or a free library computer — how are they going to write essays in university?,Overall, having a video as the primary form of application is a poor idea. Transcripts that represent years of work can’t be replaced by a short video, especially when a personal video doesn’t help gauge a student’s ability to perform in university.,Video applications would only exacerbate issues of bias. Putting a face to a name immediately creates an unavoidable inclination within the admissions officer. This would only be worsened by other factors, such as the applicant’s acting ability, attractiveness or race, as well as the quality of the video — which will diverge based on a student’s budget.,If equal opportunity and access to education are Goucher’s major concerns, introducing video applications is a poor means of addressing these systemic issues.,The video has the potential to act as a supplement rather than as a replacement, similarly to Queen’s Personal Statement of Experience essay, which allows for a more well-rounded application. The same can be said of the samples of work applicants submit to Goucher. If these samples were in addition to other papers, the result would be much more reflective of a student’s abilities.,Judging by Goucher’s 16 per cent acceptance rate, the college is likely hoping that more students will apply with the simpler application process.

Upper-level seminars require only a third or fourth-year standing in history, and no prerequisites.,For the most part, we take courses that pique our interest until we leave.,I take issue with this structure, or lack thereof. I appreciate openness in a program. It allows students to explore their interests. However, the current program provides no common base of knowledge, or even a defined way of approaching history.,For a program that values critical thinking skills, it’s hard to justify the arbitrary methods used to teach them. There’s something to be said for learning the basics of studying history — not any specific topic, but the skillset for conducting research and analyzing historical sources.,I went until the middle of my third-year without a clear understanding of how to properly conduct research. I chose a thesis beforehand and searched for information to justify my conclusion. Sometimes the essays worked. Often they didn’t.,Later, I learned to find the available evidence first and test my ideas based on that information. But I can’t name where or when I learned this method, or whether I learned it in a history class. Even now, I feel my methods are haphazard.,Many of my professors have been fantastic, but their primary concern has been teaching students various topics in history, not how to study history.,Most programs have mandatory courses on methodologies. Economics has statistics and econometrics courses. Psychology has research methods courses. Political studies has a political theory course and a political research course.,A required methodology course — a course on history as a field and different approaches to historical writing and research — would provide a knowledge base for all history students.,Other mandatory courses would strengthen the program. A student shouldn’t be able to obtain a history degree without having ever taken a course on a time period before 1800, or get away with taking courses focusing on only one continent.,There’s also the question of prerequisites. Most upper-year seminars have a second-year course on the same topic; making them mandatory would allow seminars to deepen our knowledge on familiar topics, rather than continually restarting the learning process.,History is a challenging field of study — it’s one of the oldest in existence — and proper historical understanding requires a wide base of knowledge.

The faces and bodies of female politicians have continuously been subject to scrutiny, as seen by the extensive criticism Hillary Clinton has faced for not wearing make-up and the sexualisation of Sarah Palin.,For women, there exists the implicit question within politics of whether they belong, and these discussions of appearance seek to find a reason for why they are ill-suited. There are instances in which this has been applied to men. The 1993 attack ads against then-Liberal leader Jean Chrétien that sought to discredit him due to his facial deformity is merely one example.,While most politicians who’ve experienced objectification and criticism for their looks have attempted to steer clear of such discussions, Trudeau is using it to his advantage.,Last November, Trudeau tweeted a link to an invitation for all “ladies” where they could “get to know the future Prime Minister.”,Such incidents make it clear that Trudeau is aware of his physical appeal, and that he’s not above using it to his advantage and allowing it to get in the way of policy discussion.,These instances demonstrate a systemic issue within the voting process.

People took to social media, recounting their favourite Williams movie scenes, wondering how a man with an innate talent for making others laugh could ever think to kill himself.,Several media outlets paid tribute to Williams — the New York Times, the Guardian, Rolling Stone magazine. Even U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement in tribute. On Aug. 24, the MTV Movie Awards paid tribute by displaying a series of eight pictures of Williams, notably happy.,Williams’ long history with depression was virtually disregarded.,Instead, his death became the focal point of public outcry. His life, in turn, was appropriated by the masses and transformed into something it wasn’t: a happy one.,In a statement, Williams’ wife, Susan Schneider, encouraged the public to focus not on his death, “but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions,” and rightfully so. We ought to celebrate the lives of those who’ve passed — for their contributions to others during their brief stay on Earth.,But not paying due attention to Williams’ illness discounts not only his suffering, but also the suffering of others.,By celebrating his achievements alone — by remembering him for how his humour made us feel — we fail to celebrate Williams’ life, a vast majority of which was spent battling severe depression.,We not only turn his life into an empty shadow used to soothe our own disrupt at his death — we implicitly cast Williams’ depression as something not worth mentioning.,As a result, it’s swept under the rug and further ignored.,Efforts to reduce mental health stigma have been widespread over the past few years, but its presence remains evidently strong. So often, those who suffer from depression slink into a character to appease others, to avoid stigma, to avoid others thinking there’s anything wrong with them.,We ought to learn from Williams’ death in order to educate others about depression — not as something inherently negative, but in need of understanding, acceptance and assistance; not as something immediately detectable, but invasive and incapacitating.,As something that shouldn’t be kept hidden.,But in order to learn from it, we need to acknowledge it.,So often we hear about the importance of reducing stigma, but when faced with it, rarely do we follow through.

SGPS President Kevin Wiener told the Journal last week that they were unable to send a SGPS delegate to the meeting, as three members of the five-person SGPS executive are law students who conduct legal work over the summer.,Time conflicts happen, and juggling school and work can be difficult.

That means showing up to significant meetings, or sending a proxy to represent them.,On the surface, the SGPS’ stance is in some ways understandable. The Israel-Palestine conflict is a highly divisive issue and the SGPS can’t necessarily take a stance on behalf of thousands of member students.,However, deciding to distance itself from an issue is just as active of a decision as choosing to vote. Before making this decision, the SGPS should have consulted with their constituents and given them a chance to voice their opinion.,Boycotting Israel may be a contentious topic, but that doesn’t mean organizations should steer clear of it entirely for fear of unrest.,Even if the SGPS executive chose to distance themselves from the BDS vote, they should have at the very least released a statement condemning the bombing of these two universities, as such a statement would send a powerful message to the Canadian government.,Despite the conflict’s divisive nature, the SGPS had an opportunity to unite students — not under a pro-Palestine or pro-Israel banner, but under a love of knowledge and education, which knows no borders. As students of an educational institution, we should be standing in solidarity with our peers on the other side of world who’ve been killed and barred from a fundamental right.,At this stage, what’s most important is for the SGPS to consult their constituents, so that their future actions on this issue are representative of their members rather than their fear of rocking the boat.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Speak loud","url":"/story/2014-09-17/editorials/speak-loud/","date":"September 17, 2014","content":"Every morning when I get up, I go to the bathroom.

But ultimately, the words of allies are hollow unless they follow the voices of people who actually suffer from mental illness.,There are a number of reasons people with mental illnesses don’t talk about their illness. One is that they don’t think mental illness is as valid a health problem as physical ailments. Another is that people seem to think mental illness is temporary.,For many, though, mental illness is a lifelong struggle. Maybe my brain wasn’t wired like this before high school. Maybe it was. But I’ll struggle with anxiety, depression and OCD for the rest of my life — and so will many others with a mental illness.,That is why I’m honest about what I go through.

It’s quality, not quantity, that’s most effective.,It’s time spent in your own head, away from the influences — positive or negative — of others.

Some may be inclined to dismiss bilingualism in the rest of Canada as unnecessary and expensive. Many others, such as myself, feel differently.,You see, my Canada includes both English and French with rights protecting both official languages and branding them equal counterparts in the eyes of Canadians from coast to coast.,As a proud French-Canadian, born and raised in Ottawa to parents originally from Montreal, my experience as a French-Canadian living outside of Quebec is at times frustrating.,Franco-Ontarians, like all other Francophones living outside of Quebec, are often seen as inferior, caught in limbo where they’re not “French” enough in the eyes of Quebecers and still not as Anglophone as the rest of Canada.,This drive towards linguistic purity has created an arbitrary and deep divide among Canadians, perpetuating the false argument that one language or dialect is better than the next. What many Anglophones fail to recognize is the variety of French dialects in Canada.,According to Statistics Canada, more people outside of Quebec reported French as their mother tongue than in Quebec — approximately 1,067,000 in 2011. The census also revealed the geography of French in Canada, whereby 77 per cent of French-speaking Canadians living outside of Quebec reside in Ontario and New Brunswick.,Spanning over just these three provinces, the quality of French and the expressions used vary wildly. The only constant is the language they speak. It should bridge these Canadians together, not tear them apart.,Language is a powerful way to unify a nation. At the same time, it can be divisive to our national identity, pitting French and English speakers, or even French speakers, against each other.,The ability to express myself in French shouldn’t be overshadowed by the place I come from.

The articles themselves can’t by any standard be considered satire, which is meant to criticize an aspect of our reality in order to catalyze change.,The foremost example of satire is A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift, in which he suggests the impoverished Irish sell their babies as food to the rich in order to avoid starvation. Swift’s purpose wasn’t to mock the poor, but to shame the rich for their heartless disregard of the plights of the poor. In their article “So you want to date a teaching assistant”, the Gazette takes no clear stance on the issue, and if anything mocks victims of sexual harassment rather than the perpetrators.,Sexual harassment, drug use and alcoholism are serious issues that students encounter, and shouldn’t be treated in a joking manner.,From Editor-in-Chief Iain Boekhoff’s comments, it’s clear the Gazette believes university newspapers shouldn’t be held to a serious standard. Such statements devalue the potential of student papers to do incredible work.,The Gazette eventually apologized and removed the three articles from their website, but it’s clear that the severity of the situation didn’t resonate.

Tipping perpetuates a power imbalance within the service industry, where a server’s livelihood is determined on a stranger’s whim.,Incorporating a standard tax into meal costs would be a much more stable and equitable system.,Those in favour of tipping say it encourages good service and punishes bad service. However, if service at a restaurant is subpar, it’s more effective to inform a manager than to passive-aggressively deny an employee their chance at an adequate income. There are too many variables that influence the dining experience. A server shouldn’t be punished if the food was late or not up to par, because they can’t control all restaurant operations.,Tipping is an ambiguous practice in itself. We tip servers, hair stylists and cab drivers only because it’s customary, but other types of service workers are left without.,A major concern with no-tipping policies is that servers might feel as though they don’t have to provide quality service.,But working within the service industry is just like any other job that doesn’t have tips.,There are other factors that motivate us to do our job well: recognition, the possibility of a promotion and more.,All jobs have requirements, and for servers it’s to provide good service.

Many places pool and distribute tips between servers, bussers, hosts and dishwashers, which can cause needless tension and stress among staff.,In addition, tipping facilitates discrimination towards both the tipper and the tippee.

This fact, however, shouldn’t kick off a rush to defund programs that help new immigrants.,A Statistics Canada study has shown that Canadians from immigrant backgrounds are significantly more likely to attend university than students whose parents were both born in Canada.,This reality can probably be attributed to the values that immigrant parents have in regards to education. Many of these parents are hyper-aware of what their home country lacked and consequently, they encourage their children to take advantage of the possibilities afforded to them in a place like Canada.,These parents are more likely to encourage their children to study in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. This is in contrast to the mentality of more longstanding Canadian families, who tend to have a more lax approach to education that sometimes centres on a “do what makes you happy” type of attitude.,While immigrants and their children are obviously seeing success and many new immigrants to Canada are well-off compared to other Canadians, government programs and initiatives that help immigrants shouldn’t end. Immigrants arrive in Canada without connections and with significant cultural and linguistic barriers in their way. For people in this vulnerable position, government programs are necessary.,All Canadians should embrace the success of relative newcomers to our country as it means we’re a country where people from different identities and social classes can be successful.

This request comes in the wake of many complaints by residents who live nearby. These residents claim that the “yelling and shouting” coming from the field is a genuine nuisance that is especially aggravating to families with small children who have early bed times.,People living near sports fields should anticipate a certain amount of noise up to a reasonable hour. In this specific case, the expectation of silence after 9 p.m. is a sticking point on which the University shouldn’t budge.,While there’s undoubtedly some genuine harm done to families with small children, an enforcement of the by-law represents harm to Queen’s students — from varsity athletes to those who participate in intramurals — who are jostling for space on an increasingly crowded campus.,Long-time residents have the greatest claim to silence, as they might have been in the same location since before the sports field existed at all. However, complaints from residents have to be weighed against the ubiquitous tendency to complain about any and all developments that cause inconvenience.,Ideally, the City, the University and local residents would come together and establish a consensus about proper use of the field in question. However, while Athletics should take a thorough look at scheduling and even consider cuts to some of the latest programming, any resolution should tend towards the University’s position.,We live in a society that’s constantly weighing competing claims and desires.

This came about a year and a half after a vote to continue their fee failed by just 28 votes in the 2012 Fall Referendum.,The February motion was unsuccessful, and Union says that without the fee, their future is in jeopardy.,At Assembly, several student politicians expressed their opposition to the fee or refrained from supporting the art gallery on the grounds that it’s a “niche” service. Others have said that Union’s mandate isn’t broad enough to justify a mandatory fee.,Only 33 per cent of voters cast ballots in the last AMS election. Many previous referendums and elections had even lower turnouts, including last fall’s referendum ,which brought out a disappointing 16 per cent of voters.,The Union Gallery, which provides opportunity not only for students to appreciate art, but also for students to work and operate a gallery firsthand, reports that approximately 5,000 people attend its showings on an annual basis. Five thousand visitors is almost larger than the number of votes cast in this year’s AMS election.,If the Union is too “niche” to deserve a measly $3.75 from each student, an organization like the AMS — which brings out a similarly sized group of members to its elections — is just as “niche”.,No one will deny that Queen’s has a problem with student apathy. However, the fix doesn’t lie in free coffee or superficial attempts to bring out more voters.,The solution has to be systematic. Queen’s students have to realize that the number of opportunities they have on campus and beyond is directly correlated to the number of clubs and services they support on campus, even if they only appeal to a minority of students.,Although Union’s dilemma is tragic, it’s only indicative of a larger problem on campus: self-involvement without compassion for one another.,When we’re asked to support a club we don’t directly benefit from or give them a few bucks through a fee, we often shrug our shoulders and ask “what’s in it for me?”,Every club, service and group on campus has something to offer. Each one of them provides an opportunity that someone — internally or externally — values very much. In aggregate, these experiences make for a vibrant campus life.,Students should recognize this — especially our elected representatives. Writing a service off as “niche” does nothing to combat disengagement.

The campaign hopes to encourage people to think twice about how labelling young girls as “bossy” discourages them from seeking out leadership positions. The campaign ads feature celebrities like Beyoncé and Condoleezza Rice.,Those who claim this is a campaign for want of an actual problem are incorrect. From a young age, girls are taught to be less forward and opinionated than their male counterparts. Later in life, women who are assertive in leadership roles are more likely to be vilified as, unlike men, their behaviour is connected to their gender and they earn labels like “bitch”.,While Sandberg has correctly identified a problem, her solution leaves much to be desired. Instead of telling people to eliminate certain words from their vocabulary, a more forward-thinking campaign would have called for the reclamation of labels like “bossy” or, alternatively, for women to ignore these labels entirely.,However, it’s clear why Sandberg and her co-campaigners took the approach they did. Liberal feminists and mainstream organizations like the Girl Scouts are unlikely to get behind a campaign to reclaim the use of a label like “bossy”, nor would they be likely to highlight non-politically correct labels like “bitch”.,While their approach is understandable, those behind the “Ban Bossy” campaign have embarked on a largely fruitless endeavour. Calling for the discontinuation of one label is unlikely to get at underlying issues. At best, the campaign will serve as a starting point for conversations about gender.,On her hit single “Bossy”, Kelis rapped “I’m Bossy, I’m the bitch you love to hate”. Sandberg could stand to learn from Kelis’ attitude.

So why, then, are we trying to prevent individuals whom we want to be attracted to us from seeing something that has the potential to be extremely endearing?,Yet the benefit of hiding our emotions is clear: showing any kind of vulnerability puts us or our egos at risk for getting hurt. This popular means of seduction is limiting, however, because emotional restraint isn’t an effective means for fostering close relationships.,Restraint of emotions allows us to control the situation, or so we think, because we are waiting to let ourselves be emotionally invested once — and only once — the other person reassures us that our feelings won’t be hurt.,Effortful restraint of our emotions, however, requires that we first admit to ourselves that we have an impulse or desire in need of control. Therefore, it seems to me that our restraint is evidence that we’re already emotionally invested.,Is the dating “game” really just a matter of seducing the other person into showing vulnerability first?,If you say you don’t show vulnerability because you genuinely don’t care, I believe you. I do wonder where the defensive nature surrounding “what we care about” derives from.,Did you, perhaps, appraise caring about something as a bad thing and even offensive?

How can a man who would rather receive a peerage from Britain than remain a citizen of his home country desire a better Canada?,Fraud convictions aside, Black hardly seems like a man dedicated to the Canadian community.,This isn’t the first time a Canadian has been removed from the Order. One of the most famous cases was in 2005 when native leader David Ahenakew was removed for his controversial remarks about the Holocaust. The body that advises the Governor General about who to induct or remove from the Order said that his actions brought “disrepute” to the Order.,The problem with giving out an award for lifetime achievement, and one that requires nebulous “dedication” and “service,” is that it’s typically given in the middle of someone’s life, when they still have the potential to do disreputable things.,The Order’s advisory council likely couldn’t have foreseen that Black would give up his citizenship and hopefully didn’t know he’d be convicted of fraud. For Black, at least, it seems like desiring a better Canada was just a phase that he abandoned when a better, British honour came along.,The only time most Canadians pay attention to the Order of Canada is when people are being removed or are willingly giving up their membership, as Black is now claiming he did in December.,Most of us can’t recall the names or accomplishments of members of the Order of Canada, but we can recall those later deemed unworthy of the honour.,When Canadians can only define their highest civilian honour by what isn’t acceptable, the Order has brought disrepute on itself."},{"title":"In considering divestment","url":"/story/2014-02-10/editorials/considering-divestment/","date":"February 10, 2014","content":"The threat of climate change calls for a response from young people and the institutions that cater to them. University divestment from fossil fuel companies should be seriously considered going forward.,Students at the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria and Simon Fraser University have voted in favour of their student governments encouraging university administrators to divest from the fossil fuel industry. These actions should be seen in the context of the wider divestment movement that hopes to catalyze youth action against climate change.,The revival of environmental consciousness that the divestment movement represents is good to see. There was a much larger discourse about being “green” in years past. While interest in environmental issues has somewhat dissipated, the circumstances are more pressing than ever before.,Universities should be more inclined to social responsibility than other institutions as they are educating young people and should be somewhat responsive to them. Universities, including Queen’s, should strive to be more transparent and democratic when it comes to inquiries and requests from the student body.,While establishing a strict line in terms of ethical investment is difficult, administrators should attempt to compromise with the concerns of their constituencies.,In the specific case of fossil fuel companies, while they are economic giants that ensure a strong economy and provide employment, their long term viability is in question. The unfortunate reality is that a substantial amount of the world’s fossil fuel reserves can’t be burned if we want to avoid runaway climate change.,Divestment isn’t a new tactic; it worked to help end apartheid in South Africa. While divesting from fossil fuel companies might not yield effects as immediately, this new movement hopes to get young people thinking about climate change on an ongoing basis. Moreover, studies have shown that investment portfolios that exclude fossil fuel and coal companies might actually perform better than those that don’t.,While the long history of environmental activism on the west coast means schools there may get action from their administrators, a similar situation at Queen’s is unlikely. Queen’s student body can be apathetic and we have faculties, like Engineering and Commerce, which are heavily entwined with the fossil fuel industry.,However, just because a divestment campaign would run up against the Queen’s establishment, doesn’t mean the dialogue shouldn’t be brought to campus.

The outfit has published little content over the past year and its future was in question before Thursday’s vote.,If the Tartan gets up and running, it will represent healthy competition for the Journal and other media organizations on campus. Competition will improve media content and could result in a wider variety of perspectives on campus issues.,Student newspapers and magazines represent vital opportunities for writing, visual arts and collaboration in a social setting. Fledgling outlets like the Tartan should be nurtured rather than abandoned if only because the current campus media landscape is relatively sparse.,While the Tartan has become notorious in certain circles for its lack of content, this notoriety doesn’t extend beyond the student media and student government “bubbles”. For this reason, ASUS Assembly’s decision to keep the Tartan’s current name was correct as its brand hasn’t been tarnished in the eyes of most students.,The way forward for the Tartan lies in developing a clear mandate, as well as structures, policies and a hiring process conducive to long-term success. The Journal benefits from an “institutional memory” derived from 140 years of existence. Crucially, the Journal’s Editors in Chief are elected rather than hired, a key element of its editorial autonomy.,Editorial autonomy continues to be an outstanding issue for the Tartan. It can’t claim to be autonomous if it continues to hire former ASUS executives as editors. If editorial autonomy is the intention, it should be carried out in practice.,The Tartan’s challenges are not insurmountable. Queen’s TV is an example of a campus media outlet that has made huge strides in the space of a year. The Tartan’s new leadership should consult with other on-campus media organizations so it can draw on the experience of those who have overseen successful turnarounds and implemented effective policies.,Last Thursday, ASUS Assembly saved the Tartan from disappearing completely.

Why do people obsess over the Olympics?,With Team Canada’s exhilarating victories in both men and women’s hockey, it seemed as though every Canadian watching here at home felt at least a little bit of excitement.,But beyond the excitement one feels when watching an action movie, the Olympics seemed to inspire a kind of patriotism — a sense of immense national pride. When the athletes emerged during the opening ceremonies in Sochi, the Olympic Games suddenly acquired significance beyond that of athletic competition. The games became an outlet of patriotic fervour for people around the world.,These emotions aren’t difficult to explain. People feel as though the athletes who represent their country are in some way “one of them”. Even athletes who aren’t well-known prior to the games are revered and placed on a pedestal as representatives of the country. We seem to share an identity.,These emotions can even be explained from a physiological point of view: studies show that watching someone excel at a sport triggers a release of hormones similar those that are released while actually participating in the sport.,One fact that I’m less sure of is the authenticity of the pride people feel for their country. Will this patriotism endure beyond the short two weeks of the Olympics or does it subside quickly once the games are over? Will Canadians years from now remember our Olympic success with pride or will it all be forgotten?,While for some, it may be the latter, I prefer to think that for most people, the Olympics serve more as a reinforcement of a national pride that’s rooted in something much more enduring than the two weeks of competition.,Essentially, the athletes and the medals they win are a tangible reminder of our drive to succeed."},{"title":"University admission test a non-starter","url":"/story/2014-03-14/editorials/university-admission-test-non-starter/","date":"March 14, 2014","content":"Canadian universities shouldn’t institute an admissions test; doing so would simply add additional hurdles and stress, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds.,An editorial published last Thursday in the Globe and Mail entitled “Why top Canadian universities should add an admissions test” framed admissions tests as an “extra dose of excellence”. The piece argued that while “standardized tests are a mixed bag”, an admissions test for upper-tier schools would gauge student “sincerity and commitment” to higher education.,Standardized tests are a flawed model of student assessment. An education system that privileges standardized testing results in “teaching to the test” and more creative and personalized learning is lost in the process. While the editorial falls far short of calling for a full American-style SAT system, the introduction of a university admissions test would mean a rise of these tendencies in Canada.,Jurisdictions that rely heavily on standardized tests and entrance exams have significant problems with unequal outcomes. In the United States, an entire industry caters to elementary and middle school students who need good SAT scores or success on entrance exams for elite public schools. Standardized tests exacerbate inequality because tests preparation courses and materials are expensive.,High school students applying to Canadian universities have enough to worry about without the addition of an admissions test. If young people are already stressed and anxious at high levels, the addition of an admissions test will only exacerbate those problems.,The addition of an admissions test at “elite Canadian universities” seems like a solution looking for a problem. It’s not apparent there are huge issues with the admission process at most schools. The burden of proof is on the shoulders of those advocating for this change; amateurish appeals to “excellence” aren’t nearly enough.,Standardized testing should only be instituted when absolutely necessary.

The trend originated in Australia and has quickly spread across Europe and North America.,While some Neknomination videos are extreme and feature incredible feats of binge drinking, young people were already doing lots of that anyways. Those who see these acts as harmless fun fueling camaraderie amongst friends are right, to a point. Like with any widespread phenomena, however, deeper analysis is necessary.,Neknominations could be seen as an extension of a hyper-masculine “bro culture” which prizes extreme behaviours that are ultimately pointless. The game is certainly exclusionary to a certain degree as not everyone drinks and many of those who do don’t binge drink at the drop of a hat.,Those who have asserted that Neknominations ramp up “peer pressure” to drink are correct. Rather than simply being egged on at a social gathering, those who receive Neknominations have the attention of thousands of social media users.,Still more questions are raised by the fact that Neknominations take place on social media. Are people really doing it out of exuberance or are they motivated by likes, views and shares?,A final consideration for those undertaking Neknominations: think long and hard about the consequences of posting a hard-drinking video to the internet.

The students also voiced concerns about the lack of food options at the new building and the need for a new crosswalk and traffic lights on King St. outside of the location.,Most of the online comments on the Kingston Whig-Standard article about the protest suggest that the students are whiners. While the grouchy grinders who frequent the Whig’s comment boards tend to hyperbolize, they’re correct in that no one should be overly sympathetic to the concerns of these students.,The protestors would have been better off continuing to sit down and consult with Queen’s and the City of Kingston rather than overplaying their hand. These scholars are on the verge of reaping the benefits of a $60 million investment dedicated to their pursuits. All things considered, the protest’s tone was entitled.,Signs that protest participants carried which read “starving artist” and “feed me” were particularly misguided. Despite the absence of a food outlet at the Bader Centre, students are free to bring their own snacks to tide themselves over while they are away from main campus. In the context of this non-predicament, allusions to starvation trivialize the experience of those actually going hungry.,The group does have some reasonable demands. More direct transportation should be arranged so that students aren’t late for their classes. Yet we need to keep in mind that some students already have classes on West Campus that don’t seem to cause major issues.,The group’s complaints about the safety of the location are their most valid. Queen’s administration and the City of Kingston should work towards rectifying these concerns by installing traffic lights or a crosswalk on King St. to ensure student safety.,The Queen’s students who protested on Friday made a tactical error and played into the worst stereotypes of entitled students.

The article also noted that surveys of students show that more than 50 per cent admit to cheating.,These results are completely predictable as the modern university environment virtually guarantees a substantial amount of cheating. Large class sizes mean that professors can’t accurately gauge the integrity of student work. Online quizzes induce cheating because students have virtually no checks on their behaviour when completing them.,When students are confronted with the menial labour of a first-year university course, they know that they’ll get little in terms of life experience or genuine education from studying. As a result, some often gain more real world skills in the collaborative process of cheating in concert with their classmates than they do from actually completing course work.,There are still other reasons that students are motivated to cheat. Some are simply unprepared or unsuited for university and should reconsider their choice to attend at all. Others are fully committed to their program but find it so competitive that cheating becomes an understandable remedy.,At a certain point, especially in particular faculties and classes and on particular assignments and tests, the notion that many people are cheating leads some to believe that not cheating will leave them at a significant disadvantage.,A modern university education is one that is often undertaken in order to build a resume. Moreover, students face constant reminders that the current job market is tough and high marks should be sought at all costs. There’s only so much selfishness that can be absorbed without it being taken to its logical conclusion — cheating.,Cheating has always been a part of the university experience, but it shouldn’t surprise anyone if it’s on the rise.

According to the piece, the first news outlet to report the bad news was the Wall Street Journal, which tweeted an unsourced assertion of the actor’s demise. Soon after, other news outlets reported the story, supplying details about the circumstances of Hoffman’s death and his struggles with addiction.,The article went on to use these events as a case study about the deteriorated ethics of journalism. One of the author’s central concerns was that Hoffman’s immediate family may have found out about his death through the news media instead of privately.,It’s easy to see why news organizations clamour to be the first to report the death of a celebrity. Media companies are on tight budgets and social media ensures a relentless news cycle that journalists have to stay on top of at all times. “If you’re not first, you’re last” is the central operating principle in newsrooms.,While this mentality is a reaction to real circumstances, there’s no reason for every media outlet to join a race to the bottom. Readers expect real reporting with context and proper sourcing from reputable news organizations like the Wall Street Journal — not one-off tweets.,While many people claim emotional connections to Hollywood celebrities, those connections don’t compare to familial bonds. Moreover, a celebrity’s death doesn’t have the same public interest that the death of a politician or other head of state does. This is all the more reason for reporters and editors to take a pause and allow time for families to find out about the deaths of their loved ones before making the news public.,Despite the incredibly competitive state of journalism, certain practices aren’t inevitable.

The author asserts that professors are already well-paid and that job actions are motivated by greed.,Faculty strikes do cause harm. They delay the completion of degrees, cost students hard-earned money and can ruin a school’s reputation. While a conscientious faculty union would keep these factors in mind, they shouldn’t be used to intimidate professors from striking.,Indeed, professors have a right to strike as they aren’t performing an essential service. Labour disputes are messy and tiresome, but they are the best way that society has to ensure economic equality. These basic facts aren’t up for debate.,Quite different from how they’re portrayed in the Maclean’s editorial, professors are passionate professionals with wider considerations than just their paycheck. We should honour and respect those responsible for educating youth and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.,More than anything, the author’s demonization of professors is tiresome. He does mention administrator’s salaries but quickly moves on in pursuit of the central target. What the author neglects to mention is that administration costs — as a percentage of university budgets — have risen faster than faculty pay in the last 20 years.,University professors deserve high incomes and should continue to advocate for them on an ongoing basis.

In the past, those who used an AMA to self-promote were treated mercilessly by the Reddit community.,It’s possible that Wynne and her backers were simply arrogant enough to believe that there would be no backlash against her actions.

This, in combination with Reddit’s famed “hive mind” mentality, resulted in a huge backlash against Wynne.,While it’s true that no one who does an AMA is required to answer critical questions, and Wynne couldn’t have satisfied many of her critics even if she had answered, taking this route effectively renders an AMA pointless as there’s nothing that differentiates it from an email to supporters.,While our standards for politicians and political campaigning have lowered over time, politics should be more than simply public relations and marketing. This is what makes Reddit’s backlash so positive — it proves there are still places that politicians will be held to a higher intellectual standard.,Wynne and her team failed to factor in common sense and account for historical precedent when they undertook a Reddit AMA. This entire situation is symbolic of the large divide between the unregulated debate of the Internet and the carefully orchestrated theatre of party politics.,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Mental training","url":"/story/2014-02-13/editorials/mental-training/","date":"February 13, 2014","content":"Helping a friend battle a mental illness is easier said than done.,You’ve gone through all the motions that every anti-stigma campaign has encouraged you to do. This friend now feels comfortable enough to tell you that they are having a difficult time — they might even say they don’t want to live anymore.,Once you know a friend is suffering, what’s the next step? Trying to convince someone that their situation isn’t permanent, and that it’s possible to handle their mental illness is a difficult task. You can be left feeling helpless.,As Queen’s continues to make mental health a priority, there needs to be more guidance here for those who want to help others.,As a campus, it seems we’ve decided collectively to support those with mental illness. During the Bell Let’s Talk campaign, I saw virtually everyone on Facebook or Twitter participate.,We’ve also done a great job of tackling stigma. Groups such as the Queen’s Mental Health Awareness Committee (MHAC) and the Jack Project have done an admirable job of erasing stigma about mental illness and working towards ensuring we’ll never have a string of deaths like Queen’s saw in the 2010-11 school year.,Mike Condra, director of Health, Counseling and Disability Services (HCDS) said there’s been over 6,000 Queen’s community members in the past six years who came in for counseling.,Now that we’ve tackled stigma, we need to learn how to actually help when someone asks for support. HCDS recommends listening to those suffering from mental illness and to refer them to a counselor.,However, in my experience, simply hearing someone out and telling them to seek help isn’t enough. Attempting to comfort through words of care and concern isn’t enough either. It’s just a small first step.,Just as someone working at a suicide hotline is trained on how to talk someone down from a suicide attempt, we all need to know tangible ways to respond to our friends seeking help.,If that extra effort isn’t made, those suffering will be discouraged from opening up. Saying “it’s ok”, or “I know how you feel” won’t always be what they need from you.,Supporting a friend who is suffering requires a lot more attention and investment then an anti-stigma campaign can provide. We need to be taught how to help."},{"title":"Bored with boor Ford","url":"/story/2014-02-11/editorials/bored-boor-ford/","date":"February 11, 2014","content":"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford’s recent comments about the Pride Parade and the rainbow flag border on outright homophobia. He’s further marginalizing LGBT people at a time when they need solidarity.,Last Wednesday, Ford stated that he would never attend Toronto’s Pride Parade, saying “I’m not going to change the way I am.” Two days later, he requested that a rainbow flag representing gay pride be removed from a ceremonial flag pole at Toronto City Hall.,The flag had been raised to coincide with the beginning of the Sochi Olympics, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government has passed laws criminalizing gay life and has tolerated anti-gay violence. Ford justified his request for the flag’s removal, saying, “This is not about someone’s sexual preference … it’s the Olympics – this is about being patriotic to your country”.,Ford and his supporters are incorrect when they act as if the ongoing politicizing of the Sochi Olympics is unique or misguided. The Olympics have been political for a long time, beginning with the Berlin Olympics and subsequent boycotts through the 1980s.,Putin’s anti-gay laws and Russia’s overall anti-gay climate should be condemned. The world’s attention has forced Putin to slightly soften his stance and state that the Olympics will take place “without any discrimination on the basis of any characteristic”. Actions of solidarity aren’t just symbolic, the world’s attention has had real effects.,If anything, Ford has effectively aligned himself with Putin as both leaders are intent on espousing a brand of patriotism that is exclusionary to LGBT people. As many have pointed out in the wake of this controversy, Canadian patriotism should include a firm commitment to LGBT rights as that’s one of the main things that differentiate us from a place like Russia.,In the aftermath of these controversies, some commentators have theorized that Ford is actively pandering to homophobes in hopes of winning their votes in the upcoming mayoral election.,While this might seem unlikely in the context of Toronto’s mostly progressive politics, Ford still has a substantial base of support. It remains to be seen if he will be re-elected. No matter what happens, whether he is re-elected or his time in power comes to an end, we face the possibility of a still more brazen and offensive Ford – an ugly prospect.,His actions reflect poorly on the City of Toronto. Ford and his supporters are ignorant of the highly political history of the Olympics and should accept that Canada’s broad acceptance of LGBT rights is worth promoting.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"In defence of feelings","url":"/story/2014-02-11/editorials/defence-feelings/","date":"February 11, 2014","content":"I firmly believe that art should be able to break you.,Art should have enough power over you that it’s totally possible for it to ruin your life a little bit. Every once in a while, you should experience something so intense that you feel terrible after it happens, because it allows you to discover something about yourself you might not have realized previously.,One of the greatest things about art is that it can provide a no-consequences trigger for you to have that experience. Recently, I saw something that got me thinking about how we relate to art as we age. It’s a YouTube video titled “Jackson crying at A Great Big World’s ‘Say Something’ feat. Christina Aguilera,” and it’s the single most inspiring thing I’ve ever seen.,I’ve never heard the song “Say Something”. The small portion I heard in the video doesn’t stimulate any feelings within me aside from a slightly nagging desire to listen to something else. But here, a four-year-old child feels this song so intensely that he’s moved to tears, and somehow ― again, at the age of four ― has the emotional and intellectual wherewithal to know that he is going through something important.,So, when his dad repeatedly asks him if he’d rather listen to something else ― something, perhaps, less emotionally devastating for him ― he shakes his head and boldly continues to feel, dammit. I can respect that.,Do you know how rarely I break into full-on sobbing when a song comes on? I almost never do. Granted, I’m a 21-year-old man, but should I really let that stop me?,As we age, we get desensitized to everything, but especially to art and especially now. It has become so easily attainable for free and with little effort. We’ve made it disposable and, consequently, we’ve walled ourselves off from spontaneously connecting with it in any way that is meaningful. Who wants to open themselves up to something or somebody they don’t even value?,I’m not claiming to be the first person to make this observation ― it’s the year 2014, and I’m fully aware of that. Even the word “internet” sounds dated in 2014.,But this is why Jackson is amazing, and why I’m a little bit jealous of him ― comparatively new to this world, he’s yet to have his feelings spoiled. He doesn’t know that they’re no longer in vogue. He just heard a song one day and it moved him.

However, it’s inevitable that judgement will happen, and seen in a wider societal context, her choices do deserve some criticism.,The freshman student at the North Carolina university has been “outed” as a porn performer. The student in question claims that she entered the business to pay tuition. She asserts that her experiences in the industry have been empowering and that she’s a feminist.,Humans should be able to make decisions that do not directly harm others. When someone undertakes an action that passes that test, they shouldn’t face the coercive judgment that many are heaping upon this woman. This is why those who “outed” the woman are misguided.,While one individual’s choice shouldn’t be up for debate, the context that surrounds that choice should always be examined. Sex work — like performing in pornography, stripping and prostitution — is often undertaken by those with limited options for decent pay, or any employment whatsoever. Needless to say, no one should feel immense pressure to enter these fields.,While just about everybody is coerced by economic circumstance in one way or another, the experiences of those doing sex work warrant extra attention as they are likely worse than the experiences of those in more typical sectors of employment.,Porn performers have to contend with the fact that images of them engaging in sex acts will be available forever. Moreover, the production of pornography is often very misogynistic in nature and female performers are frequently pressured into doing extreme sex acts.,This is what makes the woman’s claim that her actions are in line with feminism somewhat suspect. While her personal choice to enter porn is completely fine, tying her choice to the wider feminist movement may not be valid, as some feminists have been critical of the pornography industry.,Overall, the young woman is undoubtedly somewhat naïve about what she has undertaken. When asked about how her pornographic performances will affect her prospects for employment, she insists that she “wouldn’t want to work for someone who discriminates against sex workers”. These could be the words of a young person who hasn’t fully considered the ramifications of her actions.,The sad truth is that while in an ideal world, people wouldn’t judge those who perform in pornography, judgement is the norm. Unfortunately, this social climate means that performing in pornography isn’t a pragmatic choice for a young person who probably has other options.,While individual porn performers shouldn’t be held up and ridiculed as social pariahs, the wider context that informs their choice is ripe for criticism. A discerning person would probably avoid performing in pornography, as our society isn’t ready to accept it.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Anon should stop","url":"/story/2014-01-24/editorials/anon-should-stop/","date":"January 24, 2014","content":"An anonymous blog and Twitter account called Queen’s Elections has popped up to cover the ongoing AMS elections. The content of the blog has caused some small controversies as it’s gossipy in nature and sometimes focuses on the personal motivations of those running for student politics.,In general, this type of news coverage is something to be concerned about, because whoever is behind it is unaccountable and is adding little to campus political life. Anonymous blogs that spread rumours might actually increase student apathy as they make campus politics seem petty and negative.,To a degree, the author of the blog is concerned about the credibility of what he writes as he or she retracted content that was refuted. While this responsiveness is better than nothing, the fact that the author would publish something and then delete it soon after shows that his or her standards for reporting information are probably low.,In addition to lacking adequate reporting standards, the blogs adds little in the way of analysis. Some of it is simply sarcastic rumour and personal caricature. Surely this is the type of discourse that should be dismissed in favour of more incisive and constructive analysis.,Even if an organization or blog exists to smear or discredit, the people behind it should step forward and take responsibility for their actions. Those behind the NOPIRG campaign proved that this is entirely possible and they even managed to rally a modicum of student opinion to their cause. Unlike Queen’s Elections, NOPIRG is accountable because its members identified themselves.,While everyone engages in gossip from time to time, putting content on the internet gives it a life of its own. There’s effectively no way to regulate this type of behaviour but it should be condemned as regressive.

I’m not as dumb or lazy as they thought.,This stigma is incredibly undeserved.,The fifth-year student is making a choice that’s smarter than most others. While fourth-years might be plagued with cliché anxieties and obsessively reading thinkpieces about the “20-something struggle”, the fifth year is usually a bit more relaxed - probably with a drink in hand.,We’ve been trained to compress our education into four years. While that works for some students, there are those of us who are getting more out of our wonder years by taking some extra time.,That’s not to say that the fifth-year student isn’t a nervous wreck. Grad school applications don’t get easier over time - believe me - but there’s something to be said for knowing thyself.,Once upon a time, the Ontario curriculum had what was called grade 13. This was an extra year, tacked onto the end of high school, which allowed students to take a bit more time with their secondary education. They could stop and smell the textbooks, perhaps.,Now that grade 13 is gone, some students choose to take a gap year anyway. I still see the same condescending looks given to them - like they, similar to the fifth-year, couldn’t handle that quick jump to the “logical” next step.,Whether it’s to work at the student paper, or to get a higher GPA for that dream school, the fifth year is not something to sneer at.,It takes a mature person to know what they want to do with their life.

Doping in baseball needs to be heavily cracked down on, and this is the place to start.,In July 2013, 13 players were suspended for 50 or more games, with Rodriguez receiving a suspension through the end of the 2014 season and postseason. He was the only player to appeal.,In early January, an arbitrator upheld the suspension, though the 49 games Rodriguez played while his appeal was pending effectively reduced the sentence.,Baseball fans are bitterly divided about this. Almost no one doubts that Rodriguez is guilty of doping — the main issue is the way MLB went about the investigation.,MLB came under fire for purchasing Biogenesis documents from a former clinic employee. An uncooperative witness was threatened with a lawsuit. It’s been alleged that players were strong-armed into accepting their suspensions, and asserted that Rodriguez’s sentence damages the authority of the players’ union.,MLB’s investigative team deserves criticism for how it handled the Biogenesis investigation. However, Selig shouldn’t be attacked for cracking down on doping.,Many have criticized him for encouraging the steroid era by not enforcing a ban on performance-enhancing drugs until 12 years after it had been put in place. Despite his past mistakes, he’s doing the right thing now.,Former player Jose Canseco argues that doping in baseball shouldn’t be a big deal. If they’re all doing it, why not let them? Baseball has a history of amphetamine abuse; what makes steroids any different?,The argument that “they’re all doing it” is disrespectful to players who don’t use steroids. Doping makes the playing field uneven, and players who stay clean are unfairly compared to players who dope.,Rodriguez and his litany of scandals are symptoms of a greater problem.

She compares her situation to those with peanut allergies.,Dairy products are more ubiquitous than other food allergens. Therefore an outright ban is virtually out of the question. Allergies to dairy products are rarer than peanut allergies, and the consistency of foods like peanut butter make them more likely to “spread” between children.,However, while the school did take some steps to protect the student from her allergies – including switching to no-cheese pizza and suspending the school’s milk program ― they haven’t gone far enough and should redouble their efforts to accommodate the child.,Arguments saying the mother should enroll her daughter in a private school that is willing to accommodate the child’s predicament or begin homeschooling are short-sighted. Excluding a child from public school should be an absolute last resort, as most private schools are expensive, and homeschooling requires time and resources that many families don’t have.,Before effectively excluding the student, the school could institute measures to isolate her from allergens. The child in question could be completely separated from the other students during lunch, or the school could institute a strict hand washing or sanitizing process for students who have eaten lunches with allergens.,The school shouldn't fear the inevitable backlash from other parents as their concerns don’t compare to those of the mother whose child is in danger.,There are limits to accommodation, but they haven’t yet been reached in this case.

The Globe also published an online poll asking respondents if they support public funding for Catholic education. While the Globe is responsible for the latest skirmish over religious education in Ontario, the overall debate is longstanding.,Catholic schools in Ontario are fully funded while other religious schools flounder due to lack of funds or charge students a hefty amount to attend. In 1999, the United Nations admonished the Ontario system for its selectivity in education. The UN is correct: Ontario should fund all religious schooling equally or create a completely secular school system.,As it stands, some parents send their children to Catholic schools because they believe it will provide a more disciplined, religious or socially conservative environment. Still, others seem to want their children in a more culturally homogenous setting. In some areas, parents prefer Catholic schools because they receive more funding than public alternatives.,Most of these motivations are either reprehensible or short-sighted. While there exists a fundamental right to religious education, it shouldn’t be fully funded by taxpayers. Similarly, cultural homogeneity is something to be avoided rather than encouraged with public money. Moreover, inequalities between schools would be softened if Ontario’s current school system was eliminated in favour of a completely secular one.,Ontario’s system was originally established to ensure that a large Catholic minority would have its religious freedom protected during a more sectarian period in our history. Now, however, Ontario is a much more secular society with many different religious groups.,While reforming the current system may be tough because it would require a long battle and a constitutional challenge, it should at least be attempted. The creation of one secular school system would be an improvement on the status quo. A more realistic option would see religious schools of all faiths receive a set amount of funding.,Ontario should abandon its current system of Catholic schools as they are a relic from a societal context that has long passed. Our values have changed and, as long as we’re going to have religious education at all, we should cater to new religious groups that deserve funding every bit as much as Catholics.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Your story","url":"/story/2014-01-21/editorials/your-story/","date":"January 21, 2014","content":"When I was 11 years old, my dance teacher asked my class to write 100 words about ourselves.,Here’s how far I got: “Emily is in grade six, and loves to dance.

The hours were requested by female students for a variety of different reasons ranging from religious modesty to unfair cultural expectations of women.,Women should have the option of working out in the exclusive company of other women. Ideally however, women’s-only hours would be a stand-in until a permanent women’s-only space is established.,The case for a gender segregated option in campus gyms is overwhelming. A women’s-only space results in a different dynamic that may be conducive to a more relaxed workout for some. Some women find the exclusive presence of other women is a positive social change; others have more immediate concerns about being pursued or harassed by men while working out.,Broad tendencies towards gender segregation should be avoided for several reasons, however. Reinforcing a strict gender dichotomy is never ideal. Humans should not be fixed in place; ideally they would be able to move freely through identities and space. In more concrete terms, gender segregation, especially at younger ages, results in poor socialization and discomfort around the opposite sex.,In effect, we can’t hide from each other. Excluding a gender from an entire gym for hours at a time should be a last resort as it reinforces gendered stereotypes and a dichotomy. Not all men are creeps, and not all women are body-positive.,As an alternative to gender segregation, gym staff could get increased training in order to deal with situations where women feel threatened or otherwise uncomfortable.,Ryerson already has a women’s-only workout space.

The AMS advised students to be wary of these emails and to keep in mind that they're not required to meet with Student Affairs under such circumstances.,It turned out, according to the AMS, that the emails were part of a Student Affairs “fact finding” process that was initiated after the administration received reports of a hazing incident that took place earlier in the year.,According to Queen’s Provost Alan Harrison, “if and when reports concerning health and safety are made directly to a university department or office, the university has an obligation to gather information where possible on the report and determine what follow up, if any, is required on the part of the university.”,While it's understandable that the administration is concerned about student well-being, there's no reason that this concern should undermine established and effective student-run processes.,NAD is unique in North America and has continued for over 100 years because of its effectiveness. The process rests on the laudable principle that someone is best judged by their peers rather than a bureaucratized hierarchy.,The students who run NAD get invaluable experience and take their mandate seriously, just like those who operate Queen’s other student-run organizations and bodies. If this experience is going to be diluted by actions like those undertaken by Student Affairs, then the administration should clearly and publicly justify them.,In Sept. 2012, Principal Woolf signed an agreement securing the responsibilities of NAD as a peer-run judicial system. Moreover, according to AMS Vice-President of University Affairs Thomas Pritchard, NAD has already handled situations where “student health and wellness” was at risk.,Despite officially endorsing NAD’s responsibilities, the administration seems content to undermine them. They claim there's a substantive difference between the “fact finding” process they are conducting and an “investigation” in which they'd have to involve the AMS. Needless to say, this is a distinction without discernible difference.,If the administration thinks that NAD is somehow deficient then they should say so, rather than acting in an ambiguous and underhanded manner.

The reasons for abstaining varied. Some editorial board members have personal relationships with candidates and campaign staff, while others lacked confidence in either team, or in the endorsement process.,Team WRL has been working on their campaign for months whereas it seems SMH — comprised of presidential candidate Scott Mason, vice-president of operations candidate Mark Asfar and vice-president of university affairs candidate Hasina Daya — came together much later in the game. Ultimately, WRL’s extra preparation and internal experience make them the stronger team.,While the teams fit into the typical “insider” versus “outsider” narrative — WRL has more AMS experience whereas SMH team members have a more external perspective — the team’s platforms were fairly similar. Due to this likeness, the bulk of the Journal’s Editorial Board was swayed by qualities like managerial potential, professionalism, experience, team composition and team cohesion.,These qualities were epitomized by WRL’s Reekie, who fielded questions with aplomb. Williams was similarly striking in her breadth of knowledge as she talked at length about topics ranging from software updates to the challenges that increased enrolment will bring to our campus.,WRL’s Philip Lloyd was the least notable of his teammates. However, he had a good answer when asked how his academic experiences have influenced his perspective as a student politician.,As a team, WRL is cohesive. They communicate well and seem to have confidence in each other’s abilities. They were well-prepared and responded well to virtually every question asked of them. They really are the quintessential “insider” team of professionals.,While this identity is mostly a positive thing because it implies competence, it could be alienating to students who want a more approachable AMS executive.,Approachability is perhaps SMH’s greatest asset as a team. Their shtick is more down-to-earth in comparison to WRL’s clinical and corporate style. This fact, in combination with platform points that cater to minority groups like introducing kosher and halal food at Common Ground, might be appealing to students who feel left out of student politics.,Unfortunately, while SMH might be the less intimidating option, they seemed disjointed and disorganized as a team when responding to questions from the Editorial Board. They sometimes struck a sarcastic and oppositional tone, which didn’t seem conducive to a successful year leading the AMS. To an extent, their answers showed a lack of long-term focus on important issues like increasing enrolment.,In some ways, SMH’s Daya is representative of the team as a whole. She had a great answer when asked about the struggles facing “Castle kids” like herself, who arrive to Queen’s in second year. There was nothing on this subject, however, in SMH’s platform.,Asfar wasn’t wholly convincing when attempting to justify why kosher alternatives were a feasible option at Common Ground.,If there’s one shining star on team SMH, it’s presidential candidate Mason. He was convincing when asked about team SMH’s controversial plan to endorse a mayoral candidate. His explanation of the AMS’s relationship with the City of Kingston was the sort of in-depth guide to AMS responsibilities that is the norm when talking to team WRL.,Compounding their overall middling answers was SMH’s overreliance on anecdotes when justifying their platform and goals. Alternatively, team WRL consistently talked about how they’ve been consulting with figures in the administration about academic issues, and those experienced in the bar and restaurant industry about their plans for The Underground and Common Ground.,Instead of being constrained by their breadth of knowledge and experience within the AMS, WRL was successful in portraying this “insider” status as a great benefit. In any event, a perceived “outsider” team is unlikely to create a great paradigm shift within the AMS, as Queen’s students found out last year in the case of BGP (now BPP).,As high-level managers in their positions for only one year, the AMS executive has to be effective quickly and command the respect of their employees and volunteers. WRL’s competence and professionalism put them in the best position to fulfill this mandate. Their thick platform was not just a gimmick — they’ve done their research and have demonstrated the ability to follow through.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Tinder is a winner","url":"/story/2014-02-04/editorials/tinder-winner/","date":"February 4, 2014","content":"The advent of the new dating app Tinder is a mostly positive development as the application gives its users a platform to engage with possible mates in a quick and painless manner that can be safer than alternatives.,On Jan. 27, Maclean’s On Campus published an article that analyzed the rise of Tinder on university campuses. Tinder is an application that uses geolocation to match users by proximity. Users look through photos of nearby users and swipe right to “like” a profile or swipe left to move onto the next. If two users have “liked” each other, then it’s revealed as a match, and they can message one another.,The  article alleged that Tinder primarily caters to users looking for casual sex rather than relationships and perpetuates “hook-up culture.”,Tinder has many benefits. It’s marginally safer than other methods of online dating as it requires users to connect their profile to their Facebook account. It’s easy and convenient, and allows users to make quick connections without any initial awkwardness or hassle.,For people in their early 20s who tend to be busy and disinclined to start long-term relationships, Tinder is the perfect avenue for casual dating.,While it’s possible Tinder might slightly aggravate “hook-up culture”, that’s far from clear. What’s more, “hook-up culture” isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Hook-up culture” is a label invented by overly-concerned middle age adults to describe youth exercising sexual freedom. The sexual culture on university campuses isn’t perfect, but it certainly doesn’t fit into one overarching term with negative connotations.,Nevertheless, young people should be somewhat concerned about the trend towards efficiency in sex and dating. One of Tinder’s possible downsides is that it removes a certain amount of face-to-face interaction from the dating process. Tinder might also aggravate the pre-existing superficiality that pervades young people’s sex lives, as flipping through photo-based profiles can take on a commodified meat-market-like quality.,Tinder provides a useful platform for young people who desire an easy way to meet others in their vicinity. It might slightly increase the tendency towards casual sex, but who cares? Its combined problems do not negate its great utility.,-Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Student Affairs undermine NAD","url":"/story/2014-01-21/editorials/student-affairs-undermine-nad/","date":"January 21, 2014","content":"The AMS is concerned that the University is encroaching on the mandate of the student-run Non-Academic Discipline system (NAD) at Queen’s.,Last week, it was revealed that several students received emails from the Student Affairs office, requesting meetings to discuss something that was left unstated. The AMS advised students to be wary of these emails and to keep in mind that they're not required to meet with Student Affairs under such circumstances.,It turned out, according to the AMS, that the emails were part of a Student Affairs “fact finding” process that was initiated after the administration received reports of a hazing incident that took place earlier in the year.,According to Queen’s Provost Alan Harrison, “if and when reports concerning health and safety are made directly to a university department or office, the university has an obligation to gather information where possible on the report and determine what follow up, if any, is required on the part of the university.”,While it's understandable that the administration is concerned about student well-being, there's no reason that this concern should undermine established and effective student-run processes.,NAD is unique in North America and has continued for over 100 years because of its effectiveness. The process rests on the laudable principle that someone is best judged by their peers rather than a bureaucratized hierarchy.,The students who run NAD get invaluable experience and take their mandate seriously, just like those who operate Queen’s other student-run organizations and bodies. If this experience is going to be diluted by actions like those undertaken by Student Affairs, then the administration should clearly and publicly justify them.,In Sept. 2012, Principal Woolf signed an agreement securing the responsibilities of NAD as a peer-run judicial system. Moreover, according to AMS Vice-President of University Affairs Thomas Pritchard, NAD has already handled situations where “student health and wellness” was at risk.,Despite officially endorsing NAD’s responsibilities, the administration seems content to undermine them. They claim there's a substantive difference between the “fact finding” process they are conducting and an “investigation” in which they'd have to involve the AMS. Needless to say, this is a distinction without discernible difference.,If the administration thinks that NAD is somehow deficient then they should say so, rather than acting in an ambiguous and underhanded manner. Queen’s prides itself on effective student-run organizations, bodies and systems like NAD, but this pride is meaningless if students aren't shouldering the responsibilities involved.,-Journal Editoral Board "},{"title":"Homecoming change for the best","url":"/story/2014-01-24/editorials/homecoming-change-best/","date":"January 24, 2014","content":"Queen’s administration has decided to switch back to a one weekend format for next year’s Homecoming celebration. The two weekend format only existed for one go-around; it was shelved because it was a strain on university resources, according to Queen’s Principal Daniel Woolf.,The administration made the right decision, as virtually no one was attached to the two weekend format. It didn’t noticeably curtail the worst of Homecoming’s problems and might have detracted from its best aspects. Having made the right call, the administration should now focus on making Homecoming the great celebration it has the potential to be.,The motivation for the change is somewhat suspect in light of the fact that the OUA football schedule effectively ruled out the possibility of having two Homecoming football games. Hopefully Queen’s Athletics will orchestrate a less chaotic process for getting students their football tickets, as the game is still Homecoming’s central event.,While it’s possible that a one weekend format could concentrate student partying and re-inflate the Aberdeen St. party, most students treated the first weekend of this year’s Homecoming as the main party weekend.,At best, the second weekend was a convenient excuse for the most hardcore revellers at Queen’s. At worst, it was cause for anxiety as many students felt pressure to find the energy for another weekend of getting up early, making pancakes, day drinking and rah-rah nonsense.,Hopefully Queen’s administration consulted alumni before this recent change, as it’s their celebration, after all. It’s easy for undergraduates to forget this as there’s little programming that combines alumni and students.,A two weekend Homecoming was the wrong format, as it didn’t serve its intended purpose of taming a one weekend confluence of student partying. In the end, it diluted the excitement among both alumni and students about our revered reunion weekend.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Virgin-Shaming","url":"/story/2014-02-04/editorials/virgin-shaming/","date":"February 4, 2014","content":"We’ve all seen one of those movies.,That dorky, young man comes on screen, stutters around the girls and is eventually is made a “real” man by a woman’s touch. The virgin: he’s just the latest in a long line of Hollywood stock characters. We pity him due to his inexperience and cheer him on when he’s sealed the deal.,In recent years, “slut-shaming” has become a buzzword. Individuals who deviate from traditional gender expectations are shamed ― for requesting birth control, engaging in premarital sex or as victims of rape or sexual assault. Discourses have emerged that recognize slut-shaming as a heinous practice that needs to be abolished.,But there’s another side to this coin. As gender expectations have shifted in our society, a new shaming process surrounding sexual activity is on the rise: virgin-shaming.,In some circles, the virgin is treated as a unicorn of sorts. Often the rational is that there must be something wrong with them. They must be undesirable, unwanted or just plain weird. The male virgin just isn’t a “real” man, while the female virgin must be some sort of sheltered religious nut.,We’re pressured into believing that maturity, liberation and self-knowledge are somehow only obtainable through experience in sexcapades ― that somehow without these things, we don’t truly know ourselves.,I have numerous friends who’ve “lost it” to strangers in unsafe and uncomfortable circumstances just to “get it over with.” Safety aside, something so inherently personal should never be the result of pressure, guilt or feeling ashamed of inexperience.,There are so many reasons why people choose abstinence: they’re waiting for marriage, they want it to be special, they identify as asexual, etc. But at the end of the day, when it comes down to shaming, the reason is irrelevant. These misconceptions need to be shed and we should strive to make social environments safer and more inclusive.,I think that it’s about time we stopped shaming people who take a different sexual course than ourselves."},{"title":"Uni blues","url":"/story/2014-01-24/editorials/uni-blues/","date":"January 24, 2014","content":"Some might say I came to Queen’s for the wrong reasons.,Tradition dictates that arts students don’t go to university for career preparation.

If you want practicality, you go to college.,Yet five years ago, I felt that going to Queen’s would be a good stepping stone to a job in my yet-to-be-determined career path. I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue as a career, and I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself in a vocational program.,I imagine there are lots of students out there like me. This justification for coming to university is becoming more and more reasonable as enrolment numbers soar and job markets become increasingly cutthroat.,The problem, however, is that arts faculties at universities like Queen’s aren’t adapting to the growing number of career-focused students.,I now know that I want to be a journalist, and I’ve been lucky enough to get practical experience through my time working at the Journal. However, I still feel I could have been more formally prepared.,This feeling of unpreparedness hits particularly hard when I see my peers in vocational programs, such as commerce, graduate with finely honed interview skills, networking experience and an exchange or co-op placement under their belts.,The skills arts grads develop could be invaluable to the same employers commerce or engineering students are hoping to be hired by. For example, the oratory skills a drama student develops could make them a key candidate for a sales position.,But the resources the University offers arts students are limited, putting us at a disadvantage. Queen’s co-op programs are heavily science- and engineering-focused, and there are few networking, recruiting and career skills events targeted to arts students.,Many arts students are here to gain critical learning skills, but we need formal support from the University, the Faculty and our student government to translate them into practical experience. These days, we need practicality to make us as competitive as possible in a tough job market.,Times are changing, and the university needs to adapt to the shifting purpose of our education."},{"title":"Obesity due to inequality","url":"/story/2014-01-17/editorials/obesity-due-inequality/","date":"January 17, 2014","content":"A recent study shows that national rates of obesity for adolescents between 12 and 19 didn’t rise during the 2000s. However, “among teens from poorer, less well-educated families, obesity has continued to rise”.,Adolescents with well-educated parents, however, saw obesity rates decline from 14 per cent to seven per cent while those of the same age with parents with no more than high-school education had their rate of obesity rise from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.,There are innumerable possible causes for this discrepancy, as children from poorer backgrounds face incredible obstacles to maintaining good health.,For example, many poor parents can’t afford to enroll their children in physical activities or sports leagues. Poorer families are more likely to live in “food deserts” where healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables are hard to access and junk food with high salt, fat and sugar content becomes a quick fix.,A child’s family context is also a very important determinate of their physical health. Children who lack supervision or a structured schedule might defer to less active lifestyle, and many poor families have parents working several jobs.,These challenges are occurring in the context of a widespread turn away from childhood play in modern North American society. Children and adolescents are more likely to be found in a basement playing computer games than outside running around.,More specific to the American context, however, is an increase in economic inequality and reduced social mobility. Those who are born at the bottom of the income scale are likely to stay there.,One reason for these phenomena is physical health. If children grow up unhealthy, they are less likely to have the wherewithal to study hard in school and progress into a fruitful career.

Several weeks have passed since the worst of the weather, but large patches of ice can still be found on campus, and most sidewalks in the surrounding areas are completely covered in ice.,Ice covered sidewalks, walkways and stairs are a huge obstacle for those with disabilities and those who have otherwise reduced mobility. For example, a student with arthritis faces a much longer and more painful walk to class in such conditions. In order to avoid treacherous sidewalks, many students have resorted to walking on the street, a strategy that comes with major hazards of its own.,Queen’s staff have now cleared ice from most high-traffic walkways on campus but their response was too slow and inconsistent.,While Queen’s Student Affairs says, “it is helpful to maintain clear pathways on the sidewalks in front of your home”, the current conditions began when most students were out of town for the holidays. Students returned to heavily packed snow and ice that was nearly impossible to move.,Fortunately, there are some possible solutions to this type of predicament. The City could treat student living areas as a high priority for the removal of ice and snow because it’s a high foot traffic area.,Alternatively, the University could pay for the removal of snow and ice beyond campus borders. This could be justified on the same grounds as the Homecoming “policing fees” that Queen’s is paying to the City, as the University does accept some responsibility for student issues in the surrounding neighbourhood.,No matter what occurs, Queen’s and the City could stand to collaborate to a greater degree on this issue as the current conditions are unacceptable.,Both groups could do a better job of being precise about whose responsibility it is to clear sidewalks so that someone can be held to account.

Ontarians and Torontonians should demand better from their elected representatives.,In general, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne’s attempt to provide grocery gift cards for people whose food had spoiled due to power outages was commendable.,The process of distributing those gift cards left much to be desired, however.

Despite the fact that the student relented and accepted the professor’s judgement, the university administration is accusing the professor of not properly accommodating the student.,The university administration isn’t in an enviable position here as they have to balance the desires of many different stakeholders. Their basic position ― that accommodating the student would have been easy and wouldn’t have caused significant harm ― is understandable, but ultimately misguided.,The professor is right to be concerned about the principle at stake in this situation.,Would such a request even be thinkable if the student had expressed concern about working with Asian people or gay men? Such requests have to be rejected on principle.,It’s not clear why the professor’s consultation of religious experts is relevant at all, as, depending on interpretation, religious texts could theoretically provide justification for all manner of abhorrent things.,The type of mutated political correctness that sometimes motivates university administrators should be removed from all public institutions.

For proposing this tactic, the Rideau Institute comes across as attention-seeking and confrontational at a time when confrontation isn’t productive.,It is important to note, however, that the white poppy has a long history going back to the 1920s.

It doesn’t happen to all of us, but since entering Queen’s, I’ve noted the frequency of these confused and guilt-ridden conversations.,It’s easy to subdue feelings of unease by answering the infamous question of “what am I doing?” with society’s over-prescribed formula: finish high school, choose a career path, get an education, make a living, breed, retire and die. This seemingly straightforward individualistic progress is considered normal.,But is “making a living” and achieving personal success everything? Is that how I’m expected to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life? I struggled with myself over these questions for some time. I think, most of us would intuitively answer “no” to them, but may not be able to say exactly why.,Sometimes we respond to this uncertainty in extremes. On one hand, we can turn into dragons who sit on piles of gold until they corrode away. On the other hand, sometimes it seems like the only way to contribute in a meaningful way is to drop everything and ship ourselves off to a remote Liberian village.,Western society pushes individualism, but we aren’t independent beings. Not only are we constantly interacting with others, but we are constantly benefiting from what others contribute — socially, economically and technologically. So, why is our personal growth and society’s growth considered mutually exclusive?,Think about the brilliant minds that have revolutionized technology, international relations and culture. Their love of knowledge and constant desire for excellence resulted in major changes for society.,It’s time we re-evaluated the purpose of our education, and what our goals are.

The court gave parliament a year to fill the void this judgment left in its wake.,The Supreme Court made the right judgement; sex workers will now be much safer when plying their trade. That was the primary problem with the situation as it existed before: sex workers were forced to the furthest margins of society in fear of the law.,Sex workers can now hire bodyguards. Previously, they resorted primarily to watching out for themselves and each other. Sex workers can now work out of supervised brothels rather than having to be on the street. They can now legally do “in-calls” where clients visit them at home rather than more dangerous “out-calls”. Preferable precautions like STD testing for both sex workers and clients may now be undertaken more easily as well.,While it’s good that sex workers are significantly safer, they now face the prospect of a Conservative majority making laws that regulate their work. Harper could choose to go with the “Nordic model” where clients are criminalized, or the “German model” where sex work is licensed and regulated. Both models have drawbacks but the latter would minimize harm, as criminalizing clients simply recreates the same problems.,Sex work will happen whether legal or illegal, so those who undertake it should be as safe as possible. The Supreme Court’s decision was but one significant step in a march towards the safety and inclusion of some of the most marginalized people in our society.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Referendum reformation","url":"/story/2013-11-08/editorials/referendum-reformation/","date":"November 8, 2013","content":"Fall Referendum results were released last Wednesday with a remarkably low voter turnout of 15.8 per cent. There is plenty of blame to go around for this dismally low number, but the AMS is the primary culprit.,Students have no excuse for their apathy. Voting in a referendum only takes five minutes and it’s relatively easy to get informed about the relevant clubs.,The widely-held notion that referendums are irrelevant to the average student is unfortunate. The clubs requesting an opt-out fee entertain you, advocate for you, inform you and provide creative, professional and social outlets for your peers.,We should strive to prove Mayor Mark Gerretsen wrong when he says that students are apathetic. The way things stand, we are fulfilling a self-involved stereotype. The clubs themselves could have done more to inform students. Aggressively promoting themselves on social media and doing more presentations in lecture would have been effective.,That being said, clubs are disadvantaged by the current rules. As it stands, if voting falls below the 20 per cent cut-off, groups need a 55 per cent vote in the affirmative instead of 50 per cent. The primary job of clubs is get “yes” votes, not raise overall turnout. The current rules should be reformed.,The fact that 6,000 students did not receive timely referendum emails undoubtedly reduced the amount of votes cast. Nothing else could explain the dramatic drop from last year’s 26.33 per cent turnout.,The AMS could do much more to promote and incentivize voting. The AMS emails about the Referendum could be more straightforward and eye-catching. In general, it’s obvious that the Fall Referendum is an afterthought compared to the Winter Referendum and elections.,If turnout remains low, significant reform to the current system should be considered. A possible alternative would see scrapping the referendum altogether and having students prompted to opt out when they pay their students fees.,The AMS needs to step up its game when it comes to promoting referendums. In aggregate, student clubs are just as important as the student government itself so they deserve commensurate attention. We should all resist apathy, if only out of fear that the Mark Gerretsens of the world are proved correct.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Time differences deserved","url":"/story/2013-11-22/editorials/time-differences-deserved/","date":"November 22, 2013","content":"In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of John F.

This isn’t the first instance where the American edition of Time has had a different cover than its international editions.,While we should be somewhat wary of this ongoing pattern, Time is simply specializing its coverage for the US in order to make a profit. Overarching concerns about American ignorance and narrow-mindedness are not warranted.,First and foremost, Time magazine is a business. Most detractors would acknowledge that if Time’s owners could make more money easily, they would. The magazine is based in America and is well-suited to understand American preferences.,Time has to compete with a plethora of other publications, many of which run more typical and serious covers. In this sense, it can separate itself from its competition and respond to differentiated American demand.,Moreover, many of the American Time covers that didn’t appear elsewhere were concerned with American politics and other important American topics. These covers aren’t symbols of American ignorance because Americans are right to prioritize the affairs of their own country.,While critics see these covers as furthering American insularity, they are overstating the importance of a simple cover. The American edition of Time still covered the typhoon in the Philippines, but it just didn’t feature the event on its cover.,In general, Americans, while they could stand to be more informed on international issues, aren’t the compassionless and slack-jawed bunch imagined by some outsiders.,The American edition of Time should continue to stand out.

For example, they usually don’t do house inspections. Ultimately, the quality of an animal’s care comes down to those adopting it.,Having an animal friend is fun on a day-to-day basis, and for students who are wary of being away from home for the first time or are stressed, a pet can provide a welcoming atmosphere. However, the safety of adopted animals should be given as much consideration as the needs of their owners.,Some houses in the Student Ghetto are a genuine threat to health — human or animal. Student schedules are often inconsistent and behaviour can sometimes be raucous and unclean, which isn’t conducive to animal ownership.,Animals can be incredibly expensive and time-consuming. Students on tight budgets shouldn’t take on an animal; vet bills can cause financial stress and conflict.,Students who want to adopt a pet should think long and hard about the realities of providing for one, as animal ownership tends to be incompatible with the average student’s lifestyle.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Issue 18: Darts & Laurels","url":"/story/2013-10-29/editorials/issue-18-darts-laurels/","date":"October 29, 2013","content":"Darts,AMS involved in multiple voting mishaps,The AMS should take pause after having been involved in several voting mishaps in the span of two years. Last year, counting errors resulted in a delayed announcement of the winter election results. This past week, nearly 6,000 Fall Referendum ballot logins weren’t sent when they were supposed to, due to a technical issue with the Queen’s email system and Votenet. The AMS risks a deteriorated reputation if these issues continue. It’s not in anyone’s interest to have a student government known for screwing up elections and referendums. The latest incidents may not have been the direct fault of the AMS; however, recurring problems raise questions about the quality of our voting system.,The Communications Office could have also done more to notify students about the missed email. When the AMS has its own initiative to promote, such as the recent “Let’s Not Fuck It Up” campaign, there was no problem getting the word out. Overall, the current voting arrangements need to be rethought. Effective democracy is at issue here; every student should have a vote that is properly conducted the first time around.,McDonald’s employee directed to food stamps,When McDonald’s employees call a designated employee hotline to complain that they aren’t earning enough to support their families, “Mc-Resources” employees direct them to government assistance programs. This story can be seen in the context of many news stories and studies that have shown that low-wage workers employed by corporations like Walmart make so little money that they’re forced to turn to government assistance. Not only do these workers make a pittance, they are often scheduled sporadically, which results in stress and underemployment. Minimum wage laws in the United States are due for reform and labour laws and practices should be changed so it’s easier to unionize all types of workplaces.,Canadian couple has Russian adoption blocked,Vladimir Putin is at it again. As if his domestic anti-LGBT crackdown wasn’t enough, Putin may have banned adoptions to Canada on the basis that same-sex marriage is legal in this country. A Canadian couple has presumed this to be the case after their adoption was blocked without explanation. While the adoption process isn’t perfect, countries should not be discriminated against based on same-sex marriage laws. Gay marriage isn’t a threat to children, and childless couples shouldn’t be used as political leverage. \t,Laurels,Queen’s implements ConfidenceLine,Queen’s has created a 24-hour, third-party phone line that its employees can call to report workplace misconduct. While Queen’s undoubtedly made the right decision to implement this service, it would have been best if it had already existed. However, since these types of lines are not ubiquitous at universities across Canada, it could be claimed that Queen’s has exceeded expectations for workplace accountability.,Organic garbage bins rolling out on campus,New waste stations, some featuring organic waste bins, have been introduced on campus. It’s great to see a student initiative that’s dedicated to reducing waste, as these new bins will remind students about the necessity of recycling and composting on a day-to-day basis. AMS Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainability, Colin Robinson, struggled to convince a hesitant Queen’s bureaucracy to make this change. We all owe a debt to the efforts of the CES and everyone else struggling to keep environmental issues on the agenda.,Post-doctoral fellows get a favourable agreement,Everyone at Queen’s should be happy that our post-docs negotiated an agreement that included a base salary and increased benefits, including access to Queen’s dental plan. It’s ridiculous that it took the administration 18 months to settle with this group. Post-doctoral fellows do a lot of the work that maintains Queen’s special reputation for research. Their strategy of shaming Queen’s by handing out “worst employer” flyers on campus was particularly effective.

However, it’s important to discuss the possible drawbacks of the product and explore how they fit into a wider analysis of sexual assault.,It’s not clear when a woman would wear these shorts. While our culture promotes the image of a rapist as a random attacker, most rapes are committed by someone that the victim knows. The premise that someone would wear the shorts all the time seems impractical. How many pairs would they have to own?,Some have suggested the shorts would be most effective if the victim was unconscious. However, the vast majority of sexual assault victims are conscious when they are attacked.,The group developing the shorts cites studies which show that “resistance increases the chance of avoiding a completed rape without making the victim more likely to be physically injured”. These are fairly tenuous grounds on which to promote the shorts, as the studies in question are based on cases that are wildly divergent from what’s at issue here: an unanticipated physical barrier.,The issue of accessibility is also important to consider, as the shorts themselves are expensive to produce. This is particularly disconcerting as they’re likely to be out of reach for those with lower incomes. Those who live places in the world where sexual assault is most prevalent would be the least likely to acquire this clothing item.,These shorts should be available to anyone who wants to use them, as feeling safe is a central consideration when dealing with sexual assault.

However, this sentiment isn’t globally-held.,Russia is set to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018, and we should be asking ourselves if they’re culturally prepared enough to deserve the honour.,Institutionalized racism still rears its ugly head at the club level in Russian football. Recently, Russian teams have come under fire for the xenophobic behaviour displayed by their fans during games.,There have been reports of racist monkey chants directed at black players, bananas being hurled at players and the brandishing of banners carrying neo-Nazi symbols.,While the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has measures in place to combat these attitudes, only soft punishments have been given thus far, while club officials tend to avoid acknowledging any real problems.,Monetary fines and stadium lockouts have been ineffective in dealing with the root of the issue, often punishing large numbers of fans who haven’t participated in the chants.,In May, FIFA’s worldwide governing body agreed to impose stricter sanctions on fan behaviour during competitions. These penalties may include banishing clubs from top tournaments if their fans overstep the mark.,While imposing graver sanctions for racist behaviour during games is a great initiative, we need to hold FIFA accountable for following through. Hard lines need to be drawn fast to change the behaviour of fans before 2018.,While admittedly Russia isn’t the only country experiencing such challenges, the spotlight is already on them in the lead up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Men have issues of their own and will benefit from an institution geared to their needs. Feminists should embrace this development as it will mean more dialogue and a progression towards gender equality.,Women still have a lower social position than men in Canadian society and there are parts of the world where women are second-class citizens lacking basic rights. For these reasons, women still deserve the majority of attention and resources when it comes to gender issues.,However, men have their own genuine concerns. They’re more likely to commit suicide and more likely to abuse alcohol.They deal with mental and physical health problems in different ways than women and are more reluctant to get professional help for both. Men are also often treated unfairly in the court system during divorce and custody battles.,At a more theoretical level, men are coping with stereotypical notions of masculinity at a time when expectations for male behaviour are changing at a faster pace than ever before.,This confluence of issues calls for a “safe space” to discuss them. Most importantly, a men’s centre could help foster healthy dialogue with feminists on topics like gender equality.,The risk that an extreme “men’s rights” or otherwise anti-woman faction could gain sway in a men’s centre is plausible and this possibility should be guarded against with vigilance.

By doing so, she argues, women are putting themselves in high-risk situations that are more likely to result in sexual assault.,This article reflects Wente’s regular tendency to sensationalize, resulting in an oversimplified, disingenuous and underdeveloped argument.,One of articles’ most glaring missteps is its disproportionate focus on the actions of women. Wente begins by regurgitating the same warning that many university-aged women have heard a handful of times: you shouldn’t get too drunk around young men or you might end up getting sexually assaulted.,The premise that the consumption of alcohol is the catalyst in the vast majority of campus sexual assaults is tenuous at best. There’s no doubt that sexual assaults would continue after an end to binge drinking, as the underlying gender dynamics and power imbalances would remain. Wente reduces a fairly complicated conversation to a piece of impractical advice.,Young men should also take offence to Wente’s column, as she generalizes their actions to the point that they come across as rapists-in-waiting.,It’s unfortunate that Wente goes on to undermine those who insist that “rape culture” exists. Feminists who talk about “rape culture” often advocate a male focused approach to sexual assault prevention. The idea that we should counsel young men about sexual assault is one that Wente could stand to engage with.,By comparing rape to other crimes like mugging, Wente excludes herself from rational debate. Taking someone’s wallet isn’t the same as violating their body. Anyone making that comparison isn’t attempting to discuss the topic seriously.,Everyone owes themselves a basic level of vigilance and responsibility in order to avoid dangerous situations. This is so self-evident that it shouldn’t be central to this conversation. To prevent sexual assault, the main focus should be on the actions of rapists. Women shouldn’t be forced to significantly change their behaviour due to the threat of attack.,By excluding any serious analysis of wider cultural sexism, Wente maximizes the blame placed on sexual assault victims. She insults the intelligence of young men and young women alike. She sensationalizes, and therefore narrows her argument to the point of absurdity.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Devs dilemma","url":"/story/2013-11-28/editorials/devs-dilemma/","date":"November 28, 2013","content":"Apathetic has become the adjective of my generation.,Coming to Queen’s, I didn’t expect to become apathetic about my degree but, sadly, that’s what happened.,I fell in love with DEVS 100 in first year.

Most of the departments that carry DEVS eligible courses, however, don’t save spaces for DEVS students during the first round of course selection.,Instead, I’m forced to wait until their department majors fill them, and thus have to settle with courses I don’t really need, to get a degree I’ve now found out I don’t really want.,A university education is supposed to leave me feeling fulfilled. Nearing my last semester at Queen’s, I’m left with a bad taste in my mouth.,For a degree that should be training students to apply learned material to life, it’s breeding a generation of graduates that haven’t built upon their knowledge of previous years.

Social class is a much larger part of a Queen’s experience than many would like to admit.,It’s important to note that Canada is much less economically polarized than the US, and Canadian universities usually draw students from a variety of backgrounds. In general, Canada does a better job of “leveling the playing field” than many other countries.,Despite these efforts, however, Queen’s remains a largely white school with a substantial percentage of fairly affluent students. While the average student may not fit that description, and individual experiences vary greatly, Queen’s prestigious reputation combines with its demographics to create a campus environment that can alienate and stigmatize those from lower economic classes.,Queen’s culture of class hierarchy is apparent when many students talk about non-student Kingston residents. While it’s occasionally used in a more benign manner, the word “townie” can be seen as a class-based slur.,The University may provide more opportunities for student employment than other schools, but the job demand is high and no one is guaranteed one.,Low-income students are sometimes forced to forgo prestigious positions in student government because the pay is not high enough for the time commitment.,Students who hold a job have substantially less time to socialize, further alienating them from their wealthier peers. Job or not, many simply find themselves excluded from Queen’s active nightlife.,As if that wasn’t enough, students also have to cope with a campus culture that expects fashionable consumption of name-brand consumer products and the ability to shell out thousands of dollars for long weekend trips or weeklong vacations.,Economic disparity is a fact of life, but Queen’s is particularly notable for its expectations and its culture of class hierarchy.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Frown due to Homecoming shakedown","url":"/story/2013-11-28/editorials/frown-due-homecoming-shakedown/","date":"November 28, 2013","content":"The University’s plan to pay the City of Kingston $100,000 a year for the next three years in order to cover “policing costs” is a mistake.,While the City and local residents have legitimate concerns about street parties, the payments set a bad precedent and were determined in an unfortunate political context.,Why should Queen’s pay for the costs associated with something it has consistently tried to curtail? A large percentage of Homecoming and St. Patrick’s Day revelers aren’t Queen’s students and only a small percentage of Queen’s students actually participate.,A contribution of $100,000 per year when total police costs for this year’s Homecoming were $104,000 is ridiculous.,However you look at it, the $100,000 is excessive. Why is this new scheme being implemented in the wake of what was universally considered to be a relatively smooth Homecoming?,Another major problem with the arrangement is its lack of transparency. Students already pay a huge amount in tuition and fees, and we’re not sure where exactly this money is coming from. It’s Principal Daniel Woolf’s responsibility to make this clear to students.,In addition to being opaque, the agreement sets an awkward precedent. What happens if the costs of policing St. Patrick’s Day and Homecoming change in the coming years? Will Queen’s match the new costs in three year intervals? The City can’t be allowed to treat short-term fluctuations in student behaviour as a cash cow.,Instead of being opportunistic, the City should embrace Homecoming as an event that benefits the local economy.,That said, if Queen’s wants Kingston to embrace Homecoming, then it should continue to search for alternative solutions. Queen’s should consider sanctioning the Homecoming street party and managing it, as this would remove ambiguity about responsibility and would be less expensive than the current arrangement.,Even if Queen’s doesn’t directly sanction street parties, now that it’s effectively paying for them, will police behaviour change? The possibility that Kingston Police might curtail their sometimes rough and arbitrary treatment of students is a welcome one.,More than anything, this agreement should be seen as an attempt to pacify relations with Kingston’s mayor. For Mayor Mark Gerretsen, bad town-gown relations are good politics. In the lead up to the 2014 municipal elections, Gerretsen will probably tout this shakedown as a major achievement. While these exorbitant payments might buy a stalemate between Queen’s and the City, they don’t solve the underlying problems.,Principal Woolf shouldn’t have given in to Gerretsen’s demands for compensation.

Both losses may be attributed to the fact that OPIRG has had to contend with NOPIRG, a campaign formed by some students opposed to their endeavour.,NOPIRG’s campaign has been misleading in the past, but the fight over OPIRG’s funding reached an ugly low when an anonymous flyer was distributed to mailboxes in the Student Ghetto in the lead-up to the vote. The flyer accused OPIRG of “anti-Semitism” and “violence”. NOPIRG leaders claim their campaign had no involvement with the distribution of the flyer.,It’s unfortunate that OPIRG lost their opt-out fee, as they are a constructive presence on campus and no more political than many other organizations that have similar fees. However, OPIRG hasn’t advocated their position effectively — they could stand to be more transparent and actively address NOPIRG’s arguments.,The tactic of last-second smears before elections is one that should be condemned. Those who made the flyers should be ashamed, as OPIRG’s inability to respond to these accusations brings the election results into question.,Since OPIRG’s out-optable fee was voted down, it’s tempting to condemn Queens’s students for falling for NOPIRG’s tactics, in addition to the exaggerated information on the anonymous flyer.,However, only 15.8 per cent of eligible students actually voted in the referendum, meaning that either NOPIRG managed to rally a small minority of students to their side, or most students were already opposed to OPIRG’s fee.,OPIRG members have been effectively intimidated from taking a stand, as no one likes to be smeared.,That said, OPIRG could stand to be more transparent and could actively promote their work, much of which is fairly benign.,OPIRG should have an opt-out fee.

Handing out tickets en masse, including large fines, is a particularly uncharitable and ineffective way to actually reduce infractions and increase road safety.,Periodic crackdowns might be a good way of causing a stir and temporarily raising awareness, but 42 tickets and 18 warnings in one day appears to be an opportunistic “cash cow” more than a genuine attempt to make residents bicycle lawfully. Consistent enforcement of the rules of the road is always preferable.,A better strategy would have been to make a display of issuing warnings at an earlier juncture and then return at a later date to ticket those who were still committing infractions.,A campaign to highlight “responsible cycling” habits is warranted, however. Many cyclists act somewhat arrogant and tend to think that the rules of the road don’t apply to them.,Although Ontario and Kingston should consider updating their traffic laws to include things like the “Idaho stop” where cyclists can treat stop signs as yields, there’s no good excuse for not bicycling within the law as it exists.,While reckless bicycling shouldn’t be tolerated, KPF could have acted with greater discretion when doling out fines as big as $325. That’s a lot of money on a student budget, and the recipient of such a fine is more likely to feel anger than guilt or apprehension.,While KPF was right to issue some tickets, their tactics need re-examining.

After all, attending to a full to-do list, packed schedule and landslide of messages can’t mean you’re unsuccessful or overlooked. Being busy, therefore, must mean you’re doing something right.,Until very recently, I’d always loved keeping busy. My childhood and adolescence were absorbed with extra-curricular activities — conditioning conducive to joining an overachieving Queen’s population.,I was led to believe that busyness is synonymous with happiness.,I kept getting busier and busier, assuming I was doing myself a favour.,Until one day, amidst my feverish multi-tasking and over-zealous smartphone usage, I caught a glimpse of a woman sitting complacently on a wooden bench, reading a magazine, and sipping an iced tea.,That’s when I realized it.,Being busy doesn’t mean being happy, nor does it necessarily mean being productive.,I’ve spent an unreasonable number of hours detailing to-do lists when I could have actually done things.,Scheduling every second of my day isn’t a greater achievement than if I were to opt for a coffee break or enjoy a long lunch with a friend.,Sifting through emails seconds before going to bed isn’t accomplishing too much either, save insomnia.,As a wise teacher once told me, “you always have time for what you make time for.”,Perhaps the art of prioritization lies in a more laissez-faire approach. Important things will get done because they must, while others will fall away, revealing how trivial they always were.,Priorities define our lives, but I’m not sure being busy should be one of them. There are far more worthwhile ways to spend one’s time.,I no longer believe in being busy. I believe in prioritizing the things I love to do, and the people I love. Because it’s a choice.

They chuckle and close their browser, passing it off as another peculiar Internet phenomenon.,Ryan may be embracing his momentary fame — but not every person can be expected to welcome this type of unintended publicity or attention, which can have repercussions into one’s offline life.,Ghyslain Raza, better known as the “Star War Kid”, illustrates the resounding psychological and emotional implications of having one’s embarrassing home video go viral.,Raza changed schools after incessant harassment and humiliation, including some people encouraging him to commit suicide, demonstrating the harmful nature of sharing implicitly private content online.,Oftentimes, viewers discount the trauma and repercussions faced by the individual.

But for introverts like me, who need to “recharge” at the end of a long day, this prospect can be exhausting.,Though the ratio of introverts to extroverts is around 50/50, few people would admit they’d rather stay in and read a book.,In Western society, it seems like extroverted people are automatically accepted and embraced, while those who prefer to keep their thoughts to themselves are regarded as strange or suspicious.,Last year, I experienced this stigma firsthand during one of my psychology tutorials. The topic that week was personality, and my group had been asked to put different personal characteristics into one of three categories: good, bad or neutral.,I was both surprised and a bit saddened to note that my group members placed traits such as “quiet” or “subdued” in the “bad” category. Why were these traits lumped into the same category as far more destructive ones, such as “violent” or “unstable”?,I believe people with these supposedly bad characteristics are essential to our society. Introverts require less stimulation than extroverts, meaning they’re highly skilled at focusing on complex problems.,Many people considered to be geniuses — from Newton to Chopin to Einstein — were introverts. These types of people are typically more deliberate and think things through more carefully. Relatively unmotivated by wealth and fame, they derive their ambitions from reaching their carefully-planned goals.,Still, many introverts — myself included — tend to feel guilty when we take some time for ourselves.

But, the question remains, where do I belong?,In 2010, Statistics Canada reported that more than 340,000 children are a part of a mixed-race family.,With these numbers growing, and other standards of identity being blurred, attempts to place individuals into single categories of gender, race or sexual orientation should be a thing of the past.,It’s sometimes unsettling when people ask me where I’m from. While it might seem like an innocent question, it makes me feel like I have to accept a racial label. I’ve completed many surveys where I’ve had to state my race as “other”.,It’s especially sickening when I’ve been told that I am “lucky” to pass as white. Some people feel comfortable saying racist comments in reaction to my appearance. I’ve been told that I’m “pretty, for a brown girl”.,Looking “white” does not mean I am okay with racism.,Although I’d never say that I’m thoroughly Indian, I grew up with a heavier South Asian upbringing.

The results of the autocomplete function, according to Google, takes into account several factors, including the popularity of the search term.,Some of the results, such as “women should be slaves”, “women should be in the kitchen” and “women cannot be trusted”, provide a healthy amount of shock value to this ad campaign.,The idea is simple: women are silenced by sexism. This approach to confronting prejudice is successful in its symbolism and deeper-implied meanings. We live in a modern era of digital technology but outdated views of sex and gender still haunt us.,Typing “women shouldn’t” into Google may be a slightly leading search, yet there still isn’t any excuse for what pops up. Typing “men shouldn’t” yields entirely different types of results.,While some of the suggestions for “men shouldn’t” are harmful, as they imply masculine stereotypes, they aren’t hateful like those that appear for women.,While it’s possible that many of the people searching these terms didn’t intend harm, the general trend is still unsettling.,There’s still a long way to go if we want to achieve worldwide gender equality. Our cognizance of the oppression women have historically faced, and the ongoing oppression that women live with today, should spark even more resistance to the same old sexist tendencies that are being propagated in new ways.,A noted problem with the internet is its propensity to cement prejudice by directing users to content that agrees with their ideology.

While it would be ideal if Queen’s athletes could look to full stands during every contest, ultimately, there are good reasons why this doesn’t happen.,Queen’s reputation for school spirit might lead someone to assume that the vast majority of sporting events on campus are heavily attended. The reality is slightly more disappointing.,Attendance looks especially sparse at many football and hockey games. Before dismissing students, however, anyone weighing in on this topic should think critically about its context.,Canada in general is not a sports-mad country like the United States. Only one professional sports league that operates in Canada consistently sells out games: the NHL.,If anything, Queen’s is above average in terms of attendance when compared to other Canadian campuses. We have higher than average attendance for football games; and volleyball and basketball games often get sizeable crowds.,Quite frankly, there’s nothing that makes sports more important than any other campus subculture. Where’s the annual handwringing over the fact that the theatrical productions staged in Kingston and on Queen’s campus don’t have greater attendance? Football games shouldn’t take precedence over everything else.,If Queen’s had better-located athletic facilities, then crowds at sporting events would undoubtedly be larger. Going off-campus to the Memorial Centre or to a crumbling Richardson Stadium greatly discourages attendance.,However, Queen’s shouldn’t necessarily make fixing these issues a central goal.

In the US, the Obama administration has cracked down on whistleblowers and conducted shocking surveillance of news media. In Canada, Prime Minister Harper seems to have an adversarial relationship with the news media. Harper strictly limits media access to his government, and his control has only become more draconian over time. After he attempted to limit media access to a recent speech he made, almost all news organizations boycotted the event. Following this boycott, the Conservative party sent out a fundraising email saying “You won’t believe what the Press Gallery just did in Ottawa”. Press freedom is vital to democracy. Politicians always resist transparency, so information needs to be forced out of them. While Harper’s strict limits on media access can’t necessarily be spun as an issue of press freedom, the Obama administrations intrusions are truly frightening.,Three Canadian National train derailments this month,Train derailments are the natural byproduct of increased rail traffic. In particular, more and more oil is being shipped by rail as oil pipelines are being held up in regulatory proceedings. While oil transport by pipeline is allegedly safer than transport by train, both are far from safe as oil spills from pipelines are often much larger than those produced in rail accidents. When it comes to new pipelines, the public gets a much greater say in terms of what is being transported and when. As the global climate warms, conversations about different types of oil transportation will pale in the face of a much more important debate: why we are still transporting oil at all?,Middle school student suspended for drawing picture of bomb,A 13-year-old boy in South Carolina was suspended from school after he drew a picture of a cartoon bomb. The boy, who has an autism spectrum disorder, wasn't violent in any way, although the school alleges he made “threatening comments”. Compounding this sad reality is the ongoing fad of “zero tolerance” behavioural standards. These unreasonable expectations result in grand overreactions where children get major punishments that are entirely ineffective. If a child is sent home from school after drawing a bomb, what is he or she supposed to learn from that experience? A genuine creative education would be one where children are encouraged to release whatever might be preoccupying them so that it can be dealt with in a healthy social or educational environment.,Laurels,Success for sporting Gaels, especially against the Gryphons,The Queen’s Gaels have had a good run as of late. It was a great week for both rugby squads. The men’s rugby team secured a perfect regular season and is marching towards a second straight Ontario title. Women’s rugby has earned an opportunity to meet Guelph in the OUA final after a tough loss to the same team in last year’s championship game. Queen’s football has clinched a bye into the semi-finals after defeating Guelph and shattering that team’s perfect season. Since all of these wins came on Homecoming weekend, it was a great time for alumni to reclaim ties with Gaels sports teams and see the strength of some of this year’s programs.,Photo series shows regular men posing as underwear models,The photo series entitled “Real Men vs. Underwear Models” by Jenny Francis and daily tabloid The Sun is a step in the right direction for men and women hoping to understand male body image. “Real” may have been a poor choice of wording, as there’s no true “real” body type. Still, the series is a provocative juxtaposition between the “real” men and the underwear models, and also between the series itself and similar campaigns that have featured women. It’s understood that women face huge pressures to look a certain way in our society, but it’s less well-recognized that men face similar pressures. While women mostly focus on looking skinnier, men often obsess over having the right muscle build. The ongoing rise in male anorexia is the type of development that should provoke us to undermine strict beauty standards for males and for females.,Canada is the most educated country in the world,A recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey places Canada at the top spot as measured by the proportion of adults with tertiary education.

While this statement may have some alienating effects, it’s simply an honest telling of the Globe’s longstanding tendency to cater towards a wealthier and more educated readership.,These are trying times for print journalism. Every newspaper is tinkering with different methods of garnering advertising money, readership and online subscribers. The fact that the Globe is solidifying its reputation as a newspaper for “elite” readers is a pragmatic business decision.,If the Globe was Canada’s sole news service, this announcement would be much more problematic. However, there are newspapers and news outlets that cater to many different socioeconomic classes and political persuasions. As long as there’s still a wide variety of news offered to Canadians, then a single company’s business decision should not be cause for alarm.,The Globe’s announcement has some awkward implications, however. Readers who don’t make over $100,000 in a year might feel slighted. The large number of people who work for the Globe and don’t make enough money to be in its ideal readership demographic may resent their position. It’s also possible that the Globe’s editorial bias and news coverage could shift as its readership narrows. However, it has always been a somewhat elitist centre-right outlet, so any shift won’t be substantial.,If anything, it’s good that the Globe is being transparent and direct about a marketing strategy that it has employed for some time now.

However, ignorance shouldn’t be an excuse.,When we sit down at our laptops for that essay all-nighter, we shouldn’t regard the final result as the desperate scribblings of a half-conscious brain, but rather as a work of art — a complex tapestry of connotation, implication, careful word choice and, above all, syntax."},{"title":"Queen’s rep gets gut check","url":"/story/2013-09-27/editorials/queens-rep-gets-gut-check/","date":"September 27, 2013","content":"Queen’s recently received its poorest ranking ever from the Quacquarelli Symonds’ (QS) World University Rankings. While not a cause for panic, this new low is representative of a general downward trend in international reputation that the school administration is reluctant to acknowledge.,Queen’s standing in the QS rankings has fallen consistently over time and also recently dropped in the Times Higher Education assessment. The fact that multiple rating systems have Queen’s placing worse year after year isn’t a coincidence.,Those who are critical of international ranking systems insist they are mostly meaningless and based on faulty criteria. Predictably, Vice-Provost (International) Jim Lee played down this most recent report, saying that the “reputation” criteria was determined by individual academics who were asked to list what they believed to be the top universities.,It’s curious that the current administration would be so glib about Queen’s declining reputation, as it doesn’t bode well in relation to its larger plans for internationalization. Queen’s isn’t an incredibly well-known school internationally. As such, being able to fall back on a good general reputation in international surveys would be ideal. For better or for worse, university applicants often look at international rankings to get a vague picture of how much a degree from a specific institution is worth.,For the time being, Queen’s will maintain its reputation within Canada as a top-tier university. However, this fact, coupled with a fairly insular campus culture, can often lead to complacency about our state of affairs. Needless to say, Queen’s can’t afford to be complacent during a period of globalization and competition.,International rankings will continue to come out and Queen’s will probably continue to decline in standing. The administration will undoubtedly remain guarded about the topic, but this defensiveness won’t help raise our profile.,International rankings are not a catch-all for what makes a university great. Queen’s students are still right to think fairly highly of their university. However, the fact that our administration doesn’t acknowledge the decline isn’t a good sign.

Woolf passed out literature which contained information about official Homecoming events and the history of the reunion weekend. While cynical people will question the effectiveness of his strategy, going door-to-door is a better way of provoking good student behaviour than anything else that has been attempted.,It’s fun to speculate about the motivation behind Woolf’s personal appeal to Ghetto residents. It could have been an act of desperation in advance of one of his most important weekends as Queen’s Principal.,It could have been a public relations tactic to appease Homecoming’s critics, complete with an earnest Twitter picture of the act. It also could have been a genuine attempt to remind students of the historical and communal importance of Homecoming. Woolf hasn’t given us many reasons to be pessimistic about his motives, so we’re leaning towards the latter.,If Principal Woolf arrived on your doorstep and talked in a reasonable tone about the importance of a smooth Homecoming weekend, you would feel a little bit guilty about your plans for a raging kegger, wouldn’t you? In that sense, Woolf’s tactic might be marginally effective. A face-to-face meeting with the Principal will always mean more than a well-written but often ignored email.,Woolf’s approach is much more positive and edifying than the AMS’s “let's not fuck it up” campaign. The student government’s video which featured numerous student talking heads telling the viewer not to “fuck it up” had confusing moments. Surely our student government could have come up with a more extensive and creative campaign.,Principal Woolf has effectively put the ball in our court. His door-to-door strategy has removed the barrier between students and the administration, and by having conversations with students, he’s treating them like adults. Woolf carried newsletters outlining the history of Homecoming, the implication being that this weekend, for better or for worse, we can make history.,This editorial has been updated to reflect the following correction: The AMS video's message was \"let's not fuck it up\", not \"don't fuck it up\".

Gerretsen could have used what was a relatively smooth Homecoming weekend to improve town-gown relations. Instead, the Mayor put his foot in his mouth by being overly critical of the crowd on Aberdeen St., disrespecting Queen’s Principal Daniel Woolf and being generally paternalistic and immature.,Gerretsen is a public figure paid to represent the residents of Kingston. As such, we expect him to conduct himself professionally. Homecoming weekend is a critical time for him to fulfill his role, as the mayor’s leadership is required to mediate between stakeholders. Instead of providing leadership, Gerretsen acted like a petty outsider.,Queen’s students, the AMS and the Kingston Police Force got along fairly well throughout the weekend, while Gerretsen stood back and took potshots on Twitter. He seemed dedicated to aggravating divisions between students and the city on a weekend when there was no good reason to do so.,The Aberdeen St. gathering was subdued compared to previous years, despite Gerretsen’s attempts to exaggerate its size. On Saturday night, Gerretsen tweeted at Woolf saying: “I am standing at William and Aberdeen. I have two words for you: NOT GOOD”. Making a show by tweeting at the Principal is bad form - surely Woolf deserves more respect after having made efforts to ensure a positive Homecoming.,It seems that only in Kingston would a mayor make this much of a fuss about a relatively small street party. Gerretsen’s tweets make more sense in light of next year’s municipal elections. Presumably, the Mayor has calculated that Homecoming’s critics vote en masse, while student voter turnout is low.,Gerretsen should be embarrassed by how he’s been perpetuating historically tense town-gown relations. How can he demand good behaviour from students if he doesn’t consider us worthy of respect?,Vladimir Putin nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,Vladimir Putin’s nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize by an advocacy group is a symbol of the award’s continuing irrelevance. While Putin played a significant role in putting a peaceful solution on the table, in regards to Syria’s chemical weapons, this isn’t enough to warrant his nomination for the Peace Prize. Putin’s Russia is extremely oppressive and has an aggressive foreign policy of its own. It’s questionable whether we should lend the Peace Prize significance; it seems to be a flawed award with a flawed nominating process.,Northwestern journalism program facilitates unpaid internships,Students at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism have been exploited in an unpaid internship program. The university offered its students to major news organizations knowing that they wouldn’t be paid. The university collected tuition from the students as well as fees from the news organizations that they were provided to. This is a depressing state of affairs for anyone who aspires to be a journalist. A profession that demands integrity is now being perverted by the institutions that are charged with maintaining it. It’s come to the point where only those from high-income families have a hope of beginning a career in journalism. Reform is desperately needed in an industry where exploitative situations have become all too common.,Laurels,Homecoming a moderate success,Queen’s Homecoming was mostly successful despite our Mayor’s best attempts to portray it negatively. Student behaviour was fairly tame, with few major incidents of misconduct. Police and students were largely cordial with each other, and the Aberdeen St. gathering wrapped up before 2 a.m. Some police tactics were overly rough, however. There’s no need to violently throw anyone into a paddy wagon - behaviour observed by some of our reporters who were on-scene. Aggressive searches are also unnecessary. It’s a shame that the few students who threw beer bottles legitimized these heavy-handed police tactics in the eyes of Homecoming’s critics. That said, any student or police indiscretion was completely overshadowed by the united effort to clean up Aberdeen St. on Sunday morning. Students, alumni and other Kingston residents teamed up with the AMS’s Student Maintenance and Resource Team (SMART), leaving Aberdeen St. spotless.,Prank Fire alarm pulls decreasing due to awareness program,As of last Thursday, there had been no malicious fire alarm pulls so far this year in Queen’s residences. For students that were in residence three, four or five years ago, this might be an astonishing fact. It’s well-known that Kingston Fire and Rescue services reroute resources to university residences when a fire alarm is pulled, thus increasing the response time for other calls. In 2010, one such occurrence resulted in a fatality. In the aftermath of that incident, Residence Life instituted a program to inform students about the consequences of pulling fire alarms. The program includes new residents watching a video about the fatal incident in 2010. It’s nice to see that frosh are taking note and changing their behaviour.,Student and alumni tree planting,The new tree planting initiative headed by the AMS Commission of Environment and Sustainability is a positive development. The effort, which involved both University and local resident associations, was a great way to put a positive spin on what had the potential to be a very rocky weekend. It’s also nice to see something that’s environmentally-focused during a time when environmental initiatives are on the backburner. Hopefully these types of partnerships will continue to bloom., - Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Respect for Ryp","url":"/story/2013-10-08/editorials/respect-ryp/","date":"October 8, 2013","content":"There’s an argument to be made for removing fighting from hockey, but using Rick Rypien’s death to further that position is shameful.,Rypien played in 119 games with the Vancouver Canucks during his NHL career, serving as a fourth-line forward. As a hard-nosed physical player, a part of his job description was to fight from time to time.,While he won a fair number of battles on the ice, the one fight he never won was his battle with depression. On Aug. 15, 2011, Rypien took his own life at the age of 27.,Since then, almost every anti-fighting proponent has tried to pin his death on fighting. It seems like every time something controversial happens during a fight at the NHL level ―such as the recent injury to George Parros of the Montreal Canadiens― sports writers are quick to use Rypien as an example of the dangers of fighting.,Using Rypien’s death in this manner is short-sighted, ignorant and simply wrong. It’s a perfect example of cherry-picking facts to suit the story.,Rypien had been suffering from depression for over ten years at the time of his death. This fact is never brought up when anti-fighting articles mention him, because it wouldn’t fit with the narrative. Instead, the only explanation for his suicide and his struggles with depression is fighting.,Rypien’s family and close friends don’t believe fighting caused his depression or led to his death, so why do people insist on pinning the blame on it?,Doing so is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever suffered from depression. Instead of opening doors to help people who may be in a similar situation to Rypien’s, these articles trivialize depression.,His death should be used to encourage discussion about depression and to help end the stigma attached to it, especially in the athletic community.,For those suffering with mental illness, including Rypien, the associated stigma makes it hard to admit to having a problem. Often, those with mental illnesses are afraid of being seen as a burden, or as weak. Rypien’s story could be a huge benefit for those with depression if it’s told in the correct way.,There should be a robust debate about fighting in hockey, but using his death as a tool in that argument is simply wrong."},{"title":"Issue 11: Darts & Laurels","url":"/story/2013-10-01/editorials/issue-11-darts-laurels/","date":"October 1, 2013","content":"Darts,University of Toronto professor makes misguided remarks,David Gilmour, a University of Toronto literature professor, sparked controversy with remarks he made during a recent interview with a literary magazine. Gilmour said that he only teaches books by “serious heterosexual guys” and that none of his favorite authors happened to be “Chinese, or women.” Gilmour’s comments are misguided because he has a responsibility to teach students using diverse sources and materials. The class in question, “Love, Sex and Death in Modern Short Fiction”, is a general course and therefore, calls for the inclusion of female authors. However, while Gilmour’s comments were regrettable, the backlash he’s been subjected to is far from perfect. The current tendency on university campuses is to scrutinize those who aren’t strictly politically correct, and in this situation, unfortunately, criticism has been overblown. Gilmour should continue to exercise his freedom as an academic but should be wary of potential repercussions. He should take more discretion with his comments and have a greater consideration of his responsibility to students.,Horrific labour conditions reported in Qatar,Migrant workers in Qatar have been subject to horrendous labour practices and conditions in the lead-up to the 2022 World Cup, which they will be hosting. Many workers have died thus far, with reports of forced work in extreme heat and other egregious abuses. The fact that the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) would give the World Cup hosting duties to a country with such terrible labour practices is a testament to that organization’s deep-seated corruption. FIFA should take significant action in light of how labourers are treated in Qatar, but no one should hold their breath. What is supposed to be global celebration of athletic meritocracy will now be a very political symbol of exploitation and misery.,Safety audit data analysis not completed as planned,The AMS’s failure to see its promise of a “campus safety audit” to fruition is another reminder of the tendency that political representatives have to overreach. The audit ended up being completed by campus security after two student volunteers did not make much progress. What’s worse is that the current and former Municipal Affairs Commissioners only revealed publically that the project would not be fully completed when they were asked 11 months later by the Journal. Why was there no public announcement that plans had changed? Student governments, like all governments, should be actively transparent.,Laurels,Alternative beauty in fashion,A recent fashion show run by designer Rick Owens was intended to push boundaries, and it succeeded. The designer hired “step-dancers” from American colleges to perform and walk the runway in his new line. The overall presentation was theatrical and expressive as the dancers put on facial expressions and did movements that aren’t seen at an typical fashion show. The models themselves undermined the racist beauty ideal expected in the fashion industry as they were a racially diverse group, a large percentage being African-American. This type of exciting performance, which incorporates new elements and new performers, probably won’t catch on in the fashion world, and that’s a shame. It’s likely that Rick Owens felt comfortable differing from the norm because he’s such a prominent designer ― others likely won’t take similar risks.,AMS raises enrolment concerns,The AMS’s enrolment policy paper is a positive addition to the discussion of this very important topic. Among other things, the paper recommends that new residences should deal with the overflow from overburdened old residences. This is a critical recommendation and it’s to the AMS’s credit that they called a special Assembly so that the paper could be discussed at length. The AMS should continue to be proactive on the issue going forward. Increased enrolment is to be expected, but it should be sustainable. Queen’s will have difficulty maintaining its high reputation if it ceases to be a mid-size school. Solving our financial problems by simply increasing enrolment isn’t an effective long-term strategy.,New physical literacy program for local children,The City of Kingston has received funding for a two-year “physical literacy project”. The funding will be used to host programs where children will learn about “developing the ability to perform basic movements such as running, jumping and throwing.” This initiative is a good development as it will set the foundation for a greater overall level of fitness and a “more equal playing field” among children. It’s sad that we live in an age where many children live sedentary lifestyles; this program may not have been necessary 50 years ago. Regardless, it’s good that the government is aware of the need to emphasize physical fitness at an early age. Because these programs will be available to both girls and boys, girls who might shy away from physical activity or have parents who attempt to deter their participation in sports will now have an early opportunity to get physically active.,- Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"A call against hate crimes","url":"/story/2013-10-18/editorials/call-against-hate-crimes/","date":"October 18, 2013","content":"On Sunday, it’s alleged that six Queen’s students were harassed, and one student assaulted, by a group of young men in Kingston. Due to the nature of the attack and the fact that the victims are visible minorities, Kingston Police have said the assault is a hate crime.,It’s good that the individuals accused of carrying out this crime are the main focus of attention in its aftermath. However, the Kingston community as a whole has a ways to go in terms of accepting diversity. The Queen’s campus is no exception.,Kingston Police should be commended for not hesitating to label the assault a hate crime and for quickly apprehending and charging suspects in the case. This swift action means that those who are similarly victimized will be more comfortable going to police with any allegations of criminal activity.,Unfortunately, there are far too many people who have stories about racist treatment in Kingston and at Queen’s. These anecdotes and Kingston’s high rate of hate crimes combine to paint an ugly picture.,For that reason, we hope this event will renew a conversation about how people of different backgrounds are treated in Kingston.,Queen’s students shouldn’t use this event as an opportunity to furnish the stereotype of an ignorant “townie”. There’s a recent history of racist incidents at Queen’s which include Islamophobic verbal assaults and vandalism.,The fact that these incidents seem to reoccur may have something to do with the reality of the demographics of Kingston and Queen’s. Both are largely white and fairly conservative. Racism might have more staying power in these environments.,There are some encouraging signs, however. In the aftermath of an incident this summer where a gay couple received threats of violence, the Kingston and Queen’s communities rallied around them in solidarity. This is the type of event that sows hope for the future.,There’s still a lot of progress to be made in Kingston. Regular people and city leadership should speak in unison against racism. Police should prosecute hate crimes aggressively to deter the small handful of individuals who would actually commit these crimes. We should all remain vigilant, as the behaviour seen this week is completely unacceptable."},{"title":"Culture clash over kid’s care","url":"/story/2013-09-27/editorials/culture-clash-over-kids-care/","date":"September 27, 2013","content":"Two Winnipeg foster parents will soon learn whether or not they can continue caring for the child who has been with them for two years.,Because the child in question is Métis and the parents are Filipino, the Métis Child and Family Services Authority has attempted to block the adoption in favour of finding the child a “culturally appropriate Métis family”.,While the organization’s general desire to have Métis children raised in Métis homes is somewhat understandable in light of colonialism, the child should be allowed to stay with its current guardians because his best interests are more important than any general cultural concerns.,It was once official government policy to eliminate the culture of First Nations peoples. A related phenomenon was the “60s scoop”, a practice that occurred in Canada, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s, where predominately white families adopted First Nations children. Many of the adopted children maladjusted to their circumstances and turned to substance abuse.,In light of this history, it makes sense the Métis people would attempt to ensure their cultural survival and be concerned about the threat they perceive to the child in question.,However, in 2013, it would be wrong to make the little boy a symbol of cultural survival. That burden is a lot to bear for a child who simply needs stable and loving parents.,There isn’t any indication that the child’s current guardians are poor parents. The immediate alternative would be a transition back into family services, which would presumably be traumatic for both parents and child. Ideally, it would be the child’s choice as to where he ends up, but he’s probably still too young to make that judgement.,Whether or not this little boy will eventually become alienated from his childhood cultural experiences is impossible to know. As of now, those making decisions for him should leave overarching historical, cultural and political debates to the side, weigh the odds, and allow him to stay with the couple who has already cared for him for over two years."},{"title":"Toss the costs","url":"/story/2013-10-10/editorials/toss-costs/","date":"October 10, 2013","content":"The first Homecoming weekend has brought on yet another debate about policing costs and student behaviour. While the weekend’s celebrations triggered many students to gather on Aberdeen St., and Queen’s has contributed to policing costs in the past, renewing such an agreement would be unjust.,It doesn’t make sense to punish Queen’s students as a whole for the actions of a small handful. Additionally, Queen’s students already contribute a fair amount of economic benefits to the City of Kingston.,Although the Aberdeen street party was much smaller this year than in previous years, it got big enough to warrant extra policing. However, it’s important to note the composition of the crowd that called for this extra attention from police: Approximately two-thirds of those ticketed or arrested were not Queen’s students.,There’s no good argument that differentiates Queen’s students that did participate from other Kingston residents. They were off campus, and they weren't at a University-sanctioned event. Queen’s as an institution did its due diligence to prevent a recurrence of Homecoming’s worst problems.,The fact that a tiny percentage of Queen’s students participated in the Aberdeen street party shouldn't come with consequences for the entire student body: financing a fee for policing expenses. Queen’s students who misbehave already pay the exorbitant fines doled out during events like Homecoming. All other students pay property taxes through their rent, and make large contributions to the local economy in a plethora of other direct and indirect ways.,Mayor Mark Gerretsen is the main voice calling on Queen’s to compensate the City. This is unfortunate for the proponents of such a plan, as Gerretsen has lost credibility in the aftermath of the exaggerated\nand divisive rhetoric he voiced over Homecoming weekend.,Gerretsen’s ongoing campaign to have students eliminated from census data for future municipal elections, thus reduce student representation on council, makes his attempt to shake Queen’s down for policing costs an even greater farce. Gerretsen is trying to get students to pay more for policing while simultaneously working to eliminate their say in local politics.,It’s too bad that some students see Homecoming solely as an opportunity for a street party. This tendency develops into a mob mentality, which effectively eliminates closing Aberdeen St. as an effectual resolution to Homecoming’s problems. That said, forcing Queen’s to pay for policing costs is a non-starter. What we need now is leadership and a renewed attempt to find alternative solutions."},{"title":"Rolling Stone relays radicalization","url":"/story/2013-07-30/editorials/rolling-stone-relays-radicalization/","date":"July 30, 2013","content":"This April, the city of Boston was the target of day-long series of terrorist attacks that left five people dead and hundreds injured. In a move that was bound to spark controversy, Rolling Stone magazine put one of the alleged perpetrators of the attacks — Dzhokhar Tsarnaev — on the front cover of a recent issue.,Ultimately, Rolling Stone was right to publish this cover as the image the magazine chose gets to the heart of the issue at hand — a seemingly normal young American who ended up carrying out horrible acts of violence.,In the direct aftermath of any tragedy, our thoughts should be with the victims and their families, and anything less would not be properly empathetic.,However, this reaction should not come with a simultaneous demonization of the alleged perpetrators.,Doing so dehumanizes them and clouds our judgment when we eventually come around to dealing with the underlying problems that may have encouraged their actions. Moreover, in our society, guilt is not assumed but has to be established in a court of law.,Rolling Stone has a long history of political journalism and social commentary. Political figures and individuals noted for their criminality have been on its cover before, so this particular cover shouldn’t be too shocking.,The crux of Rolling Stone’s story on Dzhokhar was that he was a normal young adult who was slowly radicalized into someone willing to carry out acts of terrorism. The picture chosen for the cover is the perfect symbol of this reality. Perhaps this is partly what draws the ire of the cover’s detractors. Dzhokhar does not fit the terrorist stereotype — instead, he looks like the boy next door.,Victims and perpetrators should both be remembered as their experiences are important and informative. It is disquieting to think about victims and their families having to see the face of the person who allegedly caused their misfortune. That said, this cover has put an uncomfortable truth front and centre and will hopefully provoke a valuable debate about the root causes of violence.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Possible abuse with taser use","url":"/story/2013-09-20/editorials/possible-abuse-taser-use/","date":"September 20, 2013","content":"Peel Regional Police recently tasered an 80-year-old woman named lole Pasquale, who has dementia and wandered away from her Mississauga home late at night. While she was allegedly carrying a knife which she “wouldn’t relinquish,” this event should make all Ontarians wary of the fact that more front-line police officers will be carrying tasers in this province.,There are virtually no excuses for tasering an 80-year-old woman. The officer in question probably should have exercised greater restraint. Anyone with an elderly grandparent or a general respect for seniors would agree that such an action should be a complete last resort.,That said, police are put into very tough situations and being hyper-critical of police tactics without the benefit of full context isn’t good form. Officers have to make judgements very quickly in pressure-filled circumstances. Nevertheless, this case is a good starting point for a discussion about taser use in light of changes in police policy.,In the aftermath of the Sammy Yatim case, in which a young man on a streetcar was shot nine times by Toronto Police, the Ontario Community Safety Minister announced new rules which will allow regular police officers to carry tasers. Previously, only “supervising and tactical officers” were given permission.,If tasers are going to be issued to more police, there should be a re-evaluation and tightening of the rules surrounding their use. Because tasers are perceived as non-lethal, the risk is that Ontario police officers will use them more than they would use guns. A significant increase in taser use would be completely unacceptable and would likely lead to more incidents like the one that occurred in Mississauga.,These events also raise questions about police recruitment practices. If regular officers are going to have more responsibilities, shouldn’t there be higher standards when hiring them?,If more police officers are going to carry tasers, their use should be strictly monitored. Tasers can be deadly weapons and should be used at a last resort, much like firearms.,This article has been updated to reflect the following correction: The woman who was tasered is named lole Pasquale, not Angela.,The Journal regrets the error."},{"title":"Facebook flounders flunkies","url":"/story/2013-07-30/editorials/facebook-flounders-flunkies/","date":"July 30, 2013","content":"When Dalhousie University recently asked their failing engineering students why they were having so much trouble, many of them pointed to social media, and Facebook in particular, as the culprit for their poor academic performance.,Put simply, these students need to grow up. While social media is a new and unique distraction, it’s not an insurmountable one. Facebook is a convenient scapegoat for the human inclination towards laziness and procrastination.,Social media is hard to escape if you’re a young person who hopes to maintain a robust social life. Instead of calling or texting a new friend or acquaintance, the expectation is that you’ll add each other on Facebook and take things from there. Facebook is also a great tool for common interest groups and extracurricular clubs.,Young people’s interaction with these new platforms sometimes manifests in behaviours that resemble addiction. Some will spend hours on Facebook browsing profiles or anticipating “likes” or notifications. Facebook and Twitter follow users everywhere as these sites have applications that are easily downloaded onto smartphones. However, while social media is omnipresent, it shouldn’t be held up as an insurmountable barrier to achievement.,There have always been distractions. Young people, especially those who have made the decision to go to university or college, are capable adults who have strategies at their disposal to minimize the time they spend on social media. Programs and applications can be downloaded that monitor or limit your time on Facebook. In addition, email notifications can be minimized and social media apps can be deleted off of smartphones.,Those students who cite social media as a catchall for their academic failure may not have been prepared for post-secondary education in the first place.

Canadian interns should consider following the example set by groups of unpaid interns in the United States who have recently filed lawsuits against their employers.,Those who take unpaid internships forgo income for extended periods of time. As such, being an unpaid intern is not a practical choice for those from low-income families. This is a critical problem with the status quo; it exacerbates inequality in the job market.,Internships are an essential experience when starting a career in fields such as politics, fashion or journalism. People from low-income families are already severely underrepresented in these fields. More than just a question of inequality, unpaid internships are a question of perspective. News organizations in particular need employees from a variety of backgrounds.,Making sure that companies pay their interns minimum wage would undoubtedly mean fewer internship opportunities. Still, society has a duty to protect young workers from exploitation. A single reference on a resume is not sufficient compensation for a young person who has given up months or years of their time. That said, strict enforcement could be costly and ineffective and would require new legislation. Luckily, alternative measures are available.,Governments could subsidize companies that pay their interns and educational institutions could compensate students for the time they spend as interns. These initiatives would ensure that interns are properly compensated without reducing the amount of opportunities.,No matter the chosen remedy, young people must take the lead on this issue. They’re the ones directly affected as they’re the individuals that compete for internships. Young people should do their best to “level the playing field” at the critical transition point between education and work, as many of their peers face financial constraints.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Student athletes deserve more","url":"/story/2013-09-13/editorials/student-athletes-deserve-more/","date":"September 13, 2013","content":"A former Bishop’s University football player has sued the school after they refused to pay his medical bills following a concussion sustained during a football game two years ago. The 23-year-old’s entire right side was paralyzed as a result of the incident and he’s only just recently regained the ability to walk. During the game in question, the player was allegedly sent back out onto the field after complaining of concussion-like symptoms.,No student should ever pay the high price that this player has. In addition to demanding extra vigilance from coaches, universities could do more to compensate athletes for their injuries.,While athletes do have personal discretion, coaches have the final say when it comes to whether an athlete is fit to continue playing. Student athletes, particularly football players, face incredible social pressure from teammates and the wider campus culture to perform well and be tough for the sake of winning games. As such, they have a huge conflict of interest when it comes to deciding if they’re able to play with an injury. Coaches should use the training they have and take the utmost precaution when it comes to brain injuries like the one in question here.,The university’s assertion that they can’t identify a significant hit which caused the young man’s injury is suspicious. The nature of concussions is that many small impacts can add up and create a larger issue. In general, brain injuries can’t always be tracked back to a specific incident.,It’s good to see that there is a burgeoning debate about paying student athletes in the United States. While you often hear the claim that Canadian athletes don’t make their schools any money, it’s hard to calculate the value of a program like Queen’s football in terms of Queen’s reputation as a university. Greater compensation for Canadian student athletes should certainly be considered.,While the current discourse about student mental health is very positive, we can’t forget about student physical health.

Amongst other things, they were expected to ensure creative and intellectual vitality in human society. Now, universities are increasingly businesslike and expected to efficiently serve the economy. This transition, currently in its later stages, is regrettable for\nmany reasons.,Universities used to ensure that individual students were exposed to a variety of subjects. Today, the aggressive separation of subject matter into different “silos” is one of the most pernicious problems with education.,University students often find themselves stuck in a certain major, unable to branch out into related fields. Conversely, students who desire to study a specific topic within their field can’t find\nenough courses to do so. Either way, filling out prerequisites and required credits to form a seemingly random catalogue of completed courses becomes the default strategy.,Perversely, the strict separation of subjects makes it easier to cut individual faculties as student solidarity is reduced through isolation. Students don’t see the value of the programs\non the chopping block because they were largely prevented from engaging with them.,Universities shouldn’t stagnate; they should experiment with things like online courses. Programs with little or no demand should be put up for elimination or integrated into other programs or faculties.,However, these decisions should be made with increased student and faculty consultation. That was one of the major problems with what happened at the University of Alberta — the decision to suspend the programs was made unilaterally.,It’s not clear how much money the University of Alberta will save by eliminating or restructuring the programs it has suspended.

Smith’s editorial portrayed some of our orientation events unfairly as many of them have significantly changed since his graduation.,Last Friday, Queen’s TV released a video rebuttal to Smith’s anti-Frosh Week sentiment, featuring students reciting a scripted response. The clip is addressed to Smith, and rightly points out his factual inaccuracies and unfair assumptions.,What made me cringe, though, was the way that Smith’s personal experience was dismissed in a condescending way.,“We’re sorry you had an unfortunate Frosh Week,” a group of students say in the clip. The last speaker in the video points out that Frosh Week is optional, “so there’s that.”,Is this really the message we want to send to people who didn’t enjoy their Frosh Week? What if there are people on campus right now who don’t feel at home and silently agree with Smith?,If it were me, I’d feel uncomfortable and even more alienated after watching the video.,It concerns me that the spirit of the video reflects an unfortunate truth: that the mass of our student body finds it nearly impossible to accept criticism of our university’s traditions and practices.,The article should have started a discussion about inclusivity, alternative frosh events and resources for those who are having a hard time calling Queen’s their home.,Smith deserves to be corrected for his errors and misconceptions, but we should also think seriously about his experience.,We need to start listening to others – even if what they say isn’t what we want to hear."},{"title":"Issue 5: Darts & Laurels","url":"/story/2013-09-10/editorials/issue-5-darts-laurels/","date":"September 10, 2013","content":"Each digital release of the Journal will feature weekly darts and laurels, listing what should be celebrated and criticized from the previous week in news and campus culture.,Darts:,Graduate students displaced to Confederation Place Hotel,Some graduate students are being housed in a hotel that is a 25-minute walk from campus for the second year in a row. It’s unfortunate that these students are excluded from the excitement of being near campus. While Queen’s only has a short term arrangement with the hotel, it’s likely that this state of affairs could go on indefinitely as Queen’s enrolment increases and residence rooms get even more scarce. While the students currently being housed in the hotel agreed to be there, and many of them are satisfied with their arrangements, university administration should not get complacent with this solution.,Misogynistic chant at the University of British Columbia and St. Mary’s University,The chant that was used during frosh week at these universities is completely unacceptable. The content of the chant is blatantly offensive and students who claim otherwise insult the intelligence of everyone involved. The fact that UBC students were told not to yell the chant in public is beside the point – the idea that someone uncomfortable with the chant would be made to yell it is especially troubling. It’s good to see that some student leaders have apologized and stepped down over the controversy.,The Underground’s opening,The rebranded Alfie’s nightclub had a solid opening night and the current student leadership should be given credit for beginning the year with an exciting event. However, the rebranding from Alfie’s to The Underground seems superficial as the decor had already recently been changed. Moreover, student government had an opportunity to consult with students when choosing the new name and decor for the nightspot. Doing so might have fostered a renewed student connection with the space and would have served as a good marketing opportunity. The Underground will probably continue to face the same fiscal challenges until a visionary student leadership actively learns from the mistakes of previous changes.,PM Stephen Harper’s handling of the Keystone XL pipeline,Facing the possibility that the Keystone XL pipeline to the United States could be rejected due to environmental opposition, Harper told Barack Obama that he would agree to new emissions regulations on the oil and gas industry. Needless to say, it should not have taken Harper this long to look out for Canada’s interests. Questions also remain as to why Harper is advocating so aggressively for a private pipeline.,Laurels:,Queen’s football,Queen’s football team beat McMaster 31-24 on Sept. 2. The Gaels now sit pretty at 3-0. Monday’s victory was particularly sweet as Queen’s had not beat McMaster in five games, including two tough playoff losses. An early record of 3-0 in an eight-game season virtually guarantees the Gaels a top spot in the OUA. The Queen's Gaels are no longer “rebuilding”, they’re the real deal. This year, Queen’s might get its first real taste of playoff football since the magical 2009 season. This success is coming at an opportune time; it could attract necessary attention to the poor state of our football facilities.,New bike lanes on Princess St.,It’s great that the City of Kingston is encouraging bicycling. Cyclists will now feel safer and more welcome in the limestone city. The many students who ride their bikes downtown to do shopping or errands will undoubtedly have an easier time. Bike lanes are not without their fair share of problems; many accidents are caused by cyclists swerving to avoid the terrible conditions on the side of the road. It’s a good thing that the relevant road sections are being repaved.,New Frosh Week mental health initiative,It’s great to see the new mental health initiative taking place during Frosh Week. The evidence-based approach is very impressive, and the fact that it will be developed over five years gives it a sense of continuity in what can sometimes be a fleeting and repetitive campus environment. If Queen’s is going to take the mental health of its students seriously, then engaging with them early on is critical.,Greater regulations for oral contraceptives,Both the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and the College of Family Physicians of Canada are requesting that the federal government put greater regulation in place so that Canadians do not receive faulty oral contraceptives.

It’s about confidence, but more than that, it’s about comparing ourselves to a feminine “other”.,If I were to tell a woman that she is less “womanly” because she doesn’t wear makeup, that would be offensive, yet it would be perfectly acceptable to say a man is less manly wearing it.,It’s the same type of repression, yet it’s rarely discussed among us men. As women reject traditional gender roles, we desperately cling to them.,It’s almost a taboo subject, which I believe stems from the insecurity and constant comparison the idea of “manliness” encourages. Questioning your own masculinity is not an easy task.,The modern woman can now, theoretically, fill the roles of both the “masculine” and the “feminine”. She’s encouraged to raise a family and pursue her career dreams. Why don’t we ask the same of men?,We talk as if working mothers are the only people balancing career and family. Where is the father? Why isn’t he responsible for caring for the children when his wife doesn’t have the time?,Why is it less manly to care for your children than to log hours at work?,We need this discussion. Women can’t discuss it for us any more than we can discuss what it means to be a woman.,Push through the insecurity. Ask questions. Don’t take “boys will be boys” or “that’s how it is” as an answer. It’s simply not good enough anymore."},{"title":"Unextraordinary league, indeed","url":"/story/2013-09-20/editorials/unextraordinary-league-indeed/","date":"September 20, 2013","content":"A female Queen’s student was recently rejected from joining the League of Unextraordinary Gentlemen (LUG), a Kingston hockey league run by former Queen’s students, but not associated with the University.,The League’s managers have handled the situation very poorly. Whether or not this has been a gross violation of individual rights is unclear, but the League’s justifications for excluding her raise serious questions.,The player in question is said to be pretty good at hockey. She’s been playing with a group of male friends in Queen’s intramurals and hoped to join them in the LUG. The general manager of the League acknowledged that he had seen her play and that her skill level was not the issue.,The main reason the League cites for excluding women is “health and safety”. At first blush, this seems reasonable as men generally grow to become larger and stronger than women.,However, these grounds for exclusion become weaker in light of the fact that the League apparently occupies a grey area between full-contact and non-contact hockey.,It should be noted that women have participated in full-contact hockey as high up as the professional level.,In addition to “health and safety” reasons, the player was excluded based on a “business maneuver” because “as soon as men buy into the league … they expect to play in an only-men’s league.” The league manager clearly implied,that those who sign up for the LUG expect the absence of female players. Would this type of thinking be tolerated if applied to any other group?,It’s not clear whether or not the League will allow women to play with men in the future, if they will create a separate league for women or if they will continue to completely exclude women.,The League has been active since 2009 and has not yet developed any rules or policy on the matter. Needless to say, the men who are running this league should have prepared for the eventuality that a woman would ask to sign up. Establishing whether or not they consider their league to be strictly men-only would be a good start.,No matter what choice the LUG eventually makes, as of now, a skilled player is being excluded from competing for no good reason."},{"title":"Popular pollution","url":"/story/2013-09-20/editorials/popular-pollution/","date":"September 20, 2013","content":"Music is very important to me. That’s why when I see mainstream performers like Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber shocking an audience to create viral attention, I feel it cheapens the experience.,I’m not naive to the reality that many people in the music-making business are in it to make money. However, it’s lamentable when the antics of a musician overshadow the music they produce.,The music industry is an ever-evolving machine that has become more and more efficient at gleaning money from the public. The production of music videos for channels such as MTV, which gained real momentum in the 80s, changed musicians from a voice emanating from speakers into a personality to watch. Today, we don’t only want to listen to their music, but we want to know what clothes they wear, who they listen to and what they believe in.,These changes have been magnified with the advent of the internet. With a simple search, you can learn everything you might want to know about a singer’s personal life.,This progression is not necessarily a negative thing. Often, videos or a musician’s persona can deepen the meaning you get from a song. However, we’ve now entered unprecedented territory.,So much of today’s music is overshadowed by the accompanying provocative music videos, the extreme personas the musicians adopt and the ins and outs of their personal lives. The bombardment never stops, especially on the internet.,It’s become hard to critique an artist’s music in isolation. When asked if I like someone’s music, I find myself judging him or her on the way they conduct themselves in the public eye.,Today’s mainstream music is insincere. It’s no longer an outlet for emotion and art, but simply another conduit though which we are spoon-fed what the marketers want us to know and consume.,We need to reclaim our minds.

A part of Kingston’s “Canada’s Most Sustainable City” initiative, the group has failed to reach quorum at its last four meetings. A motion that the body passed, which requested that future City reports contain sections on “environmental considerations”, has essentially been ignored. The fact that environmental issues have fallen by the wayside in Kingston is symptomatic of a larger problem. Many are quick to use sustainability and environmentalism as political or civic calling cards without actually factoring them into their plans. Politicians and City staff need to be held accountable on this front as issues like climate change are not going away.,Putin’s anti-gay Olympics,Russia’s anti-gay laws are an affront to basic morality and human decency. The fact that gay activists and regular people are oppressed for displaying their love is more than unsettling. At this point, however, boycotting the Sochi Olympics in response to these events isn’t a realistic option. Apart from logistical barriers and punishing Canadian athletes, a boycott would be hypocritical and short-sighted. The West has largely ignored Russia’s longstanding mistreatment of sexual minorities. Taking a stand now on this issue would be fairly arbitrary. Why was there no boycott of the Beijing Olympics due to horrible human rights abuses taking place in China?,AMS promises unfulfilled,The current AMS executive deserves credit for introducing some positive new initiatives and services like The Brew. However, the executive’s failure to come through on some projects promised during last year’s election is disheartening. The team promised new blue lights in City and Victoria Parks, WiFi in residential areas around campus and monthly LGBTQ nights at Alfie’s (since renamed The Underground). Initiatives like new blue lights and more WiFi coverage are huge undertakings that have come up against real but predictable barriers. Why make “ambitious” promises if they have no hope of coming to fruition? Like many politicians, this executive has fallen into the pattern of making promises it can’t keep.,Laurels:,The Whig-Standard’s seven-part series on Line 9,The Whig Standard's investigative coverage last week on the Line 9 pipeline is deserving of great praise. As a small paper with limited resources, it would be easy to churn out piecemeal day-to-day journalism, but the Whig took on an expansive project. If mainstream media organizations are going to survive, it will be because this type of investigative digging and in-depth coverage keeps readers willing to pay. In a scattered and confused media climate, these efforts are critical. The Toronto Star’s recent focus on investigations is another great example.,Opposition to the Parti Québécois’ (PQ) racist proposal,It’s great to see all the opposition to the recently announced Quebec values charter. In addition to street protests in Montreal, an Ontario hospital released an advertisement appealing to Quebec medical students with the tagline “We don’t care what’s on your head; we care what’s in it”. Almost all political commentators and politicians outside of Quebec have come out against the proposal. This measured response, which comes from regular people, politicians, political commentators and institutions, stands in contrast to the racist politics of the PQ. Pauline Marois has manufactured a controversy to win votes among her largely white and rural base. It’s a shame that more important economic and social issues have fallen to the wayside because everyone’s attention is on this ridiculous proposal.,The Brew opens,The Brew is a promising addition to campus. Students now have a fresh alternative to the long lines in the Queen's Centre. The fact that The Brew is occupying space in what was formerly a very dead zone of the JDUC is a large part of its appeal. The soups and sandwiches, the seating and the neat details like the sign, which was created by fine arts students, all make for a cozy vibe. All in all, the location was branded very well. What was once an isolated part of the JDUC is now a decent hangout spot.,Queen’s workers unite,Queens’s post-doctoral fellows are voting to potentially authorize a strike for better wages and benefits. Post-doctoral fellows are PhDs who have been hired by the University to do research. While they are full-time employees, they have to pay out-of-pocket to get access to benefits. As if this weren’t bad enough, some fellows are paid as little as $28,000 a year as there is no base salary for their work and little hope of salary increases. The fact that these workers are so undercompensated is a symptom of an anti-intellectual culture that doesn’t recognize the contributions of its brightest. Some Queen’s post-docs are even doing cancer research. It’s good they are putting themselves in a more aggressive bargaining position because they deserve more.,― Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Issue 9: Darts & Laurels","url":"/story/2013-09-24/editorials/issue-9-darts-laurels/","date":"September 24, 2013","content":"Each digital release of the Journal will feature weekly darts and laurels, listing what should be celebrated and criticized from the previous week in world news and campus culture.,Darts:,Racist Miss America reactions,The most recent winner of the Miss America beauty pageant is an Indian-American woman from Syracuse, NY. After she was crowned, some degenerate people authored racist tweets insisting that Miss America could not come from such a background. The messages ranged from subtly hostile to overtly racist and Islamophobic. The strong backlash that ensued against these tweets, which came from both mainstream and digital media, was heartening. While social media can make controversies immediate, and can sometimes exaggerate them, websites like Twitter make the worst thoughts in human culture completely public. The public nature of social media also means, though, that terrible opinions are open to criticism and authors are publicly shamed.,K-ROCK’s “fellating” contest,Kingston’s K-ROCK radio station recently hosted a contest calling for participants to “snap a pic of you felating (sic) an inanimate object to our facebook page and you could win tickets to see Matt Good or Crash Karma in Kingston!”. After the station received complaints, they claimed that the competition was inspired by a recent Miley Cyrus music video where she is seen licking a sledgehammer. Put simply, this contest is stupid and immature. How much respect can this station have for its listeners if they are soliciting pictures of them performing oral sex on inanimate objects?,Racist chant at the University of British Columbia,The University of British Columbia (UBC) is mired in yet another controversy. In the aftermath of the misogynistic chant episode, allegations of racist chanting have come to light. A student claims to have overheard a frosh group chanting “White man steal our land”. The alleged chanters were part of a “Pocahontas” frosh group in-line with the week’s “Disney” theme. It’s particularly unfortunate that colonialism is being trivialized on territory that has been contested by local First Nations. This racist slogan, spoken in broken English, reinforces a false caricature of ignorant and powerless First Nations people. While it’s alleged that no student leader encouraged the chant, the entire frosh group was said to be chanting it within view and earshot of many passersby. If these allegations prove true, and no student leader reported this behaviour, then UBC should redouble its efforts to create a more inclusive campus environment.,Huronia survivors get a settlement,The Ontario government recently settled with the former residents of a home for “developmentally challenged” children. These children were physically and psychologically abused and, in some cases, raped and molested at Huronia Regional Treatment Centre near Orillia. It’s a shame that it took the government this long to compensate Huronia’s former residents. Some survivors undoubtedly attempted to navigate many layers of bureaucracy just to get their stories recognized before this recent victory. The maximum individual payout of $42,000 is a pittance for older survivors who have had to deal with decades of suffering before and after their institutionalization.,Laurels:,Redskins renamed,The Nepean Redskins, a youth football club near Ottawa, recently agreed to change its name. Pressure was mounting on the club after a local First Nations man lodged a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission regarding the name. The club made the right choice, as the name was odious, and they were also able to avoid a drawn-out legal battle. While completely unacceptable for a youth team, the name change obviously raises questions about pro-sports teams with similar names and imagery. The Washington Redskins, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians and Chicago Blackhawks should take note.,Pope changes tone on social issues,Pope Francis’ recent comment about sexual morality and abortion are a welcome change from the leader of an organization that has, and continues to, oppress women and sexual minorities throughout the world. In an interview recently released, the Pope acknowledged that the Catholic Church has focused far too much on issues like: “abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods”. Queen’s is a relatively non-religious environment, but it’s important to remember that there are parts of the world where the Catholic Church has significant sway. Those who turn on the Pope’s every word may now adjust their priorities in a positive direction. Gay rights and abortion are matters of human rights and personal autonomy, so it’s great to see powerful institutions like the American government and the Catholic Church bending towards the current moral climate.,Student-run anti-sexual assault initiative,Victims of sexual assault are breaking their silence with a new student-run project at Queen’s. Volunteers for the project will be photographed holding up a sign with a quote said by an abuser, or someone dismissive of sexual assault. The public nature of this project will go a long way in reducing stigma. Those who are choosing to show their faces are putting a human face to a problem that some have trouble relating to. People reading the signs and looking at the pictures will gain a greater understanding of the trauma victims have suffered, and some survivors of sexual assault who see the photos may feel empowered.,- Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Apathy or action","url":"/story/2013-09-13/editorials/apathy-or-action/","date":"September 13, 2013","content":"Whether we know it or not, it’s an issue myself and thousands of students are facing as we embark on another year at Queen’s.

Twenty years from now, will I look back on my undergrad with satisfaction, or wish that I did something more — or less?,It’s a futile query, but questioning my involvement has triggered an important realization. Reflecting on your time at school isn’t solely an exercise of recent graduates, but can — and should — be done throughout your undergraduate years.,Making the most of university isn’t as simple as acting on impulse, or as complex as basing decisions on perceived future benefit. It’s a delicate balancing act, combining our future aspirations with what makes up happy now.,My time at Queen’s and the Journal may or may not be relevant to my future career — but getting involved in the school community and developing friendships with various wonderful groups of people will certainly matter later on. Right now, I can’t think of any better alternative.,It’s the latter point that’s especially important, since no worthwhile endeavour can be done without the right company. University offers us a unique opportunity to meet people with wildly disparate backgrounds and stories — a chance that we’ll likely never encounter again.,Capitalizing on this chance helps override life’s uncertainty. By acknowledging that our stay at school is limited, we’re spurred to pursue the activities and opportunities we value most, before they wither into memories.,Without the power of foresight, all we can do is control the present — and take steps to ensure that we treasure it down the road."},{"title":"American snoops","url":"/story/2013-09-05/editorials/american-snoops/","date":"September 5, 2013","content":"Those who know me would say I’m proud to be an American.

Recently, I’ve been getting more and more questions about the National Security Agency (NSA)’s spy programs that were revealed by a former government computer specialist named Edward Snowden.,The overwhelming majority of Canadians who ask me about these programs see them as justifiable; lost privacy is okay if lives are saved by the intelligence gained\nthrough snooping.,However, this viewpoint is unsettling — Snowden’s leaks should discomfort anyone who cares about privacy and limiting state power.,Normally, Congress acts as a check on the NSA and the entirety of the executive branch. However, some Congress members have said they didn’t have full knowledge of what was being authorized in laws that extended the NSA’s power. Moreover, the special court that oversees the NSA almost always allows the agency to do what it wants.,Young people should be especially troubled by these developments as we spend lots of time using digital means of communication. Are you comfortable with your online activities being monitored and possibly recorded for use at a later time?,Every form of government either directly or indirectly derives its power from the people it governs. Americans get this. Canadians get this.

The sad reality is that there’s almost nothing preventing the NSA from spying on non-US citizens.,No matter where they snoop, the principle is the same.

Undoubtedly, my Queen’s experience has been lacking. Fourth-year classes that were once smaller than 20 people have now reached numbers beyond that. I still learned, but having individual time with a professor required more effort, a discouraging situation for a first-year student.,In lower years particularly, professors can’t focus on individual students as much anymore. The only concern is with education en masse.,How can you develop a discussion in a room full of nearly a hundred of your peers? This is a difficult way to encourage a strong education.,I’m more on the cynical side of the spectrum, but it’s important for students to have a critical impulse, especially when it comes to education itself.,You don’t need to be involved in student government or the campus newspaper to have something to say about what’s going on — everyone’s voice matters.,Post-secondary education is at a turning point.

The Charter would forbid public employees from wearing religious symbols at work and is therefore an absurd proposal which threatens to completely alienate religious minorities.,Wearing a cross or a turban does not make you bad at your job. One great critique of the proposed law has come from a Montreal doctor, a Sikh man who wears a turban. He says that if the PQ passes and enforces the Charter, he will be forced to leave Quebec or at least stop practicing medicine along with all the young residents in Montreal hospitals who wear religious attire. Montrealers might end up with longer wait times in hospitals because some people choose to cover their hair.,Quebec’s strong secular tendency has its history in the Quiet Revolution. In response to the oppressive rule of the Catholic Church, Québécois rejected conservative social norms and transferred control of their societal institutions from the Church to the government.,However, these comprehensive and democratic changes stand in contrast to the current proposal. For one thing, religious groups were not even consulted before the PQ had formed specific policy proposals.,Worse still, the proposed Charter of Quebec Values is racist and hypocritical. The PQ tolerates the crucifixes that hang in Quebec’s public spaces, including the National Assembly. The PQ would have us believe that a properly non-religious society is one in which laws can be passed under a cross but a man wearing a kippah cannot be a public employee.,In sum, adopting the Charter of Quebec Values would be short-sighted, anti-democratic, racist and hypocritical."},{"title":"Identity limited","url":"/story/2013-07-30/editorials/identity-limited/","date":"July 30, 2013","content":"Sexuality doesn’t define a person.,When I came out to my best friend in first year, I was worried about how she’d take it.

He’s gay.”,I didn’t even realize at that point how little my friends knew about me.,Today, our culture is more inclusive of sexual diversity than ever, but are we allowing our sexual identities to take over who we are?,Earlier this month, VICE Magazine ran an article that posed the question: is Canada being run by a gay mafia?,The article tried to support the claim by weeding out the “gay shenanigans of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, which seems about as straight as an episode of Glee.” The author speculated about the sexuality of notable people in federal politics, even accusing Harper’s wife, Laureen, of being a lesbian based on her alleged nickname in Ottawa: the L-word.,The author, a gay man, isn’t just guilty of incredibly shoddy journalism. He’s actively perpetuating the stereotypes that most gay communities support: a one-dimensional framework of personhood based on what makes you sexually aroused.,A few gay friends that I know, as well as myself, have at one point completely disregarded themselves or their principles in order to conform to social expectations based on their sexual orientation — common stereotypes that most agree are unfounded.,But the idea of a “gay community” itself perpetuates the notion that we’re nothing more than our sexual orientations. The concept is purely sexual and, subsequently, one-dimensional.,I am not saying that LGBTQ communities are negative spaces in the least. In July, I attended Toronto Pride for my first time and I’ve never felt more accepted.,However, communities can’t be truly inclusive if they strip individuals of qualities aside from their sexual orientation, placing them in categories that range from “L”, “G”, “B”, “T” to “Q.”,Sexual identity is only one small facet of being a human.

My generation has trouble even saying these words aloud.,Recently, I was on an American Airlines flight watching an episode of Parks and Recreation and the aforementioned words were censored.,Censorship is a way of protecting the public from words and images that can cause harm. However, words like \"vagina\" and \"breasts\" represent body parts — they aren’t verbal weapons, inappropriate\nor vulgar.,The same week as my flight, a photo of a breastfeeding toddler and his mother was removed from Facebook for violating the website’s policies. The group where the photo was posted — Breastfeeding Mama Talk — was subsequently banned for 24 hours.,When an influential social platform like Facebook allows for groups and photos that encourage the objectification of women’s bodies and discourage a positive and educational understanding of them, there is no question that perceptions of women and sexuality will be affected.,An open letter to Facebook, published by holistic parenting website MotherWise on March 11, questioned the double standard. The letter pointed out that Facebook removes pictures of breastfeeding mothers and educational diagrams of the vagina but allows groups like “Let’s Expose These Hoes” and “Big Boobs and Sex” to remain.,A clear message is being sent here, that it’s unacceptable to look upon women’s bodies in terms of female empowerment and education. If a photo or its context doesn’t tend to male sexual desire or fantasy, it’s inappropriate.,This concept is nothing new, but in an age coloured by feminism and sexual freedom, this ideology is obviously backwards.,Our censorship of body parts has created a damaging over-sexualization of the female body.

The fact that a group of people thought it would be acceptable to display the sign proves we have a long way to go as a university when it comes to gender and sex.,Saying that the sign was “just a joke” is short-sighted, and pointing out that the sign didn’t specify the gender of the subject is disingenuous.,Context is critical here; there is a long history of misogynistic Frosh Week signs at Queen’s, many of them targeting “daughters”. Regardless, the fact that the sign was addressed to “dads” is patriarchal. At worst, it implies that fathers own their daughters.,Some critiques of the sign have been extreme. Unlike previous signs, this one did not advocate rape. The one individual who lives at the house in question who commented publicly about the issue should be taken at his word when he says this was not the intention. Nevertheless, he and the others who condoned the sign are responsible for its predictable negative effects.,In this case, it’s important to consider the power dynamics of Frosh Week. First-years and their parents are coming to a new city on what can be a stressful day. Many frosh are friendless and feel completely vulnerable. In such a context, the sign could be interpreted as fairly predatory. Nobody’s initial impression of Queen’s or its surrounding areas should be a sexist catchphrase imposed on them in giant block letters.,Queen’s administration and student leaders should be given credit for disapproving of this type of blatantly misogynistic message for officially sanctioned Frosh Week events. The chants that were yelled at the University of British Columbia and St. Mary’s University last week shows there’s a greater institutional acceptance of this behaviour at these schools than we’ve seen at Queen’s.,Nevertheless, what is widely condoned in the Student Ghetto reflects back onto Queen’s culture as a whole.

Her pose shows her crotch area, which many readers found too revealing and too sexual to have on the cover of a national newspaper, especially given her age.,It’s true that with the cropping of the photo, it’s natural for the eye to be drawn to her crotch area. Exposure to that area of a body is still taboo in our society — it’s not something we discuss or display openly.,This can explain peoples’ initial discomfort with the image. But discomfort is separate from blatant disapproval.,The degree of uproar is baffling and unwarranted.,Osmond was doing nothing unusual, given her sport. Her attire, which included opaque tights and full coverage of her bottom half, was standard for figure skating. Her routine was neither provocative nor unorthodox — she was simply taking part in a regular figure skating competition.,The uproar surrounding the photo indicates an oversensitivity that’s unfortunately still inherent in our culture. It implies an underlying discomfort with the female body — we still condemn those who expose what is considered ‘too much’ skin.,If the viewer sees something sexual in the image, that’s not the Globe and Mail’s fault nor is it Osmond’s.,Most importantly, the skater herself approves of and likes the photo. While she may not be an adult, the publication of the photo shouldn’t put her in a compromising position — she was merely doing what she does every day as a figure skater.,It’s time to reevaluate what our society finds inappropriate or, more importantly, overtly sexual.

Through groups such as UEmpowered Queen’s, the focus is shifting onto empowering victims.,Fine Arts being reinstated: The reopening of BFA admissions for next year is important for the maintenance of the program at Queen’s. It’s good to see that Queen’s listened to student voices and committed to bringing the program back.,Removal of bad behavior clause: The removal of a bad behavior clause in a PSYC 300 class by the department of psychology was fair. Basing 10 per cent of a grade on behavior leaves too much room for interpretation and could discourage students from being openly critical of a class.,Men’s rugby championship: Queen’s OUA men’s rugby championship is worth celebrating. The Gaels gained redemption after an early-season loss to Western, topping the Mustangs 29-18 in the league final at Nixon Field.,New food outlets on campus: The new food outlets on campus, such as Pita Pit, Starbucks and another Tim Hortons in the JDUC, enrich student eating options on campus. The greater variety both adds to the community and creates more convenient food options for students.,Non-Academic Discipline system: The AMS’ struggle to gain greater control over the Non-Academic Discipline system at Queen’s puts power back in student hands. It’s another positive sign of AMS commitment to student autonomy.,Quidditch on campus: Seeing increased support for a non-traditional sport such as Quidditch brings a positive and fun atmosphere to the university. It was great to see schools from across the country unite at Queen’s in November for the Canadian Quidditch Cup.,Comments on the Journal website: It’s great to see that our readership is engaging critically with the material we publish through our comment boards.

He partook in the event as a delegate, not as an official representative of the DCS.,While the vote didn’t pass, the DCS executive’s decision to vote on impeachment implies grave circumstances — circumstances that weren’t there.,The use of marijuana, while illegal, is extremely common among university students. The fact that Beiswanger was smoking weed shouldn’t be a total shock, especially since it wasn’t in public nor while he was officially representing the DCS.,At Queen’s, it’s a common practice for our student leaders to drink at public functions. They receive little to no criticism for their actions. The only difference here is that Beiswanger was using an illegal substance, however socially accepted it may be.,Beiswanger should’ve been weary of his actions, especially given his position as a public representative. His position implies that he should set an example at all times, not just when he’s officially fulfilling his job.,Engaging in illegal activities, however minor, put him at risk of criticism. Being in the public eye inevitably puts your misgivings, however minor, under a harsh spotlight.,It’s not that he doesn’t deserve reprimand — however, impeachment takes this issue to a higher level than needed. The fact that Beiswanger was caught doing what countless other students do shouldn’t be shocking. An apology would’ve sufficed.,Impeachment should be saved for the grossest offences, not for a relatively minor misdemeanor.,The DCS could’ve saved Beiswanger and their organization plenty of time by calling for less harsh measures to be taken against Beiswanger.,— Journal Editorial Board,This article has been updated to reflect the following correction: Colin Beiswanger was taking part in the Jeux de Commerce as a delegate.

However, these practices deserve examination based on their merits rather than immediate dismissal.,While researching the lifestyle of “New York City's Park Avenue elite”, an author discovered that some wealthy families pay people with physical disabilities to pretend to be family members in order to skip long lines for attractions at Disney World.,This practice is unethical — it involves lying and violating regulations that have been put in place to help those who are disabled. However, a more nuanced view must be taken of the practice and its benefit to those involved. Reactionary condemnation helps no one.,Lines for people with disabilities should be for them and their actual family and friends. Anything else results in longer wait times for those rightfully trying to get the benefit they deserve.,Those legitimately skipping lines might now face suspicion from other Disney patrons, an ugly possibility.,On the other hand, the amount of people actually employing this technique is probably minimal.\nIf the practice is used by “the one per cent” as the article implies, it follows that one per cent or less of Disney World attendees employ this unethical method of line-skipping. These people are paying a premium for a service that will hopefully remain uncommon.,Yet, those with disabilities who sell their time are consenting and not exploited.,They provide a very obscure service in an arrangement which they presumably seek out themselves. Additionally, they can make more than a thousand dollars in a single day, according to the author.,We shouldn’t be paternalistic about a practice which seems mutually beneficial. After all, who doesn’t enjoy a day at Disney World?,As such, the current state of affairs is imperfect but acceptable.,It’s uncomfortable to think about people using an individual because of their disability.

His goal is to make voters fearful of the economic consequences if he’s voted out of office.,The results of British Columbia’s general election on May 14 are one example of the realities that further Harper’s strategy.,B.C. residents re-elected Christy Clark’s Liberal government, which came as a shock because the B.C. Liberals had been embarrassed by scandals and polls had them trailing the New Democrats.,According to the Globe and Mail, B.C. residents chose Clark over her opponent, Adrian Dix of the NDP, partly because the NDP was labeled “anti-development” by opponents due to its stance on energy projects like the Northern Gateway pipeline.,The results of this election highlight two important political realities that work in Stephen Harper’s favour.,First, voters often choose who to vote for based on apprehension towards the alternative rather than genuine support for a given candidate. Second, the politics of pipelines and energy are effective conduits for Canadian fears of an economic slowdown.,Harper’s team is aware of these dynamics and will continue to use them effectively.,In the lead up to Harper’s re-election in 2011, the Conservative party ran an ad that opened with scenes of rioting and ended with shots of Harper looking serene and confident. The clear implication was that he had staved off civil unrest and saved Canada from the global recession.,I don’t mean to imply that it’s only the Harper Conservatives who play off Canadian fears for electoral victory. Indeed, the Canadian left has appropriated Harper as a symbol of evil itself.,His unique style of fear-mongering, though, is perfectly formulated for Canada’s coming challenges.,The debate over natural resources exploitation is a key area in which Harper can use fear to his advantage.,The Idle No More movement was the first widespread taste of this conflict and has the potential to be significant going into the future. Harper could pivot perfectly from this development by painting his opposition as conciliatory ninnies willing to sell Canada’s economy down the river.,Reports of Harper’s demise are definitely exaggerated. Despite ongoing scandals, he’ll keep pushing his narrative of economic stability.,Harper’s politics of fear represent a conservative strategy which galvanizes his base of support, and opponents should be wary of conditions that could augment his ability to scare Canadians.,David is the Editorials Editor at the Journal."},{"title":"Leniency for limits","url":"/story/2013-03-22/editorials/leniency-limits/","date":"March 22, 2013","content":"With the latest time limits on graduate students, Queen’s is putting itself in a more precarious situation than it may realize.,The administration has placed a limit of two years on Master’s students and four years on PhD students to graduate. These new restrictions will constrict the ability of graduate students to produce high-quality work, let alone finish their degrees on time.,The problem isn’t only the shortening of degree times, it’s the extent to which the restrictions have been imposed. PhD programs take, on average, five to six years to complete, according to research collected by U15, a group of 15 research-intensive universities in Canada.,What’s most worrisome is the lack of flexibility inherent to these new limits. Some students will likely be forced to withdraw from their degree programs altogether due to their inability to complete their degree on time.,Especially when it comes to research-based graduate degrees, these time limits can be far too stringent. Sometimes studies go awry or results are inconclusive. Graduate students shouldn’t have to be punished for this — they should be supported by their university instead.,A three-year time limit for a Master’s program or five years for a PhD with the option of receiving an extension would’ve been more reasonable. Hopefully, as negotiations continue, the option of extensions will be on the table to ease some of the burden on students.,With these strict restrictions, the University is placing itself in a situation where it will be publishing more rushed and therefore lower quality research from its students. This may reduce the standing of Queen’s research in the long-run, harming its reputation.,It’s not just the University’s reputation that’s at stake here. The lack of consultation or consideration with students in this issue will hurt the administration’s relationship with students.,Graduate student representatives have clearly demonstrated they’re unhappy with the decision — the administration should take this into consideration.,One can only speculate that it comes in an effort to cut funds.,Dragging out graduate degrees can cost departments time and money, especially in giving more funding to research initiatives and in forcing professors to give more of their time to supervise students. The cuts are still far too drastic and sudden to be justifiable.

Religious texts include some of the most poignant and relatable stories ever told. It’s no surprise that Hollywood movies, in an attempt to tell stories that will strike a chord with audiences, use these themes to build their narratives.,Specifically, religious themes offer easy to digest messages, such as tales of redemption. Oftentimes, these stories include a message that audiences find uplifting and positive.,The films produced by David Cronenberg, among many others, offer messages that are far more challenging to process.,His plot lines often present characters whose actions are morally ambiguous — something that audiences may not always find appealing.,Many popular films attempt to build stories that are culturally relevant. For example, Les Misérables, one of the films nominated for an Oscar this year, was adapted from a play written in post-revolutionary France when religion played a huge role in French culture.,To tell a story that excluded religious themes would have made it irrelevant to his audience.,While today’s Western society is more secular, everyone still has an opinion on religion.

Whether it has to do with Green’s resignation or with his replacement, Eril Berkok and TK Pritchard have failed to give voters the full story they deserve.,The entire process has proven that Berkok and Pritchard don’t in fact stand for what they promised during the election. The lack of transparency and the tone taken on by the team shows that student voices aren’t truly valued. AMS Assembly has echoed this by placing their own interests above those of students.,Starting with Green’s resignation, Berkok and Pritchard demonstrated their lack of commitment to transparency. While they did release a statement on their individual Facebook accounts and vaguely explained what happened from their perspective at AMS Assembly, their side of the story still contradicts Green’s.,The day of Green’s resignation, Berkok and Pritchard repeatedly avoided requests by the Journal for an interview. They also refused to write a letter to the editor to address the issue.,While they did send in their Facebook statement, they didn’t give the Journal the chance to ask the questions necessary to understand the situation better.,They’ve also failed to provide students with three elected representatives in the AMS executive office. Starting in May, students won’t get the team they voted for.,But democracy isn’t just about elections; it’s also about how elected representatives choose to speak on behalf of their students. Plummer’s appointment was ultimately approved by members of the AMS Assembly — they should carry part of the onus for putting the interests of the AMS over the interests of students.,It’s true that the decision to use section 2.02.03 of the AMS constitution — allowing Berkok and Pritchard to nominate Plummer to replace Green — follows the procedures in place.,It’s also true that Plummer was voted in to office by elected representatives in a constitutional manner. But democracy shouldn’t just be about following rules. What elected representatives failed to do in this case was look beyond procedure and truly consider how their constituents’ voices would be best heard.,What was shown instead by voting representatives at AMS Assembly was an almost unanimous concern for AMS hiring and the damage a new election or referendum would cause to the AMS proceedings.,Students were told that a new election or any other alternative would be more detrimental to students than the outlined path.,At the end of the day, it shouldn’t be up to representatives to make that call — it should be up to their constituents.,The decision to vote with so little consideration for representing students’ voices is both patronizing and paternalistic.,In an ideal world, the fairest and quickest way to vote Plummer in would’ve been through an online referendum. A quick vote from students would have given Plummer the legitimacy to sit on AMS Assembly and serve students.,AMS Assembly didn’t have to vote yes to Plummer’s appointment, they could’ve called for an election. Furthermore, the decision to carry out the vote as a public roll call instead of as a secret ballot was unfair to voting members who may have disagreed with the status quo.,By forcing everyone to publicly voice whether they supported the motion or not, peer pressure may have played a role in the representatives’ decision more than it should have.,A closed vote would have been the fairest way to run the vote, and it’s baffling why a motion was made to make it a roll call instead.,It’s disappointing to see that many of those who spoke at the Special Assembly put their own interests ahead of those of students.Many of those who spoke in favour of this matter were personally connected to the incoming executive or had a personal stake in the matter.,While it’s true that an overwhelming majority of 37, against 3, voted in favour of Plummer taking the position, we can’t help but doubt this vote’s legitimacy due to the way the vote occurred.,As a result of the proceedings, Plummer still doesn’t have the democratic legitimacy that she would’ve had were she directly elected by the student body.,The incoming AMS executive has shown a fundamental disrespect for students’ voices. Moving forward, the very least they can do is take steps to make constitutional changes to ensure that this sort of situation doesn’t happen again.,The constitution should reinforce democracy. By engraining amendments that would allow for a quick referendum to be called in case this ever happens again, the executive can commit themselves to reinforcing democracy instead of abusing it.,Much of the damage may be irreversible at this point.,Students ultimately are not getting what they voted for.

Specifically, his comments, where he claimed that some of the onus should be placed on the victim, have sparked outrage among students.,Drawing an analogy between a rapist and a thief, he claimed that going out at night is similar to wearing expensive jewelry in a dangerous part of town. In each situation, the victim is putting themselves at greater risk of harm, Prescott outlined.,Some argue that the reaction to Prescott’s comment was blown out of proportion, claiming that it was simply mirroring a common frame of mind on the issue. But one aspect of the statement was impossible to misconstrue.,The problematic part was Prescott’s claim that the onus is on the victim for putting themselves in danger.,It’s disappointing that Prescott hasn’t publicly apologized for his statement and shown a willingness to understand the issues better. His lack of remorse isn’t constructive in moving the discussion past his statements and to the actual issues surrounding rape culture.,Although Prescott made the comment on Facebook through his private account, and didn’t comment in an official capacity, he’s nonetheless a public figure. While they are allowed to express their own opinions on social media about certain topics, it’s naïve to think that their constituents and followers aren’t seeing and critiquing them.,Especially when expressing opinions on topics as sensitive as sexual assault, Prescott should’ve been weary of his position in student government before speaking out.,It’s no surprise that ASUS Assembly has chosen to censure Prescott, actively removing their association to Prescott’s comments.,An impeachment would’ve been a far stronger and more aggressive move against what was still a personal opinion. A censure was enough of a gesture. Whether the three ASUS Assembly members’ decision to resign was warranted is more questionable.,There are now three missing representatives on ASUS assembly to represent constituents, which is worrisome. However, especially given Prescott’s lack of apology and remorse for his statement, it’s understandable why they may feel uncomfortable working with him.,While Prescott’s censure was warranted, what is problematic is the uproar and verbal attacks directed at Prescott in light of his comments by individuals who attended the ASUS special assembly.,Prescott is a divisive figure on Queen’s campus. He has often taken controversial, inflammatory and very public stances on issues important to students.,Many individuals disagree with him, but that doesn’t warrant the blatant disrespect and hatred directed at him. While he may have offended many students in making his comment, an eye for an eye isn’t the way to react.,Prescott as an individual didn’t deserve to be attacked, harassed or targeted as a result of his comments.,It was very brave of survivors of sexual assault to stand up at Assembly and tell their stories and it’s fair for individuals to voice disagreement with his statement.,But, Assembly by no means should have become a foum for the denigration of Prescott’s character. Some question whether ASUS Assembly was even an appropriate forum to discuss this.,There’s not much left to debate when it comes to Prescott himself — the special ASUS Assembly to impeach him is in the past and the debate surrounding him should end.,It’s time for Queen’s campus to move forward. Even if Prescott doesn’t reach out to make amends for his comments, he should stop being targeted and demonized by the student body.,Instead, there needs to be a discussion about the culture and discourse surrounding rape.

Posts on Facebook have decried the episode as a “chubby girl’s fantasy.” Rather than being shocked about the storyline — a 24 year-old barista lands a doctor — some seem to be fuming over the fact they find Dunham ugly.,The reaction is sad, but unsurprising given our society’s typical standards of beauty.,It’s clear that the episode was meant to be partially provocative and Dunham has been successful in initiating discussion about standards of beauty.,Clearly, society’s still not ready to push the envelope too much. Although the latest trend is a push for ‘real bodies’ to be depicted in the media, when push comes to shove, we’re unfortunately still aspiring to narrow forms of beauty.,Dunham’s body type is by no means abnormal.

It’s likely they would use the proceeds to fund their illegal and violent trade.,Nevertheless, people in positions of power need to be held accountable even if the means to acquire evidence is sometimes questionable.,Video evidence is fairly reliable, and crowdsourcing the money to pay for the video allows for regular citizens to facilitate the process if they so desire. While the media’s coverage may seem gratuitous, the alternative was staying silent about the misconduct of an elected official — a more unethical option.,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Reclaiming words","url":"/story/2013-03-08/editorials/reclaiming-words/","date":"March 8, 2013","content":"Katherine Fernandez-Blance,For,The English language is constantly evolving, and with it, so should the use of our pejoratives.,There’s been a recent effort to ‘take-back’ words that are usually deemed too offensive and derogatory to mention in civil conversation.,It’s a good start, considering that words are power. It’s about time that historically marginalized groups reclaim a space that has been taken from them.,I’ll print slut and dyke, but I won’t say the N-word. It’s a simple logic — while I might have been referred to as a slut or dyke at some point in my life, I’ve never, and likely will never be referred to as the N-word. It’s a personal choice, which is what reclamation should be about. Of course verbal harassment and labeling is never justified. But, the reclamation of words that have historically been used to marginalize can be empowering.,In my first year at Queen’s I attended the Vagina Monologues, a feminist production that many,know for the scene in which audience members are encouraged to chant “cunt” along with a cast member.,I was visibly uncomfortable with the scene, having always thought the word was one of the most foul expletives in the English language.,Yet years later, when I next saw the show, I chanted alongside the cast. I did so because I wanted to be part of an action that protested a previously anti-feminist word, and changed its meaning. The word was no longer scary, or rude; in that specific context, it was empowering.,Social movements have been successful in doing this exact thing.,It’s not wrong for SlutWalk, a nation-wide event designed to protest slut-shaming, or Dyke March, a lesbian-led event, part of Toronto’s Pride Parade, to name themselves after a pejorative. Rap music particularly has different variations of the N-word in their lyrics. If musicians wish to reclaim the word as an act of protest, they shouldn’t be condemned for doing so.,It’s up to the individual to self-identify and it’s important to contextualize a given situation.,Of course one could argue that a blanket ban on certain pejoratives would ultimately be more fruitful, but in a consistently sexist, homophobic and racist society, this is wishful thinking. We own our words; they shouldn’t hold the power over us.,Katherine is one of the Editors in Chief at the Journal.,Labiba Haque,Against,There’s a reason why words hurt.,Words are a communal tool that can be easily used as weapons due to the power they hold.,Regardless of good intentions, to try and shift that supposed power may cause more harm than good.,In recent years, events such as SlutWalk have tried to reclaim the word “slut” to challenge notions of victim-blaming and sexual violence.,Although I commend the effort, I don’t think the onus should be on rebranding people’s perception of what the word means. Words are so deeply entrenched in our society that it takes more than an attempt by a few to truly take away their power.,My opponent states that reclaiming all pejorative words is a possibility. I suppose it is for some, but only if it becomes gradually acceptable in society and their meaning is largely altered — a feat that’s rarely possible.,Many supporters of appropriation point to “queer” as an example of successful word reclamation. They suggest that this can be done for all words, if the group reclaiming it is associated with the word.,But that’s not necessarily the case. If a derogatory word is said with enough malicious intent, it’s still offensive. A group of individuals may think writing “slut” on their body may be empowering, in terms of regaining control, but reshaping it doesn’t prevent the damages such a word causes in other situations.,Women should be able to dress however they want, but the focus should be on the act of shaming not on the word.,Words like the N-word, also have historical connotations and meanings associated with them. The N-word, like many other words in the English language, represents years of misuse and trauma.,It’s naïve for a younger generation to attempt to embrace the word, especially if they’ve never been tied to it the same way the previous generation was. No single group has a direct claim over a word; they’re accessible to every member of society.,Even if an associated group tries to take ownership of a word, its potential damage won’t change unless its connotation, both historical and definitive, is completely removed.,So the next time you want to call me a slut in an attempt to empower me, don’t. The focus should be on the issue itself, not on rebranding gimmicks.,Labiba is one of the Editors in Chief at the Journal.

With multiple angles and scenes, it’s more apt at telling a linear plotline.,But I believe a solitary image can be more powerful. Photos can be microcosms for grand world changes, letting viewers see a story through their own interpretation and emotion.,The 2013 World Press Photo of the Year for Spot News, won by Paul Hansen, shows family members weeping as they clutch the bodies of two-year-old Suhaib Hijazi and his four-year-old brother Muhammad.,Casualties of an Israeli airstrike, the bodies are shrouded in cloth as the family carries them down a street in Gaza City in the Palestine Territories.,While some people look at this photo and see a mourning family, others may think of the long-boiling conflict between Israel and Palestine in a land so far from ours.,That’s the thing about photos. They can mean so many different things to different people, shedding light on new perspectives.,It’s not so different from video, is it? But, while videos take your hand and lead them down a set path, a photo becomes the launching point for your own thoughts and ideas.,It’s up to you to build a story from a whisper of a thought from one random photographer.,Photography, though it often consists of Instagram filters and vain self-portraits, can be a very subtle craft.,Those who spend their lives behind the lens understand this. I don’t call myself a photographer, but I know what it’s like to wait for a perfect moment to capture on film, to want to make a moment incarnate in cellulose.,Video is less subtle, allowing for less creativity when it comes to being a storyteller. Photographers must enjoy the challenge. After all, they only have one shot, literally, of telling a story.,It’s how I imagine Hansen must have felt, pointing his camera at that weeping family.,He must have felt the weight of that shutter click. He must have felt their story coming to light.,Janina is the Postscript Editor at the Journal.,,Colin Tomchick,Video,Working with both photo and video on a regular basis, I have found that video provides a better means to tell and share a story.,With the widespread availability of relatively high-quality video cameras built into most everyday electronic devices, video continues to appeal to a vast audience.,It’s only recently that a person could shoot, edit, produce, upload and share a video using tools they likely already have on their phone.,Although the same is true for photos, the nature of photography makes for a somewhat less interesting final product in the hands of an amateur.,For example, if the average person were to try to tell a compelling story about a restaurant they ate lunch at, they would be hard pressed to take a photo or even a series of photos that accurately convey the story being told. In fact, the end result would probably look like the average Instagram feed.,A video, on the other hand, would be able to capture the ambient sound of the restaurant, the kitchen, and the patrons, and include many shots showcasing the visual details of the food or the restaurant that made the experience worth sharing.,It would be terribly incorrect to discount the storytelling ability of a skilled and talented photographer. But now that cameras are widely available, much of the storytelling power of a photo could be lost due to poor lighting, framing or improper use of equipment. In the case of video, the ability to capture sound and movement is usually an asset to even the most amateur of videographers, contrary to photography.,In contrast to photos, videos are naturally suited to telling stories due to their dynamic use of sound. While a photo is a silent, unmoving record of the split-second when the camera shutter was open, video provides the closest analogue for recording and showing events the way that we would naturally remember them.,The nature of video is such that a properly-edited collection of clips can create a cohesive narrative, whereas a series of photos usually requires accompanying information to provide context.,Video simply leaves little room for confusion or interpretation, making it the better story-telling medium at the end of the day.,Colin is the Multimedia Editor at the Journal."},{"title":"City soils relations with students","url":"/story/2013-06-25/editorials/city-soils-relations-students/","date":"June 25, 2013","content":"The vote to exclude students from census data has aggravated an already tenuous relationship between Queen’s students and the City of Kingston.,There’s plenty of blame to go around. The Mayor, Kingston City Council, the AMS and Queen’s students have each done their part to make the situation worse.,Removing students from census data has resulted in a realignment which eliminates Sydenham District and greatly reduces the say that Queen’s students have in city politics. The AMS and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students are right to appeal this decision to the Ontario Municipal Board. Hopefully the appeal will be successful as the City’s decision seems discriminatory.,While the vast majority of Queen’s students don’t live in Kingston full-time, the actions taken by Kingston’s City Council encourage students to completely disregard their responsibilities to the City of Kingston. If Queen’s students are not treated as a constituency, then how can the city have high expectations regarding student behaviour?,Mayor Mark Gerretsen’s immature exchanges on Twitter have not helped matters. If the mayor wants to reach out to students on social media then he should put his best foot forward.,The mayor’s false assertion that he knew that the current AMS executive didn’t vote in the last municipal election (which he’s since apologized for) is representative of an overall dismissive attitude from the City.,Like City Council, Queen’s students need to redouble their efforts to engage in an active and reciprocal town-gown relationship. While Queen’s students are not a homogenous group, many are fairly apathetic about municipal politics.,In this situation, the AMS is partly responsible for student inaction. Student leadership should have made an issue over council’s efforts to exclude students long before they did. Students count on their representatives to foresee potential conflicts and lobby effectively on their behalf.,With so much at stake, the AMS should have been more proactive, but the overall problem rests with the City leadership’s attitude towards students.,The issue is compounded as student say in municipal politics will be greatly reduced if council gets their way.

There will always be demand for full news reports, carefully researched investigative pieces and meticulously crafted features.,The power of a front page, in print, can’t be underestimated. Last week, the front page of the Globe & Mail featured a photo of a 17-year-old female figure skater with her leg raised upright during a routine, sparking widespread furor.,The root of the issue wasn’t the shot itself, but its prominence on the front page of a widely circulated news source. Had the photo merely been included as an addendum to an online article, it wouldn’t have garnered nearly the same attention.,By tabbing it as the centerpiece of a national newspaper, the Globe spurred reaction, ignited controversy — and likely drew in more readers.,Newspapers should focus on the inherent advantages of physical copy — creative layouts that resonate on the printed page and long-form reads that address significant local issues.,Detail, scrutiny and insight are still treasured journalistic traits, especially when they’re legitimated by the history and reputation of an established paper.,Online journalism is an important medium in itself, but it has notable limitations. There’s value to posting breaking news updates and engaging readers through mediums like Twitter, but it’s impossible to provide the full scope of a story in a blurb frantically written for web hits.,Web reporting should serve mostly as a complement to print newspapers.

A study lead by The Poynter Institute, confirms that photos are a dominant entry point during the digestion of printed information.,People commonly don’t have a great attention span for long stories and get lazy reading very textual content.,With the support of photos, the story immediately becomes more visually appealing and attention grabbing. It’s easier for the mind to absorb the content of a photo in a second, than a story or even a headline.,Video content is the next leg up on photography. By simply watching a short one-minute video, you can quickly learn and connect with the given story. Video is simply the most interactive; it has the ability to leave you feeling the most integrated you can be without physically being there.,Regardless of whether content is in print or online, stories will suffer without photo or video. Even though social media and digital content seem to be becoming the latest form of newscasting, multimedia still remain indispensable in the journalism industry.,Photos and videos connect and emote with the reader in ways which words wouldn’t ordinarily be able to.,In a world where technology is booming, multimedia integration in print journalism is becoming critical.

Newspapers have taken note of the public’s love of acquiring knowledge quickly and offered up Twitter-sized bites of information in response. Instead of showing us why they’re better than the material we’re already getting for free, they’ve only stooped to show us why they’re equally as good.,‘People don’t read in-depth pieces anymore,’ journalists cry, as they watch their friends share Deadspin’s 4,000+-word piece on the Manti Te’o debacle.,Whether or not that story or other popular longform blog pieces fit your definition of quality journalism, they’re proof that people will look away from Twitter for long enough to read something longer and deeper if they’re interested enough.,I don’t see myself ever paying for breaking news from any specific source.

It’s not supposed to objectified, it’s supposed to be felt in rather harsh terms — human terms of giving and taking. Haddaway’s lyrics, “Oh baby, don’t hurt me/Don’t hurt me no more” sums up the sort of love people should have.,Love is always happening, it’s unconditional, it’s ever encompassing — it sweeps people together in one moment and drops it like it’s hot the next — repeatedly.,It’s a whole flurry of emotions that involve an element of sacrifice, because when you truly love someone, you don’t express your attraction to them long enough just to get in their pants.

Love can be purely sexual, purely romantic, purely platonic and anything in between.,In today’s society, we should have the increasing freedom to express these feelings in whatever we please, as long as all parties are consenting. Romantic relationships can be polyamorous, homosexual or casual. It’s okay if you want to express your love through romantic gestures that don’t involve sexual intercourse. It’s also okay to celebrate love in a more overtly sexual way by having a massive orgy, if that’s your cup of tea.,We don’t live in the 1950s anymore. Even familial love, with the increase in families with homosexual parents or with adopted children, is shifting in a more unconstrained direction. The variety of romantic relationships in our society enrich it — we shouldn’t attempt to place boundaries on the way people choose to show those feelings.,I’m not trying to say that there is something wrong with being in a heterosexual relationship in the classic sense — that would make me a hypocrite. If that’s the way you choose to love, so be it. But if you and your casual friend with benefits are mutually respectful, consenting and happy with the arrangement, that can be seen as a form of love as well.,Romantic relationships don’t follow a textbook form anymore.

It’s important for employers to avoid hiring people solely because they think they’ll mesh well with other employees.,A diverse workforce with different personalities and skillsets can help an employer maintain a flow of creative ideas and effective work more so than a culturally homogenous workplace.,Employers also need to be weary of ensuring that their interviews promote cultural inclusiveness — the slant of the questions shouldn’t exclude anyone culturally such as new immigrants or individuals who may not have an in-depth understanding of Western culture.,Maintaining a disciplined hiring board and a balanced focus on both social skills and hard skills will ensure that the interview process remains fair.,Keeping these checks and balances in mind, thinking about an employee’s cultural fit in a workplace can lead to a smarter hire and a more productive workplace for all.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Queen’s trails the rest","url":"/story/2013-01-22/editorials/queens-trails-rest/","date":"January 22, 2013","content":"It’s time for Queen’s to meet the new university standard and look further into implementing a co-op program at the school.,Co-op programs, which offer work placements for academic credit, have become increasingly popular at post-secondary schools in the country. There are 37 of these programs in place in Ontario alone.,They equip students with invaluable interview and practical skills which are crucial for this generation, especially given that a university degree alone is often not enough to secure employment for students post graduation.,Universities such as Waterloo provide leading examples of successful co-op programs, offering students paid or unpaid placements at major organizations in their given field of study.,While a co-op program could bring benefits to Queen’s students and Kingston, it’s undeniable that it would cost the school more money.,Waterloo employs over 135 staff to oversee their program and has to employ them full-time in the summer to stay in line with the co-op schedule — something that is surely a costly endeavour.,Queens’ doesn’t necessarily need to create a program as extensive as the one at Waterloo though. The University could pool its existing resources, such as Career Services and the Queen’s University International Centre, to come up with a program uniquely tailored to this school.,A co-op program would benefit not only Queen’s students, but also the larger Kingston community.,As The Kingston Economic Development Corporation outlined in a recent report, the City often laments the fact that Queen’s students rarely stay in Kingston upon graduating. Creating co-op placements in local companies could help retain talent for future employment opportunities.,Co-ops don’t need to be available in every department or every faculty at the school right off the bat. However, the introduction of such a program could allow students who would want to take advantage of co-op opportunities to receive credit for employment.,Co-op programs are increasingly becoming the standard to meet at many colleges and universities; it’s time for Queen’s to join the trend.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Show’s lingerie lacks tact","url":"/story/2012-11-23/editorials/shows-lingerie-lacks-tact/","date":"November 23, 2012","content":"The use of a Navajo headdress in the latest Victoria’s Secret fashion show has become a divisive issue, with some defending the use of cultural symbols in fashion and others calling for a shift away from using them altogether.,After sending Karlie Kloss, a white, European model, down the runway wearing a Navajo headdress and only a bra and panties, the public, Navajo Americans included, have rightfully been less than impressed.,The act is an explicit example of cultural appropriation, where the value of a given cultural symbol is taken out of context.,This isn’t the first time that Victoria’s Secret has gotten in trouble for tokenizing cultures.

Courtships were more committed, more formal and often involved more romantic effort from the man’s side.,Nowadays, the rules of dating have changed and become far more ambiguous.

In bringing up these concerns, the author is correct.,However, the author of the article made some overly simplified implications as to what it means to be racist.,The author clearly states that he believes the foundation of racism is based in whiteness.

Even though the numbers have fallen since 2010, when 175 blue lights were activated without cause, we should aim to return to pre-2008 numbers.,The problem has been partially linked to the existence of some jacket bars, which involve shotgunning a beer at each blue light on campus.,When students are inebriated, especially well into accomplishing the blue light bar requirements, they are far more likely not to consider the consequences of their actions.,It’s this sort of thoughtlessness that needs to be discouraged.,The blue lights serve a very important purpose on campus — a purpose that students may often forget about.,With sexual assaults and violence against students, specifically women, occurring on Canadian university campuses, these blue lights serve as a valuable safety checkpoint for all.,In trivializing the significance of these blue lights by maliciously hitting the emergency button, students are inevitably threatening the integrity of this campus resource.,Blue lights should be on this campus to promote a safer space and environment for all.,By condoning drinking games and glancing over vandalism, Queen’s culture allows for the creation of a dangerous double standard.

Those who live at the hotel are far removed from the Queen’s community, while those living in common rooms lived in cramped conditions.,While many are skeptical about the school spending $70 million on these new residences, it’s a more self-sustaining investment than others that have been made by the administration, such as the Queen’s Centre.,With students paying annual fees to live in residences, the new buildings will pay for themselves in time. There should be a degree of oversight from students and the larger Queen’s community to ensure that the project stays on budget.

With a confusing interface and stricter guidelines for developers, Windows 8 has been lacklustre.,One of the biggest features of Windows 8 is the idea of it being mostly touch-centric.,The interface feels more at home on a tablet or a phone, not a desktop. If desktop users decide to stick with Windows 8, they’ll encounter the steep learning curve of using a mouse and keyboard on something that is designed for touch.,This experience feels undeniably awkward, but is the lesser of two evils when compared to how Windows 8 will affect app development.,What made Windows great in the past was its openness to development. With the strict guidelines of the Windows Store app certification requirements, that openness is now being stripped away. The new Windows Store has complete control over what software can actually be sold.,For example in section 5.1 of the app requirements, it states that no adult content can be contained in an app. While this news may not affect you personally, it affects a vast majority of PC gamers because games like Skyrim would be deemed inappropriate for sale and taken off the Windows Store.,Windows will still allow downloads from third party sources; the new restrictions for Windows 8 application certification may lead some developers to question how much more freedom Microsoft will take away in the future though.,Windows 7 is still sufficient for desktop users.

It’s clear that Windows 8 is an improvement.,Specifically, the operating system is faster at the everyday tasks that people need done, from turning on your computer to copying files.,The most divisive changes in Windows 8 are the numerous visual design choices.

They argue that the basic commands previously found under the start button can’t be so easily relegated.,I disagree. It can normally take anywhere from two to three seconds to move one’s mouse from one part of the screen clicking the start button and then searching for what file or application one’s looking to access.,In Windows 8, a quick tap of the windows key will do the trick.

To start with, increasing class sizes leave room for distraction. Lectures are long, discussion is limited and it’s often difficult for students to stay focused in them. We need to move away from lecture-based learning and towards a blended format.,Courses such as FILM 240 are a prime example of the innovation Queen’s should further aim to champion. In the course, an application called Class Caddy was introduced, making the course material accessible to all students through their smartphones. Students are notified when new course material is uploaded and can access all of the content through their smart devices. Creating these models will let the students go at their own learning pace.,While Queen’s has been technologically ahead of other universities in some capacities, in others, such as platforms like Moodle, we’ve lagged behind. My professors have complained to me in the past about Moodle deleting their students’ information and not updating their marks properly.,As a result of these glitches, they have disregarded the use of the platform and have created their own website to host the material. It seems counterproductive that the admin is spending so much money on a software program that doesn’t even work properly.,It’s time for Queen’s to be a leader of innovation.,App-based learning should be introduced as an alternative to Moodle. Queen’s should create a faculty-specific template to push out course content. Students are already on their smartphones, so it only makes sense for the University to use this platform for educational purposes.,We can build on existing platforms such as TED-ed, a program that uses TED videos to educate students, then evaluates them on what they’ve learned.

Organizations such as PETA are well-known for calling out countless large companies like KFC for their inhumane treatment of animals.,Unfortunately, this campaign might get lost in the noise of all of the other existing animal rights initiatives calling out similar corporate indiscretions.,Where this campaign finds its strength is in its specificity. An initiative of this sort is more likely to bring about change by targeting one company instead of an entire industry.,Regardless of whether Canada Goose’s hunting practices are harmful or not, they have been successful in job creation for Canadians in the hunting and trapping industry. But economic benefit doesn’t negate corporate responsibility.,Such small niche campaigns do provide an important check to corporations’ ethical standards. By raising questions about the way the coyotes are killed for their fur, the campaign could effectively raise awareness about how to create an ethical code for hunting and fur trapping in Canada. If customers demand a more ethical product, companies will likely be more willing to provide it.,The campaign is doing the right thing by starting small. Especially given the targeted nature of Canada Goose’s customer base, the campaign may actually succeed at bringing about changes in the way animals are hunted for their fur in Canada.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Athletic education also belongs in the classroom","url":"/story/2012-11-29/editorials/athletic-education-also-belongs-classroom/","date":"November 29, 2012","content":"Athletes deserve their own sort of college education, both on the field and in the classroom.,In his recently published commentary piece in the Chronicle of Higher Education — an American newspaper specializing in university and college affairs — David Pargman argues that varsity athletes shouldn’t have to waste time on degrees they don’t truly want.,Instead, they should be able to specialize in the sport that they came to school for, earning something like a Bachelors of Arts in Sport Performance if they so please.,Especially in the US, as Pargman outlines, athletes are known to go to college solely for the sake of playing a team sport there — academics may not even come into play. These athletes are unnecessarily forced to pursue degree programs which they’re rarely invested in, wasting their time and money for the sake of being called a ‘student’ athlete.,As Pargman outlines, a specialized sports degree could allow athletes to dedicate their full time to their sport of choice, attending classes about sports psychology, scrimmaging and physiology.,Some might argue that such a degree may not carry much value, especially given that many athletic careers only last a few years, with limited opportunities to achieve great fame and fortune. The same can be said though of many other post-secondary programs.,Specialized programs exist for those who choose to pursue fine art or theatre — all degrees which can result in career paths that are just as competitive, short-lived and seemingly impractical. If structured appropriately, these degrees can still offer specialized, concrete skills that can lead to successful careers.,Students should have the ability to study what they are truly passionate about; currently, many varsity athletes are instead pushed into degrees that they could care less about.,While these sorts of programs may be less relevant in Canada, where university varsity sports don’t carry as much weight, this program could save time and money for countless varsity college athletes, giving them a higher quality university experience in general.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Behavioural grades","url":"/story/2012-11-09/editorials/behavioural-grades/","date":"November 9, 2012","content":"A professor’s decision to deduct 10 per cent for bad behaviour in class has the potential to be constructive, but treads a fine line.,A rule is currently in place in Professor Jill Jacobson’s PSYC 300 course outlining that any disruptive or threatening behavior, either in class or via email, won’t be tolerated towards a fellow student, TA or professor.,It isn’t clear what constitutes this type of behavior. The rule seems too vague to be fairly enforced.,This sort of ambiguity could be worrisome for students participating in the course.,Instead of participating in class and openly disagreeing with the professor, they may instead choose to keep their opinions to themselves for fear of losing grades.,This could be an infringement on academic freedom if the rule isn’t delineated more clearly to all those in the class.,The premise behind the rule isn’t necessarily a bad one.

Someone who is missing teeth or has significant dental damage will understandably be at a disadvantage when looking for a job.,The City had the opportunity to take an exemplary step in instituting this program.,A similar program had been in place three years ago, but was promptly slashed as a result of cutbacks on provincial funding. Reinstating such a program, would give the City an opportunity to not only give individuals in need a second chance in finding employment, but also set an example for other cities in the province to do the same.,It’s true that the $100,000 program would only be helping approximately 35 to 40 people, but the cost is miniscule given the returns it could provide.,Dental work can be extraordinarily expensive, especially when one is uninsured.,The price for reconstructive dental work can reach thousands of dollars per person, depending on their condition — a price tag that many of those who are unemployed can’t afford.,At the end of the day, this program doesn’t guarantee a return on investment. However, it improves accessibility for those who are at a disadvantage — an altruistic and important step that the City should’ve taken.,We build wheelchair ramps for those who need them most — it doesn’t make sense that the City wouldn’t want to do the same for those who could benefit from this program.

While this also suggests that there will be an increase in revenue, it raises many questions as to how exactly the budget will be affected.,Will the programming and planning of services like the ARC and Health, Counselling and Disability Services expand on campus to accommodate this rise in enrolment? Will this revenue help the University balance its budget, or will the money simply get lost as accommodations are made for the new students?,This potential growth also raises skepticism about whether the quality of education will suffer, in light of recent departmental cuts. When planning a project that will inevitably affect many other people and services on campus, such questions have to be answered.,Unfortunately, the Board’s decision to pass the building plans’ budget without consulting all pertinent stakeholders lacked this oversight.,So far, the only investment that’s been made has been planning for these residences, not the actual construction of them.

It only targets those that have joint citizenship with Canada.,The very premise is at risk of being xenophobic, targeting people whose citizenship is from a country that may be suspected of harbouring terrorist activity.,This raises many questions about the intentions of the Bill. It clearly targets Canadian immigrants — especially ones who could be profiled for committing acts of terrorism. The fact that dual citizenship is a necessity implies that local-born Canadians would be less likely to commit such acts, thus strengthening the xenophobic undertones of the bill.,Revoking the citizenship of someone who has committed a crime makes the point that citizenship is a privilege — a point that isn’t necessarily a bad one to make.,There are other ways to deal with those who commit treason, such as life in jail, exorbitant fines and general societal exile.,The way the concluding statistic was reached is also problematic — the poll was done over the phone and included only 1,000 people.,Little information was given as to what part of Canada these 1,000 citizens were from, how the questions were asked and what demographic they represented.,Currently, the Bill hasn’t even made it to second reading and it’s rare for private members’ bills to make it through.,Canada doesn’t need a xenophobic law like this when there are already punitive measures in place to deal with perpetrators of treason.,Let’s hope the discussion ends here.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Deserved compensation","url":"/story/2012-10-19/editorials/deserved-compensation/","date":"October 19, 2012","content":"The upcoming remuneration review should focus on limiting undue burden on AMS salaried student positions.,Earliest this term, the AMS Board of Directors proposed the review to conduct a comprehensive examination of salaries and job descriptions in the AMS.,Many of these positions require students to work past their basic job description.,In return, they earn close to minimum wage — a small sum per hour given the amount of overtime put in.,It’s also undeniable that the sum these employees earn is far lower from what other student government staff earn elsewhere.,At McMaster, for example, some student leaders earn between $33,000 to $36,000 a year — about $10,000 more than the highest paid positions at the AMS.,McMaster, admittedly, is a larger school, with more students paying the essential student fee going to the salaries of student executives. This kind of discrepancy puts AMS salaries in perspective.,The AMS-specific student fee at Queen’s, currently $70.18, is designated in part to pay the salaries of AMS.,In 2009, Queen’s passed an incremental $120 student fee hike spread over three years for the Athletics Centre. It seems ironic that we’re willing to have our student leaders receive minimal pay while other, more luxurious ventures take a leading focus.,Although the reality is that Queen’s has a smaller population, limiting the possibility of raising the fee, it’s worth revisiting our priorities.,Unlike other student government representatives, AMS staff have to take courses on top of their existing duties. This cuts into their already menial salaries.,Even though their pay is low, most students are unaware. The numbers are lost in translation as they aren’t directly communicated to the student body. While the budget is available on the AMS website, it doesn’t differentiate specific amounts for individual salaries. Students deserve to know the exact numbers, especially given that they’re paying them through their student fees.,It’s unlikely that anyone works for the AMS expecting to get rich — it’s a drive for earning valuable experience and a passion for serving students that leads most individuals to pursue these low-paying positions.,When conducting this review, the Personnel Committee should take the financial concerns of these students into consideration.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Fraternal skeptics","url":"/story/2012-10-26/editorials/fraternal-skeptics/","date":"October 26, 2012","content":"The AMS’ revisitation of the ban on their members joining fraternities is a step forward — one that doesn’t necessarily imply that fraternities will be welcomed back at Queen’s.,The ban, instituted in 1934, hasn’t been properly re-evaluated since its inception.

Warning and educating youth as early as elementary school can help reduce the risks they may face online.,However, the problem doesn’t only lie in the Internet.

Instead of spending money at Starbucks for lunch, she handed the lady a $20 bill. Yesterday, she went to the grocery store and found $20 on the pavement in the parking lot — immediately she thought about the lady.,While this may seem like a lucky coincidence, for my family and I, this forms the foundation of a system of belief.,I grew up Buddhist. In my faith, we believe in karma niyama, the order of act and result. Basically, you get what you give and, in turn, you give what you get.,In a sense, karma is a part of faith. But, for me, it’s also a way to restore some sort of balance in life. Believing in karma forces you to reflect on your actions and how they may affect those around you. This ultimately leads individuals to be better towards one another and to be constructive and thoughtful in the way they act.,Karma also dictates that things happen for a reason. This very idea helps me take responsibility for my own happiness, as well as my own misery. As a life philosophy, it helps me deal with the tough times and encourages me to fight through them while continuing to do good.,Believing in karma can help individuals deal with difficult times, while retaining a positive outlook.,People may question its accuracy — after all karma isn’t proven by science — but it allows people to be conscious of the consequences of their actions and, ultimately, can make our society a better and more thoughtful place.,Tiffany is the Associate Photo Editor at the Journal."},{"title":"Critical spirit","url":"/story/2012-10-23/editorials/critical-spirit/","date":"October 23, 2012","content":"Queen’s has a celebrated school spirit, but few take time to think about its implications.,Every year, newly admitted students are thrust into the traditions of the University during Orientation Week.,Having arrived at Queen’s as a frosh, I was bombarded with Queen’s paraphernalia and up-beat cheers — all methods of welcoming a new class to the University.,Orientation Week can be a great resource, helping students transition into the University.,But many of these events don’t create much space for students to think critically about Queen’s.

I came to Queen’s to develop my own voice — not have it drowned out by others.,University should be a place of social and intellectual growth.

I didn’t tell him he was wrong because I wasn’t sure that he was.,The professor ultimately let me submit the paper, but I held onto his words for years, playing them over in my mind whenever I had to shamefully ask for “special treatment” to accommodate my illness.,I also remembered the words of friends who told me they thought people with mental illness should just stop “whining about their problems.” I’d been made to feel ashamed, and that shame often prevented me from seeking the help I so badly needed.,The root of these feelings was the thing we’ve all heard so much about: stigma.,The way we talk about stigma reminds me of something novelist Teju Cole wrote in a March essay in The Atlantic.,In the essay, he notes that although we’re talking more about issues like racism, misogyny and homophobia, we’re still hesitant to actually call anyone racist, misogynistic or homophobic.,But oppression can’t exist without oppressors, just as stigma can’t exist without stigmatizers.,If we’re going to continue this dialogue on stigma, we need to stop being afraid of calling it out when we see it.,Accusing someone of stigmatizing may cause hurt feelings, but the risks of its continued perpetration are far greater.,Holly is the News Editor at the Journal."},{"title":"Bring the ‘stache","url":"/story/2012-11-02/editorials/bring-stache/","date":"November 2, 2012","content":"Mo bros and sistas, it’s time to rally.,Each November, men from around the world don moustaches in solidarity, eschewing general facial cleanliness in support of prostate cancer awareness and other men’s health initiatives.,Founded in Australia in 2003, the global Movember campaign has grown exponentially ever since, with over 850,000 registrants in 2011.,Each one of us has been directly affected by cancer, man’s greatest unrelenting opponent — and each of us can make an individual imprint on the face of men’s health.,Last year, my floormates and I held a post-Movember extravaganza called the Muzzies. We suited up in formal attire, booked a common room and handed out awards to each participant, ranging from Most Valuable Moustache to more colourful offshoots.,Not only did the Muzzies foster competition among us to see who could grow the largest, thickest or most delightfully repugnant moustache, but it also provided an incentive to harass our families, friends and casual acquaintances for monetary pledges.,Just as we sought to one-up our teammates, we worked in conjunction to boost our fundraising efforts, totaling almost $900. Our “mo’s” served as a personal rallying point for male health initiatives — a cause that hinges on the grassroots efforts of its supporters.,The stakes are high. Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among Canadian men. One in every seven of us will develop prostate cancer, and one in 28 will die of it.,Without sufficient funding and research, cancer’s toll will never be alleviated.

The Canadian campaign generated $41.9 million in donations last year — 89.6 per cent of which was allocated to men’s health programs. By giving to Movember, millions of dollars are funneled directly into the pervasive fight against cancer.,This year, my friends and I will contribute to a fraction of that total.

Heads of cabbage have been known to cost upwards of $25, while cases of 24 water bottles reach over $100, according to one Huffington Post article.,It’s understandable then that, if one can buy food at a cheaper price in the same town that offers the needed medical services, the nurses would take advantage of the opportunity.,If they were purchasing food for other members of the community to help them save money as well, then their actions would be more justifiable.,However, these flights have seemingly far less innocent motives.,Nurses in this region are able to arrange urgent medical transport outside of regular working hours. The report accuses the nurses of using these trips which require more resources than pre-planned trips, solely for the sake of getting groceries.,Furthermore, by choosing what’s reported to be the most expensive airline, Keeper River Airways, instead of two cheaper available alternatives, the nurses cost the government much more money than necessary.,The actions of the nurses in question demonstrate a clear lack of judgment. Instead of flying to the nearest town, which was only a 12-minute journey away, the nurses would often fly to a town over twice as far without giving any solid explanation to their reasoning, the investigation reports.,In total, this led to an excess of over $650,000 spent on flights — flights that were used for solely selfish purposes.,The abuse of the emergency flights is a waste of money for the government, for taxpayers, and, ultimately, for those living in Northern communities whose precious medical resources are being squandered.,—Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Car chase suicide raises questions","url":"/story/2012-10-02/editorials/car-chase-suicide-raises-questions/","date":"October 2, 2012","content":"A recent live car chase ending in the unexpected suicide of the individual being chased has raised questions about the media’s relationship to violence.,Specifically, the fine line between acceptable levels of violence and what’s plain wrong has inevitably been placed under increased scrutiny.,The uproar lies in Fox New’s mistake in airing live footage of a suicide and failing to use its five-second delay effectively,This is a grave mistake on the part of the news station — one that they fully admitted to and apologized for.,They should’ve caught the event with the five-second delay and cut away as quickly as possible.,Part of the problem has to do with the inherent nature of a car chase being aired live on TV — it toes a fine line between news and entertainment.,Viewers watch it for the thrill and danger of it. It’s never fully predictable how the chase will end, or what sort of violence may ensue as a result. The live viewing also adds to the suspense and risk of the whole situation — one that can end poorly for all involved.,Although any violence shown without warning on TV is problematic, the type of violence that occurred on air — a horrific, personal moment — inevitably contributed to the outrage. A suicide is a private, tragic event — airing it on live TV is not only disrespectful to the individual who took their own life, but is also disrespectful to the viewer.,While a car crash, or a shoot-out might have been seen as a more classic part of the car chase — an element that viewers might suspect or even hope for as part of the thrill — a suicide can only be seen as terrible.,Ultimately, the whole scene raises questions about our media’s relationship to violence.,How much violence is acceptable? What can viewers really stomach? How much warning can a channel really give?,While our society has become desensitized to many types of violence on TV, a suicide is deeply personal and ultimately doesn’t belong on the TV screens of the entire public out of respect for the perpetrator and the viewer.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"More than folders","url":"/story/2012-09-21/editorials/more-folders/","date":"September 21, 2012","content":"The new mental health initiative, Green Folders, is a good step forward, but will hopefully be followed by more ambitious and effective projects.,The folders, which offer a four-sided page of resources on warning signs for a variety of mental health issues, definitely help to increase awareness about mental healthcare on campus.,Most professors and TAs have little to no knowledge on these issues, so it gives them a gateway to recognize and address problems that are clearly visible in their classes.,That being said, a folder still only provides very limited resources — four pages doesn’t encompass all of the stressors and difficulties that students may face.,On top of that, mental health issues are unfortunately not always clearly on display in class.,A folder won’t teach professors how to build closer, more caring relationships with their students — that would require a larger cultural shift in teaching on campus.,The school could easily take further steps towards helping train faculty and staff to deal with these sorts of issues more effectively.,For example, with accessibility issues at Queen’s, an online training was set up to give people resources on how to cater to someone with specific accessibility needs. While the online aspect of it can lead people to engage less actively with the material they’re supposed to learn, the intention of implementing a training model is a positive one.,Enrolling each professor and TA into a special seminar or course offered by the university to help them understand and pinpoint mental health issues, while also teaching them to reach out to students and create a safe space, would be a good next step.,One thing is undeniable — it’ll be far more constructive than simply handing them a four-page folder of information.

Although there’s been an emphasis on increased discussion and awareness, these problems are not going away.,A recently proposed gay-centric high school in Toronto would provide undeniable benefits to LGBTQ students who may otherwise face bullying or ignorance in their regular public schools.,While some public high schools have dealt with these issues better than others, a separate gay-centric school would offer students a respite from dealing with the negative repercussions of going to schools where being gay isn’t as well-understood and accepted.,The school would be the first of its kind in Toronto, helping to better the lives of many students who might not feel safe in their own home schools.,Since the proposal is still in its infancy, other options should be considered.,One can still create a positive space within existing public schools by facilitating a discussion amongst students themselves, regardless of their sexual identity.,By integrating LGBTQ-positive curriculums or establishing alliance clubs directly in public schools, this involves all parties — the bullies and those who are being bullied.,It ultimately educates everyone on stigma reduction, creating a more permanent solution to the problem of LGBTQ discrimination. A separate gay-centric school, on the other hand, risks denying the rest of society a discussion and education on these issues.,While a discussion in every public school is important, a gay-centric school might provide more immediate relief for students who are currently feeling unsafe and discriminated against in their high school.,At the end of the day, what’s important is that young people in the LGBTQ community feel safe and accepted in their secondary school environment, whatever form that may take.

Very few people know why Professor Mason took an extended leave of absence or whether or not the administration had any role in it.,With little comment from the administration, the issue was quickly swept under the rug.,The rejection of the report only shows a further effort by Queen’s to avoid dealing with difficult conversations that address these issues for the sake of protecting their public image.,It’s been a bad couple of years for Queen’s image with highly publicized mental health issues and controversies from Fauxcoming to Queen’s Bands.,Whether or not CAUT’ allegations against the administration are true, the decision makers at Queen’s owe it to their students to admit to or at least discuss their actions. The only way to grow and to ensure that everyone’s rights are being respected — whether students or faculty — is through having these sorts of difficult conversations openly.,Queen’s rejection of the CAUT’ report isn’t the right step to take — a larger, more transparent investigation needs to take place, where everyone can finally get a response to the questions no one wants to answer.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Read with me","url":"/story/2012-09-28/editorials/read-me/","date":"September 28, 2012","content":"Reading is my job.,Between time spent working for the Journal and finishing my English degree, I spend over 40 hours per week looking at some sort of text.,It made for a struggle when I, someone who developed eyesight problems because I ignored my mother’s pleas to “get my nose out of that book,” was forced to stop reading for fun.

The Board of Directors attempted to justify their decision by touting the necessity of being cost-effective in trying to reduce CFRC’s deficit.,While the Board’s financially-based decision isn’t unheard of, the way they went about it — without consultation or notice — is unreasonable and paternalistic. The Board’s actions demonstrate a lack of oversight and a focus on short-term gain over long-term loss for the radio station.,Had they been more transparent about the process, potential long-term repercussions for the business relations of the station could have been minimized.,As a result of Mngoma’s firing, CFRC estimates a $7,000 loss in cash revenue and in-kind deals which will have inevitable ripple effects on those who have done or planned on doing business with the radio station.,In any business, it takes time to build trusting relationships with clients. By hiring a part-time honoraria-based replacement mid-semester, these relationships will inevitably suffer.,When the volunteer is hired, the station will be forced to train them from scratch in the midst of the semester, leaving them in a weaker position than they were in prior to Mngoma’s firing. The firing comes in the wake of the Board rejecting CFRC’s proposed budget in August. Two months later, the Board made their firing decision and presented the station with a revised budget which had significant changes to the business side.,The relationship between the radio station and the AMS has been strained for months — one that’s further complicated given recent events. If there was a disagreement amongst the two parties regarding the station’s budget outline and spending of deficit coverage, more negotiations should have taken place before firing the business manager without consultation.,In the Board’s eyes, the station’s financial situation was too dire to not intervene — they were simply cutting off part of what they viewed as the infected limb.,CFRC’s financial situation however wasn’t new to the Board and it seems strange that they would opt to fire Mngoma at the start of October rather than before the fall semester had begun.,The planned replacement, a 15-hour-a-week volunteer, seems like an illogical way forward for a station in need of revenue to combat their deficit. While profits from campus radio advertisements are admittedly minimal when compared to other forms of media, Mngoma had brought in $3,000 in revenue to the station in his five months in the role. The $10,000 cut to CFRC’s budget that the firing is expected to result in won’t be enough to minimize the long-term effects a shaky business year could have on the station.,At 90 years, CFRC is one of the oldest radio stations in Canada and its historic importance to Queen’s and the Kingston community is something worth preserving.,CFRC is only an AMS service until 2014, after which the AMS will cease to cover any of its debt, which has consistently been between $15,000 and $20,000 for the past six years.,As the body that oversees CFRC’s finances, the Board was legally in the right. But, just because it had the power to fire Mngoma, doesn’t mean that it should have done so without consulting CFRC first. Of course CFRC isn’t blameless in the situation. Realizing their financial situation was dire, after multiple years of having a deficit, the station should have taken more action earlier on.,The troubling reality that the AMS Board has the power to make this kind of rash decision in the first place is something CFRC should have publically objected to and attempted to get overturned earlier.,It’s up to students to determine what they want to see thrive on campus. Although CFRC will only be an AMS service for the next two years, students deserve a say in the future of their campus radio station. While the Board attempted to make a financially responsible decision, the lack of consideration they showed CFRC throughout the process is reprehensible and ultimately takes agency away from those who truly deserve it most in this situation — students and CFRC’s staff.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"Motherly matters & teaching duties","url":"/story/2012-09-18/editorials/motherly-matters-and-teaching-duties/","date":"September 18, 2012","content":"A woman breastfeeding her child shouldn’t be a shocking sight — except when it’s a professor doing it in the middle of their lecture.,Recently, a professor teaching Sex, Gender and Culture at Washington D.C.’s American University caused significant uproar in the media for breastfeeding her sick infant daughter while teaching.,The media ultimately has made far too big of a deal of this issue.

She had two roles to fulfill — being a mother and teaching her students.,As a mother, she needs to take care of her sick child.,As an educator, it’s her job to make sure that her students are retaining the information she’s teaching.,This professor placed one role above the other by failing to recognize that some of her students might be uncomfortable with her breastfeeding in public.

While Queen’s needs to be realistic with their fiscal planning, quality cannot be cut for the sake of good business.,The last thing that should be sacrificed in this culture of cuts and austerity is the student’s learning experience in the classroom.,Unfortunately, this isn’t the time to expect our University administration to produce an ideal educational model, given the economic climate.,The best course of action for the administration in attaining high-quality education is to support the spirit of the province’s Discussion Paper in its present form, work to find innovative ways to cut costs through online platforms while still running a financially viable institution.,— Journal Editorial Board"},{"title":"More than hospital beds","url":"/story/2012-09-14/editorials/more-hospital-beds/","date":"September 14, 2012","content":"Eating disorders and mental illnesses are clearly issues that receive far too little funding and attention in our community.,However, throwing money at the issues isn’t what’s going to solve them.,In a recent article published by the National Post, Sam Rashid laments the lack of funding that is available for the treatment of eating disorders, specifically, the fact that there are only 10 hospital beds allocated to treating patients with eating disorders in the entire GTA area.,Eating disorders are complex problems — while there are many associated physical health risks that can be treated in a hospital, many of the roots of the illness require more than just a hospital bed to overcome them.,For some, outpatient treatment centres and community support networks have proven to be safer, more comfortable places for recovery and treatment Unfortunately, these centres are also extremely underfunded and lack resources, with waitlists that go on for months. The debate over funding can be circular. Many things, especially in the medical field are underfunded — the treatment of so many illnesses would benefit from greater financial investment.,Funding aside though, by changing the conversation surrounding the issues, there are things that can be done to help those suffering from eating disorders.,Eating disorders are mental illnesses and face the undeniable stigma of being a “privileged” problem.,There’s a stereotype that only ‘poor little rich girls’ suffer from these issues — a stigma that’s counterproductive in the fight to overcome them.,It’s the responsibility of community leaders — teachers, politicians and parents — to discuss these issues and create a safe space for those suffering from them within their own communities.,We need to paint this issue as more than just a privileged problem.

It’s taking the Ontario school system to court over this issue, with ludicrously wasteful legal fees estimated to be anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000.,Knowing what teachers plan on teaching in advance isn’t an outrageous demand. It’s fair for parents to have an idea of what their kids will be learning.,However, this particular group’s request is based on hateful, homophobic premises. They want to be alerted of the teacher’s lesson plans in the case that their child will be taught about gay rights or LGBTQ issues so that they can pull them out of class in advance or warn their kids about what they are about to be taught.,They argue that, by placing these sorts of issues on their curriculum, Ontario school boards are being disrespectful to those of a Judeo-Christian faith.,This is wrong. The school system is merely educating students about one aspect of Canadian society.,In teaching children about LGBTQ issues, the system encourages understanding and respect for many cultures, religions and identities in our society, lessons which encourage the appreciation of everyone’s differences are a positive way forward.,Last year, the Toronto District School Board took a positive step in releasing an anti-homophobia curriculum guide which advised teachers not to notify parents as to whether they’d be discussing gender discrimination or homophobia. By pulling their children out of these lessons, parents will be stunting their children’s understanding of the very society they live in.,Especially in Canadian public schools, students will inevitably come from different backgrounds. Our education system shouldn’t teach students to be further divided amongst themselves. It should teach students about the human rights of others.,Teachers who make a point to include messages of inclusion in their lesson plans aren’t brainwashing kids to hate the Bible, or teaching them to disrespect people of a certain faith.

Specifically, much concern has been raised about the potential that a men’s centre could simply turn into a frat house — a place for men to make misogynistic jokes, play video games and watch sports.,It’s ultimately unfair to assume that this will happen — it creates negative stereotypes that deny the use a men’s centre could have on a university campus.,Men, just as women, face countless gendered societal pressures. Much of machismo culture denies men the safe space to discuss their vulnerabilities and personal issues with one another. This has led to much higher suicide and alcoholism rates among men compared to women. Homosexual or transsexual men face societal stigmas on top of this.,A men’s centre can be used to create a safe space for men to discuss their problems, helping to fight the stigmas that they encounter on a day-to-day basis.,But, in order for such an environment to be created, a significant amount of oversight must be implemented by the students and university members involved in the centre’s creation.,A clear mandate must be outlined for the centre, with an appropriate level of funding allocated – $30,000, which is the amount currently recommended, seems excessive for the proposed purposes of the centre.,Furthermore, students and administrators must hold the centre to account, ensuring that it’s used as a safe space to discuss issues that men face. Otherwise it risks morphing into a boys’ club that only furthers patriarchal values and negative stereotypes.,The creation of a men’s centre shouldn’t stifle the prevalence or importance of women’s issues, or issues facing other marginalized groups on campus. A dialogue about gender issues facilitated through the men’s centre would add a positive element to its creation.,For equality’s sake, men, just as women, should have a safe space allocated to them to discuss and cope with the societal stigmas that they may face.,If the men’s centre at Simon Fraser University can establish an environment that fits the above criteria, its creation and funding will be justifiable.,— Journal Editorial Board "},{"title":"Students deserve a genuine Homecoming","url":"/story/2012-05-28/editorials/students-deserve-unaltered-return/","date":"May 28, 2012","content":"The University Council’s recent decision to recommend the restoration of Homecoming is long overdue.

But, if the university’s senior administrators take stronger measures to mitigate the street party and the revelry surrounding the event, they may risk altogether eliminating the essence of Homecoming that is so well-loved and missed by students and alumni.,The administration needs to trust that students and alumni alike will realize the consequences of their actions and behave in an appropriate fashion during future homecomings.,Students shouldn’t have to be babied with a watered-down version of Homecoming — they deserve to have the most missed parts of the celebration such as the football game, the parade and the festivities surrounding the event restored.,Alternatives to the street party, such as sanctioned events at Alfie’s, have the potential to be successful if marked appropriately. The University can also adopt previously used measures such as establishing safe drinking tents with volunteers on hand giving out water and red cups to prevent broken bottles to maintain a safe environment.,In deciding whether to follow the Council’s recommendation, and potentially reinstitute Homecoming, senior administrators should be mindful of what Homecoming means to students and alumni.,We’ll now encounter the first graduating class that has yet to experience a true homecoming.

It’s an idea that’s meant to increase productivity in an economy — an idea that should also be transferred to how young people pick careers and university degrees.,The reason I didn’t pursue a degree in engineering was because I’m no good with math, chemistry or physics and quite frankly, I have very little interest in the field.

It’s patronizing to reduce homelessness to a stereotype and brushes over complex issues.,There’s no doubt that the funds raised will be put to good use, but the campaign may have added to the stigmatization of homeless people.,Dressing in an orange uniform to solicit donations reduces homelessness to a spectacle, an object of pity that needs to be rescued. It ignores the multitude of causes that lead to homelessness, such as addiction, abuse, or a plethora of other circumstances.,Asking for money at the corner of University Avenue and Union Street is an effective way to raise funds, but the 5 Days for the Homeless campaign didn’t make an adequate attempt to educate people on what it really means to be homeless.,Extra money to the Kingston Youth Shelter will repair beds and bathrooms, but it won’t affect homelessness’ root causes.,The campaign had good intentions, but it needs to make changes if it takes place again. Uniforms need to be dropped — homeless people aren’t a unified group with matching outfits. Sleeping outside for five days needs to be rethought as well.,It shouldn’t be necessary to take part in a spectacle to raise money for a cause, and emulation shouldn’t be a condition of empathy.,The Kingston Youth Shelter will benefit substantially from the 5 Days for the Homeless campaign and that in itself made the campaign worthwhile. Homelessness though is an ongoing issue that requires a multi-pronged approach. Kingston requires better infrastructure, including an increased number of youth shelters in the city. Education and awareness of issues surrounding homelessness are also essential.,Charity campaigns often have the best intentions and positive outcomes — something that proved true for 5 Days for the Homeless.

After receiving notice in an email, BFA students cited a lack of consultation as a major concern.,Those with a vested interest in the BFA program are entitled to another opinion and deserve to know where the law falls on the issue. While Queen’s legal counsel Diane Kelly was consulted for her opinion on the issue, it’s important that the lawyer be an independent operator, rather than a University employee.,Cutting a program necessitates giving input to those who are most invested in the decision — this includes students and faculty members.,It’s unlikely the lawyer who’s hired will suggest a reversal of the Nov. 9 decision, but another opinion could spur the creation of a University policy that better outlines program suspension processes.,A similar situation happened in 2009 when the University cut programs with 25 or fewer concentrators. A response came from the Queen’s University Faculty Association who asked lawyer and Queen’s professor David Mullan to investigate.,Mullan’s legal opinion was that there should be a consultative process between the Dean and Senate before a decision is made to cut or suspend a program. It’s an example of the differing opinions that exist when determining a program’s future.,Suspending the BFA program was a fiscal decision, one that the University had the right to make. The problem with administrators’ deliberation was that it didn’t include significant consultation with Senate. Mullan’s advice needs to be respected. This would mean that for a program to be suspended, a consultative, rather than a unilateral decision must be made.,At best the Senate decision to hire an independent legal opinion will force the University to be more collaborative.,As a private institution, the University has the right to govern itself as it wishes, but administrators have a responsibility to be transparent with students, who form the basis of its operations.,The effects of hiring a third-party lawyer remain to be seen, but hopefully it will mean that in the future programs can’t be cut without due consultation."},{"title":"Pageant rules need revamp","url":"/story/2012-03-30/editorials/pageant-rules-need-revamp/","date":"March 30, 2012","content":"Miss Universe Canada announced on March 23 that 23-year-old contestant Jenna Talackova was removed from the competition for failing to comply with the competition’s guidelines.

In 2010, Talackova represented Canada at Miss International Queen, a transsexual/transgender beauty pageant held in Thailand where she placed as a finalist.,The Miss Universe pageant had a chance to step up and make a bold political statement. Instead, they shied away, bringing brought into question the competition’s relevance.,Beauty pageants can be written off as vain competitions that seek to fulfill male fantasies, but they can also be fulfilling for those who see them as an opportunity for empowerment.,Miss Universe is meant to represent the ideal of feminine beauty and Talackova’s disqualification is discrimination. It amounts to stating that transgender women aren’t real women and aren’t beautiful in the ideal feminine sense.,What the disqualification ignores is that a single ideal of feminine beauty simply doesn’t exist.,There doesn’t seem to be logical reasoning behind the pageant’s decision. If being born male gave an unfair advantage to a contestant then it may be grounds for disqualification, as in some sporting events. But being born male doesn’t provide a leg up in a competition of feminine beauty.,If someone identifies as a woman, it shouldn’t be necessary to check her birth certificate or baby photos.

The public outcry gives the pageant more power than it deserves in deciding what’s beautiful. Miss Universe is a competition married to archaic ideas and norms that simply aren’t relevant anymore.,The Miss Universe pageant can set contest rules, but to stay relevant, pageant organizers should revamp their qualifications to fit evolving views on beauty and femininity.,“I regard myself as a woman with a history,” Talackova said during her interview for Miss International Queen.

Academics need to be the primary focus of the University, but experience matters as much as grades.,Clubs and other campus involvement provide valuable learning experiences that aren’t available in the classroom. Queen’s is a school where students are heavily involved, and having a record of activities would be helpful.,Adopting the co-curricular record indicates that the University values more than just academics, and gives employers a legitimate record of involvement.,But the co-curricular record also carries with it a host of potential problems. Collecting the information of every club and deciding what activities are legitimate to place on a transcript would necessitate a large investment of time and money.,Co-curricular records could also inspire people to superficially engage with activities, doing just enough to qualify for their transcript, but not really getting involved.,Because the co-curricular record is a new concept, it remains to be seen whether or not employers and graduate study programs would place value in it.,It’s possible that introducing the program wouldn’t have any real benefits.,The record is a concept that has pros and cons on each side.

The police entered with a search warrant in relation to Smickle’s cousin, who they believed was in possession of illegal firearms.,Ontario Superior Court judge Anne Molloy concluded that in Smickle’s case, enforcing mandatory gun laws would constitute “cruel and unusual punishment.” The flexibility Molloy showed was prudent, and punishing Smickle with the mandatory three-year sentence would have done more harm than good. The Conservative push for mandatory gun-crime sentences was approved by Parliament in 2008.,Instead of three years in prison, Smickle was sentenced to five months under house arrest, in addition to the seven months he spent in pre-trial custody, reported the Post.,Incarcerating someone for what was described as “adolescent preening” doesn’t send the tough-on-crime message promoted by mandatory sentences.

Justice Molloy’s decision in this case is a good example of why sentencing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Mandatory minimum sentences fail to take into account mitigating circumstances.,Incarcerating Smickle wouldn’t prevent him from possessing a gun in the future — it didn’t even belong to him in the first place. To punish Smickle for a simple act of foolishness would be an embarrassment to our justice system. He had no criminal record and poses no threat to public safety.,Pushing Smickle out of work, away from his daughter and fiancée, could do more to propagate a criminal lifestyle than deter it.,Justice Molloy’s decision is a necessary undermining of mandatory minimum sentences, and giving Smickle three years for his crime would have been unfair.,If we don’t discriminate between a hardened criminal and a Facebook fool, then the justice system has failed."},{"title":"London riot not an anomaly","url":"/story/2012-03-23/editorials/london-riot-not-anomaly/","date":"March 23, 2012","content":"St. Patrick’s Day festivities included the usual blend of mirth and drinking last weekend, but at Fanshawe College in London, Ont., celebrations in the student neighborhood turned into a riot.,On March 17, revelers on Fleming Street, a student-dense area near the college, flipped a CTV news van and lit it on fire. The 1,000-strong crowd fed the flame long into the night, ripping apart fences and uprooting trees.,When police attempted to break up the crowd, bottles, bricks and other debris were thrown at them.,The riot, which caused an estimated $100,000 in damage, according to a Mar. 19 CBC article, was a gross and destructive event. But the riot shouldn’t be regarded as a permanent scar on Fanshawe or London’s reputation.,A riot like this can happen anywhere, and it has. Queen’s students themselves have been responsible for a frenzied crowd, demonstrated by years of Aberdeen Street parties on Homecoming.,When a large crowd, alcohol and police presence mixtogether, riots are the result. It’s time for the police to reconsider how they deal with crowds, and recognize that marching into an area with riot gear isn’t the best course of action.,A group of armoured police gives any crowd a common enemy, and it’s even more pronounced among students, who have a strong culture and history of rebelling against the police. Removing that perceived enemy makes it harder for a crowd to rise up together and cause havoc.,Fanshawe President Howard Rundle has suggested that the long-term solution to problems like the St. Patrick’s Day’s riot is to break up the Fanshawe Student Ghetto. The suggestion is troubling, and it would be best to encourage students to act responsibly rather than take away their community space.,Living in a neighborhood with a common culture is a memorable part of life at university. The student lifestyle though, is a privilege and not a right. Nearby families shouldn’t have to be afraid on St. Patrick’s Day, worrying their homes will be damaged or their property destroyed.,If students prove that they’re unable to live safely together, then integrating students housing into a larger city could improve the situation.

It would simply be pushing them into an uncertain labour market at a faster rate.,Changing degree lengths is a significant undertaking and requires substantial changes to the curricula at each institution. A study released on Feb. 21 by the Higher Edcuation Strategy Associates, an arm’s length provincial research and advisory group, stated that a three-year degree may not even reduce costs.

Having year-round class is detrimental to students who use the summer months for full-time employment. Losing four months to work could be a hard hit on student budgets.,Having half of a degree’s credits earned online would be a loss for quality of education.

The protesters had as much right to demonstrate as Charles Rice had to speak about his beliefs.,Disagreeing with someone’s opinions isn’t grounds for telling them to be quiet.

Paying homeless people for living in a home doesn’t secure stable employment to ensure permanent housing.,O’Flaherty’s proposal also misses a step in its economic rationale.

Along with providing access to information, the Human Library program shows that human books are more than their title suggests.,Libraries have struggled to maintain relevance in a time where an infinite amount of information is available online.,The Human Library program allows libraries to expand their role. Libraries are no longer just places of learning but also community centres.,The Human Library is a chance for people to have conversations and learn from another’s subjective experience. Having a personal conversation with a police officer or a refugee, two of the people partaking in the program, would provide a glimpse at a life that’s otherwise unknown.,Speaking with someone for 20 minutes doesn’t provide a full understanding of his or her life, but a conversation can provide a chance for unconventional learning.,Research collected in books is born from compiling subjective experience. Primary sources, like the volunteers telling their stories are the foundations that books are built upon.,The volunteers may not have the authority that a well-researched book has, but the human books can enlighten people in a different way. Listening to a story has a different effect than simply reading an account and first-hand experience has a distinct value alongside academic books."},{"title":"Journal endorses GPP by single vote","url":"/story/2012-01-31/editorials/journal-endorses-gpp-single-vote/","date":"January 31, 2012","content":"Team GPP won the Journal’s endorsement by one vote.,Presidential candidate Rico Garcia, vice-presidential candidate of operations Duncan Peterson and vice-presidential candidate of university affairs T.K. Pritchard form a well-rounded, cohesive team.,After conducting interviews with all three teams, the Journal’s Editorial Board cast nine votes for team GPP and eight for team JDL. Team RMS received five votes and there were two abstentions.,Team GPP offers the best option as a whole, but their platform lacks the specific ideas of team JDL — comprised of presidential candidate Doug Johnson, VP university affairs candidate Mira Dineen and VP operations candidate Tristan Lee.,While GPP offers a run-of-the-mill platform, the team makes up for a lack of creativity with personality.,Each member of GPP is humble enough to be open to feedback, criticism and concerns. T.K. Pritchard is the strongest member of the team. He displays intense dedication to the welfare of the student body and would effectively lobby student interests. His wealth of experience and friendly personality make him the best choice for VP of university affairs.,Team GPP’s weakest link is presidential candidate Rico Garcia. It’s unclear how effective he’ll be at standing up for students and negotiating with the University. If Garcia is elected, he needs to assert himself. He stated that one of his greatest skills is knowing how and when to listen, but the AMS president also needs a keen sense of when to speak up. Garcia’s $100,000 alpine tower proposal last year — shortly before he took office as Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) president — was concerning, but he admitted it as a mistake when asked about his flaws.,Duncan Peterson, team GPP’s candidate for VP of operations has worked with a large budget before as vice-president for ASUS. He has good managerial skills, and gave quantifiable answers regarding his mistakes and shortcomings. He’ll be a capable VP of operations.,It’s unfortunate though that Peterson’s competitor, Tristan Lee, doesn’t have a stronger team.,Lee showed a considerable knowledge of business management and a sharp financial acumen. He’s the best candidate for VP of operations. Working as Common Ground’s head manager, Tristan drastically reduced the service’s deficit in the 2010-11 year.,Trailing just one vote behind GPP, team JDL has run a well-polished campaign. Each member of JDL is individually suited for his or her position, but they lack the strong group cohesion that both GPP and RMS demonstrated.,Throughout the Journal Editorial Board, both of JDL’s VP candidates seemed dependant on Johnson for validation.,Team JDL’s vice-presidential candidate of university affairs Mira Dineen has extensive knowledge and experience in Kingston. Her work as the AMS’s academic affairs commissioner is a natural stepping stone to the vice-presidential position. But Dineen was frequently taken aback by questions and wasn’t persuasive.,Johnson, JDL’s presidential candidate, offered a mix of benefits and drawbacks. Having been ASUS president and currently representing the Society as student senate caucus chair, Johnson has ample experience interacting with administration.,But Johnson’s claim that he “knows how to speak the language” of administrators is what makes him unapproachable for students.,While their platform has specific metrics of success, problems came in the form of prioritization. When asked to identify the single most important aspect of their platform, JDL selected their library improvement package. It includes increasing library study space and the creation of a mobile app that shows an estimate of how many seats are available in each library.,These ideas seem trivial in light of more pressing issues facing the University. Suspension of a program due to financial troubles is more important than open seats at Stauffer.,This AMS executive race is the first time since 2008 that three teams have run. Having a fully-external team like RMS in the race is refreshing and presidential candidate Jeffrey McCarthy, VP operations candidate, Bryor Snefjella and VP of university affairs candidate Sean Renaud should be commended.,Team RMS received the lowest number of Journal votes at five, but they deserve recognition for their efforts. They did their research.,They’re an honest and humble trio but failed to sell their external perspective as more of a benefit than a detriment. With a year-long term, teams cannot spend the majority of their time becoming familiar with the job.,Renaud proved himself as a contender. As a mature student with multiple college degrees and experience managing a company, he would be an effective VP of university affairs.,VP operations candidate Snefjella was the clear weak link on the team, something he admitted in his interview. His experience with budgets extends only to a $10,000 not-for-profit organization he runs in Kingston, and his lack of practical experience could be a liability for AMS operations.,In the current financial climate of the University, a strong president is needed to stand up to administration in the face of cuts. RMS’s presidential candidate McCarthy was genuine and principled. Unfortunately, he didn’t display a firmness neccessary to contend with administrators.,An endorsement is our opportunity to voice who we think would best serve student interests at the executive level. By a narrow margin, it’s GPP."},{"title":"iEducation too expensive","url":"/story/2012-01-24/editorials/ieducation-too-expensive/","date":"January 24, 2012","content":"On Thursday, Apple Inc. announced a plan to publish textbooks on iPads.

But these perks only come after students make an initial investment of $519 — the retail cost of a no-frills iPad.,It’s a one-time payment that’s too high for many students, even though the savings accrued by purchasing digital textbooks could make it worthwhile over time.,Apple has also released an application for creating digital textbooks, but it’s only available on the Apple operating system. The closed nature of Apple’s programs makes them inaccessible.,To make iPad textbooks more accessible for students and to expand their market share, Apple needs to market a simplified tablet.,A stripped-down iPad specially geared towards textbook functions would serve to make the product more affordable.,Tablets have immense potential to improve textbook learning. Integrating sound, video and animation into a lesson could serve to illustrate points in a creative way, appealing to a wide range of learning styles.,Teaching students about the process of mitosis, for example, would be more effective with an annotated video that shows each distinct step. Textbooks have great content, but are hindered by a simplistic method of delivery.,With information trending towards digitization, textbooks should follow suit. Apple is initiating this new genre of textbook, but the digital textbook world will eventually belong to the company with the best product at the lowest cost.,As it stands, the monopoly held by the three largest textbook companies has shifted slightly into Apple’s hands.

On Jan. 19, AMS Assembly passed a motion in reaction to the uncompleted phases.,Initially, the AMS had promised a capital contribution of $25.5 million from the student body but now will contribute only $10.6 million to Phase 1 alone.,The AMS decision to cancel the mandatory student fee saves each student from funneling $141 per year into a non-existent project. It’s the administration’s turn to be vocal.,Cancelling further construction was a wise decision considering the University’s current financial troubles. Admin is obligated to be transparent with the student body that helped finance the project.,Queen’s hasn’t released a formal a public statement regarding the future of Phases 2 and 3 since claiming they were postponed indefinitely in 2009. A lot of questions have arisen in two years surrounding the Union Street wasteland that was once destined to become a field house and an arena.,They owe it to their investors and students to outline a plan — or at least be honest if there isn’t one.,Walking around campus, it’s obvious that construction was brought to a halt. There’s a vacant lot and a chain-link fence at Union and Division Streets, and the PEC is vacant.,We deserve a comprehensive explanation detailing why Phases 2 and 3 aren’t financially viable. It’s still unclear how Phase 1 of the Queen’s Centre construction came in $41 million over budget. The promise of newly-constructed facilities was used as a lure for prospective students, but now amounts to false advertising.,If the project was mismanaged, there needs to be horizontal accountability for whoever made the errors. With a constantly changing student cohort, administration isn’t accountable to a permanent population that remebers seven-year-old promises. Changes need to be made, whether through parameters of internal accountability, or through the hiring of an external management firm to oversee construction.,Administration needs to have the decency to tell Queen’s students what went wrong. Principal Daniel Woolf needs to make a State of the Union address that tells us clearly about the financial health of the University and where we stand on a number of projects.

We’re known for a diversified economy based on both natural resources and trade.,We’re not a country that ignores social responsibility to pursue short-term economic gain.,Harper is transforming us into a resource-exporting country, a strategy that encourages international dependency and restricts national innovation.,Harper’s economic plan is short-sighted. It leaves us vulnerable to the Dutch disease, a phenomenon termed after Holland exhausted its natural gas reserves in 1959.,The Dutch disease occurs when a country’s reliance on natural resources leads to a decline in its manufacturing sector. When a resource boom leads to higher currency and a higher exchange rate, manufacturers struggle to stay attractive in the world market.,Dutch disease usually sets in after a resource boom ends, but Canada’s geographic size and diversity means we’re already feeling it.,With 95 per cent of our oil concentrated in Alberta and 75 per cent of our manufacturing industry based in Ontario and Quebec, a Western oil boom hurts Eastern manufacturing economies.,Look at the patterns of our top two export products. Between 2001 and 2007, Canada’s crude oil exports increased from $16 billion to $41.8 billion, while revenue from automobile exports declined from $41 billion to $32.6 billion. Although the Canadian dollar improved strongly in this period, employment rates in Quebec and Ontario still dropped by 2.3 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively.,After the recent recession, the Canadian dollar improved, but manufacturing output continued to struggle. From 2009 to 2010, manufacturing employment fell by 2.1 per cent though overall employment grew by 1.4 percent.,The Dutch disease is already here — Harper’s transformative agenda will only perpetuate it.,Canada isn’t set up for a resource-based economy. Since income from natural resources falls primarily into provincial jurisdiction, excessive resource exploitation could permanently damage the cohesion of our federal economy.,A responsible government should instead focus on innovation. Competitive manufacturing industries requiring skilled labour would represent a more sustainable way to tap into emerging world markets.,Otherwise, once that oil boom ends, we’re screwed."},{"title":"Eyes open","url":"/story/2012-01-24/editorials/eyes-open/","date":"January 24, 2012","content":"Recent research from the University of Maryland points to growing numbers of pedestrians injured or killed while wearing headphones.

Over the study period, the rate of accidents per year tripled.,It’s absurd. People wearing headphones need to take responsibility for their survival. It should be simple. Listen to music all you want, but don’t forget about your surroundings. Stumbling in front of a train or a car because you’re too distracted by your iPod shouldn’t happen.,To someone looking out for the public good, these numbers seem like a rising threat to the health and well-being of the populace. If the situation sounds unlikely, think back to 2009, when Ontario legislature unanimously passed a law against “distracted driving.” With legislative approval, texting or making phone calls while driving a car became illegal.,“Anything that can reduce accidents on our roadways is going to be good,” Conservative MPP Christine Elliott told the Toronto Star in April 2009.,The justification for laws against using phones while driving could easily be applied to deaths and injuries related to headphone use while walking. But the reasoning isn’t the same. Walking and wearing headphones doesn’t represent the same threat as driving while distracted.,There are significant flaws in the Injury Prevention study. Factors such as substance abuse or suicidal intentions weren’t considered when accounting for injuries and deaths. Simply aggregating information without looking at context can produce inaccurate results. Further research needs to be done before the results can be called conclusive.,The trend towards greater headphone-related injury and death doesn’t call for legislative intervention. Distraction is a danger at any given time, and it can’t be legislated away.,Headphone wearers need to be more aware of their surroundings and take care around train tracks and intersections.

Manley even went so far as to say that it “isn’t much of a cancer” and if someone has prostate cancer they should simply “deal with it.” The editorial creates a hierarchy of suffering, and makes prostate cancer out to be relatively insignificant. It’s a position that has little ground to stand on. One death can’t be measured as worse than another because of its cause.,Manley’s arguments are so rife with problems that it would be easy to debunk his claims point by point, but an overwhelming number of comments were knee-jerk ad hominem attacks. The merit of Manley’s argument should have been attacked, instead of making him out to be an insufferable asshole and tacking on veiled personal threats.,An informed discussion can’t happen when people let anger overcome logic, and a personal attack simply destroys the validity of the criticism.

The movement towards its reinstatement to remain vocal and active this semester.,AMS’s committee investigating the issue put forth a motion to establish guidelines for the future suspension of programs. While useful for future program suspensions, it does little to challenge the current suspension of Fine Arts.,When the motion was brought to Senate, it was postponed for future consideration. The guidelines for future suspensions and a reconsideration of Fine Arts’ suspension needs to be weighed.,Budget limitations require sacrifices, but a more creative solution needs to be reached. Decisions need to be more transparent, and allow for student consultation — unlike the stark email that was sent to Fine Arts students without warning.,Rather than trying to justify the suspension, the University should work to find an amicable solution. Students need to rally support to secure the future of the Fine Arts program.,It’s time for Queen’s to add a fall reading week to the calendar. Doing so would bring us into line with schools like Ryerson and University of Toronto, which recently added the weeklong break.,The extra time to catch up on work and readings while providing a change of pace could immensely benefit students. Stress levels are high as assignments and readings pile up, and a break to catch up on them would be a big help to students.,Instating a fall reading week would also give graduating students time to prepare applications for graduate programs and jobs.,The idea of introducing a fall reading week was last brought to an AMS plebiscite in 2007, with an entirely different student cohort than today. Students should be given the chance to vote again on implementing the break.,With a winter semester reading week, it makes sense that Queen’s should have one in the fall as well. The change would likely impact the placement of Frosh Week or the winter break, but these are scheduling hurdles that can be overcome.,Implementing a second reading week could have a big payoff for students. If it doesn’t work out, there’s nothing to stop Queen’s from reverting back to the current system.,In response to the tragic student deaths last year, various action groups with similar goals were struck.,Groups including the AMS’s mental health committee, the Principal’s Mental Health Commission and the mental health working group should consider pooling their resources and merging into a larger and more effective body.,With greater resources at their disposal, the groups could provide an efficient and united front capable of significant action.,Working towards the same goal while functioning as different bodies could result in redundencies. A single combined group could reduce time-wasting. With months to discuss and formulate plans, action needs to be taken. It would be useful to increase the number of counselors and staff at Health, Counseling and Disability Services and provide more staff for the Peer Support Centre.,The utility of switching from percentage grades to a Grade Point Average system is questionable, but now that the change has been made, it needs to be better explained.,The 4.3 GPA system that has brought Queen’s in line with other North American universities remains complicated in the minds of students. Little explanation was provided for the change and students are stressed out, wondering what adverse effects it will have on their transcripts.,There are inconsistencies among class instructors, some of whom haven’t switched over to letter grades or have made a partial switch, using both number and letter grades. It’s confusing.,There need to be more resources put in place that will help students and faculty members to get a better grasp of the GPA system this year.,Technology is playing a greater role on campus and in classrooms at Queen’s, but current technological systems have left many disappointed.,Expectations were high for the new multi-million dollar SOLUS database, but the new program has failed to meet student hopes.,It’s not offline for 12 hours a day like its predecessor, QCARD, but a number of flaws in the new system have kept it from being a vast improvement.,Difficulties in finding financial information and a class planner that didn’t provide class times are just two examples of the major frustrations that need to be fixed. SOLUS has proven difficult to use, and would benefit from an extensive in-site tutorial or information Youtube video for first-time users. Staff at the Registrar’s Office aren’t even fully equipped to use the new program.,Another piece of technology at Queen’s that needs improving is Webmail. With email functioning as a primary mode of communication, the 100Mb inbox of Webmail is limiting. Restrictions on singular email sizes are troubling as well.,With the current popularity of smartphones, Webmail should be tweaked to make pairing your inbox with a phone simpler. As it stands now, installing Webmail on a smartphone is like navigating a maze.,Tech glitches have also been rife in the AMS’s online voting system. This year, some alumni were able to vote, while some eligible students weren’t. If problems like these aren’t repaired, the AMS should consider reverting back to a paper ballot system.,Otherwise a shadow is cast on an already low voter turnout. It’s better to have an inefficient system, as long as it ensure a credible democratic process."},{"title":"Hot food has purpose","url":"/story/2011-11-04/editorials/hot-food-has-purpose/","date":"November 4, 2011","content":"Vendors at the Queen’s Farmer’s Market were notified last month that a new policy prohibits the sale of hot food. It’s a decision that has negative consequences on vendors and risks the market’s future prosperity.,In letters sent to vendors, Catering manager John McKegney stated the guiding principles of the Farmer’s Market include supporting local produce — something hot foods fail to do if they use non-local ingredients.,Paulina’s Curry Mix is one of the affected vendors at the market, and owner Vipin Kumar told the Journal his ingredients for hot dishes are purchased from local stores such as Tara Foods on Princess Street.,The ban on hot foods has been stifling to local businesses, with Paulina’s reporting a 40 per cent drop in sales since the policy was put in place. It’s counterintuitive to the market’s support of local businesses.,In a statement to the Journal yesterday, executive director of Housing and Hospitality Services, Bruce Griffiths said that a vendor’s right to sell hot food is being reassessed with new information the vendor has provided.,Other vendors selling cold foods will be reassessed once more information has been gathered as to whether or not there products are local.,Hot dog stand Scottie’s Street Treats has been exempt from the policy and is continuing to sell hot food. Scottie’s uses local ingredients and so has been allowed to remain in operation, according to Griffiths.,The Farmer’s Market is a cherished and valuable part of Queen’s, giving students a chance to interact socially and economically with local vendors. It gives a boost to many small businesses.,The absence of hot food further limits the number of non-Sodexo options on campus.,Reducing potential options is something that’s contrary to student appetites. If vendors prove they respect the spirit and principles of the Farmer’s Market, then they should be allowed to sell any food they choose."},{"title":"Forget division","url":"/story/2011-11-18/editorials/forget-division/","date":"November 18, 2011","content":"The popularity of Quebec’s newest political party confirms that separatism is dead.,On Nov. 14, François Legault launched the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) party, calling for Quebecers to stop defining themselves as either sovereigntists or federalists and instead focus on more relevant provincial issues.,Legault wants to address the education and health care systems, increase wealth creation and, most importantly, protect French language and culture. But he wants to do it by ruling out separatism and ending the division between Quebecers.,It’s a good thing because separatism is the wrong way forward for Quebec. The province needs to preserve and strengthen its cultural and linguistic identity within a federalist framework.,An independent Quebec couldn’t and wouldn’t survive in an increasingly globalized community. And Quebecers know it. Legault’s already the frontrunner to take power in a restless province — the CAQ only became an official party four days ago, but it has led in public opinion polls for months.,The CAQ surfaced at a time when popular support for separatism is lower than ever before. May’s federal election saw the New Democratic Party win 59 of Quebec’s 75 seats and the Bloc Québécois (BQ) lose official party status after winning only four.,The provincial version of the BQ, the Parti Québécois (PQ), is in turmoil and lacks direction after leader Pauline Marois was unable to overcome dissenters within the party. This summer, six provincial legislators left the PQ to sit as independents.,With Premier Jean Charest’s Quebec Liberal Party buried in ongoing corruption allegations, public opinion suggests that Legault could take power in the next provincial election.,He appeals to the province’s desire for change — for more than 40 years, Quebec obsessed over whether it should be a separate country instead of focusing on socioeconomic development, and the province floundered in the process.,The NDP’s success and the CAQ’s popularity are no flukes. Both parties call for Quebec nationalism within a Canadian context — they’ve both connected with voters by advocating the importance of language politics instead of reigniting the tiresome separatism debate.,If Quebecers are serious about wanting realistic progress, it’s no surprise that separatism is dead."},{"title":"Support for Scouts","url":"/story/2012-01-17/editorials/support-scouts/","date":"January 17, 2012","content":"A movement opposing the Girl Scouts of the USA’s policy on transgender children has been gaining momentum. The web-based group, HonestGirlScouts, asks that people show their disapproval of the Girl Scouts for accepting transgender children into their troops.,A video on YouTube shows Taylor, a 14-year-old ex-Girl-Scout who asks people boycott the traditional Girl Scout cookies. The admission of a seven-year-old transgender child into a Colorado troop last October sparked the controversy. On Dec. 14, the Christian Post reported that three Girl Scout troops in Louisiana disbanded due to transgender inclusion.,The Girl Scouts accept anyone who identifies as a girl and don’t require proof of gender. Given that the group’s mandate is one of inclusivity and acceptance it’s appropriate that Girl Scouts treat all girls the same way.,The movement to boycott the sale of cookies promotes discrimination against transgender children. Those in favour of the boycott argue that having transgender children integrated into female troops presents a security threat, but this is alarmist thinking.,It’s a doubtful assumption, likely based in ignorance of what it means to be transgender. To be transgender isn’t to follow a passing whim, but to actualize an identity that can be felt but not immediately seen. To be transgender isn’t to act a certain way, it’s to be a certain way.,The presence of transgender children in a troop could result in discussion about the complexities of gender and identity among families, and greater integration would lead to greater acceptance.,While it’s no one’s right to decide when or how a parent broaches complex subjects with their children, transgender people exist, and that’s the reality.,Asking Girl Scouts to label each member’s gender is problematic. It means that children might be singled out when they hoped to be quietly integrated — something they’re entitled to do.,Girl Scouts is built on the assumption that girls act differently together than they do with boys, and gain from bonding with girls alone. Maybe it’s time to rethink this principle. Girls Scouts should adapt their philosophy to fit a modern world, one where the gender binary is challenged.,The anti-transgender movement aimed at Girl Scouts is on shaky ground and deserves the criticism it has received in popular media.,Girl Scouts has a mission statement to teach girls to “relate to others with increasing understanding, skill and respect,” and admitting transgender children to the group does exactly that."},{"title":"Voting glitches unacceptable","url":"/story/2011-11-04/editorials/voting-glitches-unacceptable/","date":"November 4, 2011","content":"Due to online glitches in the Oct. 25 and 26 AMS elections, some students were left wondering if their votes counted.,Even after casting their ballots,,some students received emails reminding them to vote; other emails told students they weren’t eligible to vote, when in fact they were.,Most concerning, some alumni and transfer students were able to vote in the AMS fall referendum and elections for rector and Arts and Science Undergraduate Society representatives.,This error resulted from inconsistencies in the Registrar’s Office student list which the Commission of Internal Affairs (CIA) used as a voters list.,It’s the AMS’s responsibility to ensure that student representatives are elected fairly, but errors have undermined the democratic process. These mistakes are unacceptable.,According to the Registrar, there were a maximum of 25 discrepancies on the list, so the effect on election results was likely minimal.,AMS commissioner of internal affairs Mark Preston reported that no more than 100 students contacted him with voting issues.,Given the feedback initiative system — whereby students with problems have to contact the CIA directly — it’s uncertain if this is an accurate number.,These system errors do a disservice to the voters and lessen their faith in the process. Students are often touted as an apathetic group and this misstep, where some votes perhaps didn’t count and others shouldn’t have, reduces trust in the system.,The eligibility discrepancies resulted from lack of oversight. The CIA sent the Registrar’s list directly to VoteNet Solutions, the company that operates the voting software.,The Registrar’s Office told the Journal via email that the CIA was informed “This year’s set of data may not be as accurate as it has been in the past, since the review and tidying up of student record anomalies had not yet taken place.,This means the CIA failed to adequately review a voters list even after its accuracy was called into question.,Preston said that because of the size of the voters list, it’s hard to weed out discrepancies and “A lot of it is taking what the Registrar has compiled and accepting it.”,This reasoning is unacceptable. Steps need to be taken to ensure that discrepancies like this don’t happen. Whether or not it’s an arduous task, an accurate voters list is essential for fair elections.,If the AMS doesn’t have a member list on hand, which would presumably function as a voters list, then that’s an issue in itself.,Greater safeguards need to be put in place to keep errors like this from happening again."},{"title":"Occupy not over","url":"/story/2011-12-01/editorials/occupy-not-over/","date":"December 1, 2011","content":"Since it reached Confederation Park on Oct. 15, I’ve continued to frequent Occupy Kingston.,At first, I didn’t understand what the occupation was for, or how my life experience fit into the equation.,After attending the first official occupation and speaking to a variety of attendees, I soon realized that this is a complex movement — it isn’t simply black and white.,According to Trish Hennessy’s Index at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, in 2009 the average income for Canada’s top 100 best-paid CEOs was $6.6 million. This is compared to an average salary of $42,988 for full-time employees.,This is only one statistic that demonstrates the societal gap we face as Canadians. Capitalism assumes everyone can be successful if they choose to be ambitious. But, not everyone is born with equal opportunity.,Class division is the product of a society where a small portion of the population owns the production and distribution of goods. The majority, at different levels of exploitation, sells labour in return for a salary.,Ambition has very little to do with monetary success. There are societal barriers and privileges, embedded in the capitalist structure, that prevent or allow individuals to work their way up the financial hierarchy. Becoming wealthy, or the prospect of it, isn’t a choice. This is something the Occupy movement seeks to demonstrate.,One of the strongest aspects of Occupy is that there’s no hierarchy. Decisions are consensus-based. Having a leader would defy the very essence of the fight.,Occupy isn’t asking for specific enough changes. The movement asks for a paradigm shift in thought that can’t be remedied by a changed law or a new politician. We seem to forget that although this movement has shared feelings about corporations and governments, protesters have individual motives.,There may not be a single answer, but that doesn’t mean the movement hasn’t been successful. It has shown the world that everyday injustices, like inadequate health care and inaccessibility to education, are no longer accepted norms.,Don’t assume occupiers are stereotypes (pothead, homeless et cetera), go to Confederation Park and have a conversation with one of them.,Occupy, as seen from my angle, displays the importance of freedom of expression and democracy.

However after a series of all-nighters and a recent visit to the doctor’s office, I would say sleep is for the enlightened.,There’s a myth that Napoleon Bonaparte and Leonardo da Vinci slept for less than five hours per day. If that’s true, these people were able to accomplish various feats at great risk to their health. They are the exception.,According to a 1997 study done by Stanford University, the average university student should get approximately eight hours of sleep a night. If you ask me, that number should be around six or seven.,It’s not that I’m against sleep, but if it’s a choice between spending extra time on an essay or getting much-needed shuteye, I’m going to pick the former. This type of logic is exactly what leads people to prioritize success over their health.,The unfortunate reality is that people today are busier than in previous generations. Although time management is essential to maintain one’s health and success, people often opt to cut down on sleep to fit everything into their busy schedules.,According to a 2005 StatsCan report, students spend approximately 9.2 hours during the week on school work as well as paid and non-paid work. On average a university student has 20 to 25 hours of class a week with additional time spent on tasks like personal care, commuting, leisure and socializing.,The survey also reports that over 16 per cent of students consider themselves workaholics, 64 per cent forgo sleep to complete other tasks and approximately 39 per cent of students feel that they are under constant pressure to handle more than they are able to.,As someone who is a midnight caffeine-boost enthusiast and does more than the occasional all-nighter, I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed.,These types of pressures often lead to unhealthy lifestyle decisions like frequent caffeine dependency, smoking and binge eating to ward off stress.,While I understand the concern about the long-term effects of caffeine addiction and sleep deprivation, sometimes there just aren’t enough hours in the day to complete daily tasks.,Juggling a full course load, running daily errands, part-time jobs, extracurricular activities and maintaining a social life can be a handful. During busy weeks, activities like going to the gym and getting a proper night’s rest are often neglected. Healthy lifestyle choices can be seen as a chore.,The root of the problem isn’t a lack of understanding. Rather, it’s the competitive nature of today’s society which makes it impractical for individuals to adequately lead healthy lifestyles.,Students, myself included, need to resist this tendency to run themselves ragged.

The administration mismanaged the situation, perpetuating student frustration by issuing vague statements.,While the suspension was set for one year, there’s been no guarantee from the administration that the program will be brought back in its current form. If the intent is to transition into the program’s cancellation, the administration needs to be upfront. With the University’s financial woes, the future of Fine Arts is uncertain.,It’s unfair and inaccurate to say the administration is targeting Fine Arts. More should have been done to seek the program’s preservation.,Donations should have been aggressively pursued to try to keep the program functioning.,Cutting costs is a necessary step when there’s a deficit, but it makes more sense to eliminate costs from the processes of the University rather than the product students pay for.,Student-artists have been unfairly dealt with, especially those in their first year of the Fine Arts program.,Given the highly creative and personal nature of the program, students are an excellent resource to one another, trading tips and techniques. The current class of first years will be short-changed because new students won’t be enrolling, meaning fewer students to share collected wisdom.,AMS assembly struck a committee on Nov. 10 to investigate the suspension of Fine Arts, comprised of ASUS executive, AMS executive and the Queen’s rector.

This would result in an average annual price tag of $3,793 for tuition in 2017. While Quebec would still have the cheapest tuition compared to any other province, students have every right to protest against increases.,After reported violence against the demonstrators on Nov. 10, a group of more than 200 students formed a human chain outside the building.,Clashes with bicycle-mounted police led to the intervention of about 40 riot police who used pepper spray to push students back. Additional police reinforcements arrived soon after, the Daily reported.,There were various reports of the police using excessive violence. Even an associate professor, who stopped to observe the events, reported that he was clubbed in the ribs, knocked over and pepper sprayed as he tried to stand back up.,Those staging the sit-in were threatened with charges and non-academic probation for their protest. After negotiations with administrators, there were no arrests, charges or disciplinary action taken.,The fact that punitive action was even proposed in the first place is utterly ridiculous. Students have the right to protest and shouldn’t have faced threats for voicing dissent.,Introducing riot police into a peaceful protest was an inappropriate decision, and only stood to escalate the situation.,Riot police are a serious and frightening force, and their presence is likely to set a peaceful group on edge. As a step forward, an investigation was launched by McGill’s administration to look at the Nov. 10 protest and ensuing violence.,It needs to determine whether or not the riot police’s use of force, tear gas and pepper spray were at all justified.,While the state has a monopoly of the legitimate use of force, any police intervention needs to be closely monitored.

Bands is prevented from performing for the remainder of the fall term after controversial material, circulated amongst Bands members, was brought to the attention of the University and the AMS.,The Bands songbook features vulgar and sexist songs and issues of the “The Banner” were rife with offensive material. Past front page titles from the past three years of this Bands-published pamphlet include “Mouth raping your little sister since 1905” and “Perpetuating racial stereotypes since 1905.”,Calling something a joke doesn’t make it harmless or acceptable. Rape is a topic that’s never appropriate to joke about; just as making light of racial stereotypes is never okay. Arguing “The Banner” was all in good fun fails to take into account the seriousness of the situation. The suspension of Bands isn’t an example of the politically correct run amok — the recourse taken by the University was justified.,The fact is that Bands is partially funded by a mandatory student fee and the members represent Queen’s across Canada.,Bands has been a proud tradition at Queen’s for more than a century, but this doesn’t make the organization immune to criticism.,We don’t want to be represented by the Bands’ songs and traditions if they are offensive.,This isn’t to say that every Bands member is equally accountable for circulated materials. As a group, Bands is composed of dedicated and talented individuals who shouldn’t be painted as insensitive, sexist or racist. Being in Bands is an immense commitment and requires a large amount of work. While we respect Bands members for their enthusiasm and performances, the apparent subculture is simply not okay.,It’s likely that many individuals in Bands were uncomfortable with the songs they were expected to sing. Their songbook contains a disclaimer that only “lame people don’t sing,” so some people were probably pressured into participating. With a suspension for the remainder of the term and human rights and equity training, hopefully it will be clear to Bands members that the group’s subculture is unacceptable.,The administration’s openness when handling the ban was the right choice. Though the decision garnered national media attention and cast Queen’s in an unfavourable light, it’s preferable to keeping the story under wraps.,The Journal’s decision to publish the songbook and quote from “The Banner” allowed for a more thorough understanding of the decision to ban Bands. The materials provided examples of the “explicit, disrespectful and degrading language” that the administration cited in their decision. The way in which the University delivered its judgment could have been better. It’s too often that administrative decisions carry a parental tone.,Rather than making the human rights training mandatory, administration and the AMS should have made it clear that in order to represent Queen’s University, Bands needs to change. They should have given members the chance to right their wrong independently, without being told what to do.,The Bands executive’s decision to decline comment to the media has left a gap in the story — one that can’t be laid to rest until both sides are told. Until then, speculation will continue. The short statement issued through the Queen’s news centre and AMS website does little to explain the situation from a Bands perspective.,A balanced perspective can’t be provided until they have a chance to explain themselves. Bands needs to openly admit their mistakes and state how they will endeavor to make changes.,Queen’s and the Bands’ reputation has been momentarily tarnished, but both will recover from the bad publicity. The organization will bounce back if they reform their ways.,The imposed measures won’t destroy the group, they will improve it. This suspension provides Bands the chance to emerge stronger and more inclusive. The Bands’ recently publicized indiscretions provide clubs and teams the chance to reconsider the norms and traditions they maintain.,Doubtless there are other groups who wouldn’t want all the jokes they tell, the stories they share or the traditions they follow to end up in national newspapers. Now is the time to reflect on why that is and adhere to the standards that students expect.,It’s important that Bands was given the chance to reconcile their behaviour, and it’s also necessary for them to be banned in the interim.,As long as Bands is affiliated with this sort of behaviour, they shouldn’t be allowed to represent Queen’s.

A student is more likely to cheat if they don’t have an adequate understanding of a subject, and giving them a mark of zero for cheating makes no attempt remedy this.,Knowledge must be favoured over punishment in order to prevent students from facing long-term intellectual inadequacies.,Removing the academic penalties of cheating hasn’t affected the disciplinary consequences. A student caught cheating is still subject to detention or suspension. Cheating has social consequences that are more impactful than academic ones.,Peers will think less of those who are cheaters. It’s embarassing. This policy gives students who cheat the chance to explain their motivations and will lead to a more positive outcome than a ruined transcript.,Cheating because of sickness or personal struggle shouldn’t be treated in the same way as cheating due to laziness.

Work that is a result of serious effort needs to be rewarded above that of someone who cheated on their first try.

Having a week off of class to catch up on assignments and readings would be helpful.,It could be beneficial for student mental health.,While it’s an oversimplification to assume that a break would resolve mental health issues on campus, it could certainly help with student stress levels. Having time to catch up on work and relax would lessen the stress caused by approaching midterms.,A fall reading week would also give upper-year students a chance to be proactive and work on applications for post-graduate studies or employment.,Many graduate programs set application deadlines for early November, and having a reading week beforehand would give students the extra time needed to gather reference letters, write cover letters and update resumes.,The week of class time lost for a fall reading week would have to be allocated from somewhere. Because classes start relatively late in September — this year the semester began on Sept. 12 — the summer might be a good option. It could mean reducing Frosh Week as well.,A shortened summer holiday is a valid concern. Many students work full time during the summer months to help pay for tuition and rent.,A break could result in a loss of earnings, but Queen’s starts comparitively late so it’s still possible for students to work until Labour Day even with an added reading week.,If the question of a fall reading week is brought to the student body, it should carry attendant questions including when students would like to see the time appropriated from.,Whatever the possible pitfalls associated with a fall reading week, it’s a discussion that needs to be re-opened."},{"title":"Eat close to home","url":"/story/2012-01-13/editorials/eat-close-home/","date":"January 13, 2012","content":"If you have a hankering for fresh strawberries or pineapple today, you only have to walk to a nearby grocery store.,In the Ontario climate, strawberries are long out of season and pineapple will never exist in a local orchard.,Generations ago, enjoying a fresh strawberry sundae required patience until the next growing season.

The nature of Halloween allows for characterization. Dressing as a character is acceptable, but portraying an ethnicity or culture isn’t.,Some argue that those who are offended by a Halloween costume need to build a thicker skin, but this point of view is flawed. It isn’t the responsibility of observers to try to ignore the way an offensive costume makes them feel.,The campaign has inherent problems because it’s difficult to draw a hard and fast line around what is offensive. For example, do police officers have the right to be offended on Halloween because their profession is often sexualized in costumes?,The best course of action is for each individual dressing up to stop and think before stepping into a costume.

A 2010 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development report stated that Canada’s obesity rate is 25 per cent, two out of three adult men are overweight and the report predicts the number will continue to rise.,There are limited resources in Canada’s public health-care system. Obesity has links to conditions including diabetes, strokes and certain types of cancer — all of which require expensive treatments.,The province of Ontario spent nearly $45 billion on healthcare in the 2010-11 year out of a total expenditure of $122.9 billion. It’s an extremely high figure and steps need to be taken to reduce it.,Preventative measures are a logical step to foster good health while cutting health-care costs. In the same way that alcohol and cigarettes are subject to excise taxes, so should the purchase of unhealthy foods.,A tax places the onus on the individual to make healthy choices, promoting a sense of urgency.,Unhealthy foods are generally perceived as less expensive and consequently accessible to all, regardless of socio-economic status.,While eating healthily doesn’t need to be expensive, it remains to be seen whether or not those most vulnerable will be hurt by this tax. It’s one possible downside that needs to be combated with education.,Many people are largely ignorant in issues of healthy eating, and a critical eye regarding food and nutrition needs to be engrained into the general public. Denmark plans to reinvest the tax’s revenue into fighting a climbing obesity rate, although plans aren’t fully formed. Measures should include advertisement, a public education campaign and possibly even a subsidy for the cost of natural, healthy foods.,A fat tax is a soft measure that won’t be the solution to rising rates of obesity. The tax doesn’t restrict purchases, but tries to encourage healthier alternatives by making them more financially desirable. Obesity is a complex and multi-faceted issue that requires a dynamic approach and implementing a tax on fatty foods is a worthwhile step in combating the problem."},{"title":"Voter turnout calls for changes","url":"/story/2011-10-14/editorials/voter-turnout-calls-changes/","date":"October 14, 2011","content":"Ontario’s Oct. 6 election yielded a voter turnout of 49.2 per cent. It’s the lowest turnout in recorded history. These results are a disappointing drop from the 52.8 per cent turnout seen in the 2007 provincial election. It points to issues in the electoral system.,Canada’s first-past-the-post system is problematic and lends itself to the popular belief that some votes are wasted. The popular vote isn’t accurately reflected in the allotment of seats at Queen’s Park.,Premier Dalton McGuinty’s government won with only 37 per cent of the popular vote and the support of only 18 per cent of Ontario’s eligible voters. Kingston and the Islands MPP John Gerretsen won with 48.8 per cent of the popular vote.,In an attempt to appeal to the broadest number of voters, parties try to govern from the centre, causing the major parties to campaign with similar policies. It’s difficult to differentiate between ideologies.,With no particular swing issue this election, there wasn’t much to inspire voters to get to polls. An alternative electoral system should be reconsidered. Mixed-member Proportional representation allocates seats based on the party’s share of the popular vote. It would allow parties that receive few votes per riding to nonetheless receive a seat in legislature.,Fringe parties would have a say in policy-making, and a threshold requiring a certain percentage of votes to receive a seat prevents an excess of parties in legislature.,If voters felt better represented by their electoral system, they’d be more likely to participate in the process.,The referendum to change Ontario’s electoral system to a Mixed Member Proportional system in 2007 failed to pass with 63.15 per cent against the change. This year’s voter turnout urges a revisiting.,Voting is a right as well as a privilege, but the process should be made as easy as possible. The three days of advanced polls on campus was a commendable initiative from the AMS. While the polls were valuable, they were too early — even before the televised leaders debate.,Put a voting booth on campus. Student voter apathy is a major issue. It’s worth reorganizing city polls to include a Queen’s station on election day. The Student Ghetto is a densely-populated area, where most occupants don’t have access to personal vehicles. This makes getting to off-campus polling stations difficult.,Implementing online voting should also be considered. It would eliminate the “too busy” excuse.

An Oct. 19 article from the Calgary Herald reported on the apparent trend that has been dubbed “drunkorexia.” According to the study, the behavior stems from a desire to save money and get drunk quickly without gaining weight. Labeling the behaviour as an “eating and drinking disorder” does a disservice to those suffering from legitimate disorders that are all too common. Naming the supposed phenomenon “drunkorexia” insinuates the behavior has a direct relation to anorexia nervosa, but this is unproven. Anorexia is a serious and complex eating disorder.,While drunkorexics employ a similar cost-benefit analysis to calories, these are two separate issues. Painting all disorders with the same brush ignores the fact that drunkorexia, as it’s explained in the study, is a simple choice.,Binge drinking is an unhealthy habit that can lead to serious problems. It’s a problem worthy of consideration, but students acting in a foolish and irresponsible manner doesn’t necessarily constitute an emotional disorder.,Those who choose to get drunk by limiting their caloric intake are aware of the risks involved and do so anyway. The student body is a rational group of individuals who at times make poor choices, but it’s sensationalist to claim drunkorexia is a trend on the rise. The Herald article makes mention of Queen’s when stating that alcohol-related health risks are increasing. It cites the 2010 deaths of two Queen’s students, and the resulting coroner’s report that recommended a review of alcohol policies on campus.,This tacit link is utterly inappropriate — there has been no proven connection at all between last year’s tragedies and the apparent trend of drunkorexia.,It’s a sensationalist comparison that has no grounding, and is yet another example of media’s attempt to diagnose problems among the student population without evidence. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed.,It’s hardly logical to compare the results of a study performed at a university in the American mid-west with Queen’s and assume the implications of the study are the same.

They are prone to malfunction and are slow to process information or connect to the server. Scanners also cause large lineups at the door of events, increasing the chance that students will simply attempt to avoid them.,The implementation of these ID card scanners is another example of technology-induced tension between personal freedoms and regulation.

Yet his vast animal collection was allowed to remain in his ownership and on his property.,Regulations surrounding dangerous pets need to be strict, in order to make owners’ responsibilities clear and ensure that pets are appropriately cared for. Large animals require an immense amount of commitment. It’s unlikely that Thompson, who kept the animals in chain-link cages, was providing the necessary care.,In Thompson’s case, local authorities were legally bound from removing animals from his property. There needs to be an arm of animal services that can effectively remove dangerous animals from an owner’s custody. More needs to be done to prosecute people guilty of animal abuse and consequences must be apparent.,After the animals were set loose, local police worked with employees of the Columbus Zoo to try to capture the animals. Despite their efforts, 46 of the animals were shot and killed.,While tranquilization would have been preferable, killing was the right choice given that those attempting to control the situation were at great personal risk. Businessweek reported that one of the zoo’s veterinarians attempted to sedate a tiger but it began charging, forcing police to shoot.,What’s especially troubling is that the collection’s 18 tigers were Bengals, an endangered species. There’s no utility in keeping endangered species as pets, and it’s a practice that should be expressly illegal. Zoos are better equipped to provide care for an endangered animal than a singular owner.,The ownership of exotic animals needs to be highly regulated, but with special attention paid to whether or not an animal is potentially dangerous. A bear may not be as exotic as a peacock, but there’s no question that they’re more threatening.,It’s the animals who suffered most in this situation.

Bark was told a mechanical lift would be installed, and even tested the device this spring, but the project has been delayed indefinitely.,The University’s failure to provide an accessible entrance to the CFRC offices is shameful and should be remedied immediately.,Freedom from discrimination on the ground of disability is guaranteed in the Ontario Human Rights Code.

He shouldn’t have blatantly ignored his instructor’s wishes.,Constant in-class questions and comments are the concern. Lectures aren’t meant to be one-on-one interactions and it’s up to the instructor whether or not to diverge from a lesson to take questions.,There’s an etiquette in lectures that is often disrespected at Queen’s as well.,It’s not fair to forbid a student from speaking at all, and the professor could have set a standard limit on how much each student is allowed to speak.,Snyder’s actions shouldn’t be seen as discrimination against a student because of a stutter.

Applicants with Anglophone names were 39 per cent more likely to be interviewed in Montreal and 20 per cent more likely in Vancouver.,Results showed that even when applications stated Canadian education and experience as well as a stated proficiency in English and French, employers were more likely to select an Anglophone name. University of Toronto researcher Philip Oreopoulos led the study and said it’s likely a selection going on at the subconscious level.,Statistics from the Toronto Immigrant Employment Data Initiative corroborate the research, reported the Globe. The unemployment rate as of September is 5.4 per cent for Canadian-born workers, 8.3 per cent for all immigrants and 13.4 per cent for recent immigrants who have been in Canada for fewer than five years.,Recent immigrants also earn 49 per cent less than native-born workers, even though immigrants typically have higher rates of education. It’s only natural that human beings seek the familiar, but when potential employees are being discriminated against because of their name, something needs to change.,To counteract this bias, employers should designate applications with a number and base the decision of whether or not to grant an interview on skills and experience alone.,Though the bias doesn’t appear to be malicious, this countermeasure will help to ensure that no one is treated unfairly.,Language and communication skills can’t be extrapolated from someone’s name alone, especially in a country as diverse as Canada.,Language skills need to be measured firsthand, not assumed because of their name.,As diversity continues to increase, this bias will likely diminish as all cultures reach a level of familiarity, but this process could take generations. Until that happens, employers need to be more mindful of their tendencies and work to avoid discrimination."},{"title":"Free to friend profs","url":"/story/2011-10-21/editorials/free-friend-profs/","date":"October 21, 2011","content":"Given the ubiquity of social media, it’s only a matter of time before students start to friend, follow or otherwise subscribe to their professors.,An Oct. 18 Maclean’s article outlines prescriptions for student-instructor relationships online. Though there aren’t official rules in place, social media users need to be conscious of online etiquette. Friending a professor on Facebook isn’t the same as following a Twitter feed. Facebook has a more intimate slant than Twitter and both differ from the professional networking site LinkedIn.,Before a student befriends an instructor online, it needs to be clear just what information is being shared. Privacy settings should be adjusted according to the expectations associated with a social networking site.,But, it’s exceedingly difficult to build personal relationships with instructors. With class sizes expanding every year, social media could prove effective in linking students with teachers.,Queen’s professors Sidney Eve Matrix and Jonathan Rose have Twitter accounts with thousands of followers and Principal Daniel Woolf tweets frequently about university issues to a following of over 2,700 people.,In these cases, social media is shown to be a useful tool for disseminating information and opinions. Sharing a link or article with an instructor can lead to an enlightening discussion for both student and teacher.,Placing restrictions on how students interact with faculty members places the relationship into an undue hierarchy.,Most students are legally adults and should be treated as such. Professors shouldn’t be treated as moral role models who need to shield their personal lives.,This is particularly true of teaching fellows who are often just a few years older than their students. Presuming they shouldn’t interact with students on a personal level is disrespectful.,Concerns that knowing details of a student’s personal life will affect an instructor’s grading have little grounding. Instructors should be trusted to withold opinions of someone’s personality when assessing essays or exams.,You have to opt into social media.

It was a bid to capitalize on socially conservative values by being deliberately misleading.,Attack ads are an unfortunate reality of political campaigns and the Conservatives aren’t the only party guilty of exaggerating an issue to call into question the character of a politician.,Earlier in the provincial election, the Liberals ran a TV ad aimed at Hudak. A narrator read, “Hudak treats us like dolts ... like chumps. His plan is a scam. Financial fiction,” as various shots of Hudak’s face drifted in and out of focus. The Liberals also attacked NDP leader Andrea Horwath, referring to her as the “new Mike Harris.” What’s particularly unfair about the flyer circulated by Shenouda is that it isn’t targeted solely at political figures. It catches the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) community in its crossfire.,The flyer takes aim at those who aren’t heterosexual or normatively gendered and implies that they represent deviant behaviour.,It seems the flyer was the result of a cost-benefit analysis that determined the LGBTQ community was smaller than those with socially conservative values, and therefore insignificant to the PC Party.,Because the vehicle of delivery was too offensive, any issues raised by the flyer are overshadowed. It’s unfortunate that sensationalism was prized over substance and that a community was caught in the middle."},{"title":"GPA goes wrong","url":"/story/2011-10-14/editorials/gpa-goes-wrong/","date":"October 14, 2011","content":"The University’s new grading system offers no comfort to Queen’s students. The Grade Point Average, implemented in May, hurts the student who cares about the one per cent difference that can make or break a post-secondary career.,A grade between 77 and 79 per cent is equivalent to a 3.3 GPA, while an 80 per cent at one per cent higher marks the new bracket of a 3.7.,Though it might be theoretically useful, in reality the system discredits hard work and impacts student mentality and work ethic.,Any student who has ever put sleepless nights into an assignment knows that a 77 and 79 per cent aren’t equivalent and shouldn’t be treated as such.,This system completely undermines and devalues student work and achievement. It assumes that two students who receive different grades are deserving of the same GPA label. It maginifies the difference between a 79 per cent and an 80 by placing them in different brackets.,I also have to question what added strain this will have on scholarship recipients.,First-year students with renewable entrance scholarships are given some leniency and are permitted to have a 3.3 GPA rather than the expected 3.7 — which would correspond to the 80 per cent average previously required.,However, nothing on the Renewable Awards Policies outline speaks to upper years with renewable scholarships and the struggles they’ll now face in their attempt to remain in the required GPA bracket.,Concurrent Education students have it rough. A mandatory class they endure is marked on a pass or fail basis. With our old marking system, the effect wasn’t too dramatic.,However, with the new GPA system, a pass means little reward in comparison to the significant drop they’ll face if they receive a fail. It means adding a 0.0 grade point to the average.,Interestingly enough, if passes were made before the new system was put in place, they aren’t counted in a student’s GPA.

Just as people are free to express their religious views, you are free to express yourself accordingly as well.,For instance, as an atheist, if I received a Bible on Halloween, I would be neither offended nor appreciative; I would probably just use it as a decorative bookend.,So although freedom of speech and religion is alive and kicking, let’s leave Jesus out of it for a night and hand out some good old Tootsie Pops."},{"title":"Seven billion miracles","url":"/story/2011-10-18/editorials/seven-billion-miracles/","date":"October 18, 2011","content":"The United Nations has reported that the Earth’s population will reach seven billion by the end of this month.,There are two differing opinions about this population increase.

True, class time differs between faculties, but it’s wrong to assume that one program requires more work than another. No one should dismiss the difficulty of another student’s degree.,If all you have to talk about is your homework, then this points to a bigger problem. Some students forget that school isn’t everything. We’re here for classes, but we have to understand that the world doesn’t stop because of an important midterm. We should also be aware that people often don’t like to hear about things that don’t pertain to them at all.,It’s understandable that we become frenzied over our schoolwork, but too often we let it get in the way of our relationships, health and happiness.,Though this is a unique time in life to focus on ourselves and our own education, it’s also a time to learn about time management, social skills and how to balance it all. We’ll miss these opportunities if our focus is too narrow. Academics are an important part of life but not the only part.

For the first few days, my disinterest in drinking didn’t matter.,But as the week continued, my FRECs realized that their star-struck frosh group would never complain about being uncomfortable.

In these respects, TCT High School represents many private schools.,Selling grades contributes to grade inflation and impacts the make-up of the university applicant pool.,If some students pay for marks, teachers at other schools will raise grades to ensure they remain competitive.

When first-year Harvard students arrived at their residence buildings in September their residence supervisors invited them to sign the pledge.,It centres on the belief that the “exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment.” The Harvard Crimson reported on Sept. 1 that the pledge wasn’t motivated by a specific incident, but by worries that students aren’t “thoughtful or considerate in their actions with their peers.”,A plan to display the pledges by the front doors of each residence building was discarded when it was decided that posting pledges would shame those who didn’t sign their name.,In all, the pledge is an informal promise. Breaking the pledge carries no consequences and there are no punitive measures in place to discipline those who break their promises. It’s a superficial solution that won’t have any real effect.,Behaviour is learned and developed over years. Asking students to promise to act a certain way isn’t likely to change their personalities. The pledge is a silly idea that patronizes students, assuming incivility.,The pledge is an attempt by the administration to control students’ personal behaviour — a concerning concept. A university administration’s demands should be limited to students’ academic conduct. It’s simply not the responsibility of the institution to control the thoughts and habits of students.,Pledges should be taken seriously, just as when doctors take the Hippocratic Oath or when police officers pledge to serve and protect.

The event drew significantly fewer people than last year, which boasted between 1,500 and 2,500 people on the Student Ghetto street.,It’s a sign that the Aberdeen Street party is on its way out.,Without a home football game in late September, the traditional Fauxcoming party had no focal point to revolve around.,Revelers chose to assemble following last weekend’s football game — the last home game until Oct. 15. But having no obvious date for the party meant that it happened on a smaller scale.,Given the absence of a set date, there’s a possibility that residual street parties might occur, but last weekend’s poor showing suggests that no Aberdeen Street party this year will reach a serious size. With the last sanctioned Homecoming in 2008, few students can say they were present for a legitimate Homecoming. The tradition is fading from collective memory as fewer students remember the event each year.,If the trend continues, this could be the last year when students look for an Aberdeen Street party.,Damages and costs associated with the street party have been one of the biggest obstacles blocking the return of a University-sanctioned Homecoming. Its absence bodes well for the event’s future.,The cost of last year’s Fauxcoming was estimated at around $375,000 with Queen’s cutting a cheque to the city. Because the police presence on Sept. 17 was small, the accompanying cost was as well.,Kingston Police are to be applauded for their demeanor on Saturday. Officers were amicable and helpful, and didn’t antagonize the few revelers present. This meant little tension between people on the street and the police.,Choosing to employ officers in unmarked cars was another prudent choice that helped to keep Aberdeen Street quiet.,In previous years, officers marched down the blocked-off street, clad in riot gear, while mounted units trotted around the Ghetto. This resulted in more traffic, eager to see the spectacle and more confrontations between students and police.,Fauxcoming 2011 came and went without much of a sound, hopefully indicating the swan song of the infamous and destructive street party that has for so long put a strain on Town-Gown relations."},{"title":"Other guys","url":"/story/2011-09-30/editorials/be-guy/","date":"September 30, 2011","content":"The Take Back the Night march on Sept. 22 featured the “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign, with signs that read “Just because she’s drunk doesn’t mean she wants to f**k.” The new campaign switched the focus from victims of sexual assault to perpetrators.

The 2009/10 school year had an increase of 1,367 undergraduate students compared to the year before. With a shortage of staff and resources, alternative methods of teaching need to be considered. The University needs to adapt to enormous class sizes that are more common each year.,Excessively large classes disengage students from their learning and makes participation difficult. Students feel like part of a crowd, which makes it challenging to express ideas. Hundreds of students together stifles conversation and makes a fluid discussion almost impossible.,Using technology to improve the problem is a logical step, but online courses as they currently stand aren’t the solution.,Having a professor who is intelligent, educated and available is an important resource that can’t be replaced. The immediacy of a face-to-face interaction is preferable to email interface. With lecture time decreased in blended learning courses, time spent interacting with professors is sacrificed.,Online courses also require self-discipline and independent study skills — qualities that are cultivated through years of study.,It will be harder for first-year students to succeed in blended and online classes compared to an upper-year student who has experience with assignments and exams.

Provincial election. John Gerretsen had eight votes from the editorial board.,This compares to one vote for Green Party candidate Robert Kiley and zero for Rodger James, candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party. There was one abstention.,Holland’s relative inexperience isn’t an insurmountable weakness, and she deserves the chance to prove herself at Queen’s Park. She shows a genuine concern for the riding and would be highly receptive to the concerns of her constituents. One major student issue in this election is how to effectively combat rising tuition rates. The NDP plan for a tuition freeze is the best proposal brought forward.,It’s a plan that would prevent annual increases from crippling students who budget carefully for their education. Accessibility should be the focus of education policy — something that has been recognized by the NDP platform.,Holland spoke to the problems of students graduating with severe debt, and argued that the freeze is superior to the Liberal plan of a tuition reduction. Liberals want to cut tuition by 30 per cent, or an average of $1,600 per university student.,If tuition continues to rise each year, the benefits of the Liberal plan will eventually be swallowed by cost increases. The $1,600 grant only applies to undergraduates, ignoring graduate students. Students who come from families with an income of over $160,000 a year would also be exempt. This is troubling considering the fact that not all families help to subsidize the cost of a university education.,Though Holland’s platform offers the best option for students, one of its flaws is an elimination of privately-funded research. It’s both unrealistic and unnecessary for research to be solely publically funded.,University departments are fully capable of keeping their corporate sponsors at arm’s length while conducting accurate studies.,Platforms are fickle, and it’s not likely for politicians to follow through on everything they promise. For that reason, it’s important to have someone who’s familiar with the riding’s issues and is ready to tackle the challenges that will undoubtedly arise. Gerretsen has proven his ability after serving Kingston and the Islands as MPP for 16 years. He’s aware of the special relationship between Queen’s University and Kingston, and has familial and personal ties to the University.,He said it’s important that Queen’s expand its teaching space and mentioned his role in recent town-gown achievements including the new medical building and the development of the J.K. Tett Centre.,When questioned on the issue of international student funding, Gerretsen avoided any political language and gave a sharp answer on the subject. He said it’s imperative that students be exposed to a diverse array of people and is starkly against the Progressive Conservative plan to reduce funding for international students.,The charismatic Robert Kiley of the Green Party has an intimate knowledge of the problems facing Queen’s students, but policy points failed to stand out in comparison to Holland and Gerretsen.,Kiley said that the Green Party has run of the mill platform points with regards to everything but energy. He was right. He should be commended for his sincerity.,PC candidate Roger James showed a fundamental lack of knowledge in regards to the issues facing Queen’s and Kingston. He spoke of his long and successful career as a businessman, but refused to field questions that covered areas not mentioned in the Conservative platform.,Refusing to deviate from the PC Changebook, he kept quiet on all questions regarding rising tuition costs. James also made international student funding an unduly large issue, and said Conservatives want to cultivate current students rather than draw more to Canada.,Given the PC Party’s neglectful stance on student issues under Tim Hudak, a Conservative government would be the least desirable outcome in the provincial election.,None of the four candidates could name the current AMS President and all but James could name the Queen’s principal. For candidates claiming a desire to engage with Queen’s students, this was disappointing.,While no candidate was without faults, the NDP’s Mary Rita Holland is best suited for the position of Kingston and the Islands MPP.,The Journal’s editorial board interviewed the four candidates running to represent Kingston and the Islands on Oct. 2.

The MAC’s proposed changes should have come before the rebranding.,Ghetto is a word steeped in a dark history, with ties to Jewish segregation in Renaissance Italy and the Second World War. It’s also used in North America to refer to impoverished urban areas.,Our nomenclature is inappropriate. The Student Ghetto isn’t comparable to historical ghettos, but the term’s common acceptance at Queen’s will prevent the renaming from taking root.,The AMS hasn’t explained to the student body why University District is a preferable name and has instead tried to institute a new vernacular without communicating with students.,The first step in the renaming process shouldn’t be rebranding. Instead, the AMS should start by improving housing standards in the area. The student body will be more willing to see the Student Ghetto as the University District if change occurs beneath the surface.,This isn’t the first time the AMS has tried to rename the Student Ghetto. In 2007, the Student Ghetto area was officially renamed the student village, but this failed to enter popular vocabulary. This name change was superficial, and didn’t have any supporting policy.,The term Student Ghetto has stuck because of the nature of housing in the area. Houses are rundown, unclean and many landlords treat students unfairly.,Rebranding the region requires a multi-faceted change. Landlords need to treat students like first-time homeowners and less like destructive transients.,Students also need to rise to the occasion. Any attempts to rebrand the Student Ghetto will hinge on student support. Otherwise, the area will remain unchanged.,Changing the Student Ghetto’s name is the recycling of an old idea that didn’t work.

With no alternative options available for their operations, the groups should be allowed to stay.,Last year’s AMS executive enacted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at the end of their term in April 2011, identifying the Grey House groups’ unique place on campus. Sticking to official policy, the current members of the AMS’s Space Allocation Committee have directly contradicted this.,The situation speaks to an inherent problem of the single-year turnover of many AMS positions and the need to build upon the work of years prior. Policy needs to be applied with a soft hand, especially when guarantees have been made by former AMS executive members.,The Space Allocation Committee has suggested that EQuIP, which is an AMS committee and therefore ineligible for Grey House space, be moved. One possibility is the Social Issues Commission office but this fails to provide the atmosphere that the Grey House is known for.,Because the three Grey House groups often work so closely together, it stands to reason that they should maintain their proximity to one another.,It’s not solely the AMS’s fault.,Levana and OPIRG were informed of the need to re-ratify as AMS clubs in order to maintain their space but the groups have yet to comply. The AMS even pushed back the deadline for re-ratification.,These groups don’t necessarily want to associate themselves with the AMS, but if they want to keep their spaces in the Grey House, this will have to change. When a simple re-ratification will solve the issue, the wise choice would be to keep the space for now and work to change the policy in the future.,After decades in the Grey House, there seems to be a sense of entitlement to the space, despite the fact that the AMS, the Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS) and the University jointly own it.,That said, the lack of AMS consultation with the SGPS on the impending evictions is problematic. The space is not for the AMS to run alone.,The Grey House is an invaluable resource for those who feel marginalized on campus and in the community, so it needs to be preserved. Both sides need to negotiate and do what’s best for students.

Gosselin turned this once lovable show about the chaos of raising twins and sextuplets into a 30-minute whine about her struggles as a single mother.,Quite frankly, the show needed to end because Gosselin doesn’t deserve the public’s attention or concern. She isn’t your average single mother and media attention on her is only serving to skew the hardships of real working moms.,The cover of People this week was a reminder that Gosselin hasn’t left the public eye quite yet. The headline read, “Kate’s Uncertain Future: Will Her Kids Be Okay.” In the article, Gosselin moans, “that she’s freaking out. Big time.” My gut reaction to this was one of confusion — are we supposed to feel badly for Gosselin?,I understand that it can be scary facing the world without a job as a single mother. But Gosselin is far from the norm. She’s been made wealthy by her television show and the intense media attention that’s sprung from it.,If Gosselin was like most single mothers, she would have been saving every penny she could to get through the inevitable rough times. She has faced rough times before when the sextuplets were born and her then-husband lost his job. Past struggles should have taught her to save.,But, she hasn’t been saving. She gets hair extensions that likely cost thousands of dollars. Her show gave her endless freebies, including a trip to Australia and New Zealand earlier this year.,To me, this doesn’t sound like a struggling single mom who deserves our sympathy.,She admits to People that she’s determined to continue to give her children the lavish lifestyle they’ve become accustomed to, including a $1 million mansion and private schools.,Yet they spend time at their father’s bachelor apartment, which he affords off a construction worker’s paycheque.

How could TLC expect her to go back to nursing after being a star?

A University-sanctioned Homecoming is suspended until 2014 when the decision will be up for review.,As a plea for students to stay away from Aberdeen Street, the video is a welcome change from previous attempts to control the party from behind a desk. Traditional AMS methods like mailing letters, tacking up flyers and sending emails have been unsuccessful.,Alumni in the video put a face on the issue and appeal to party-goers in the long term. Current students will be alumni eventually, and if they want the privilege of a fall Homecoming themselves, it’s in their interest to keep Aberdeen Street empty.,For Queen’s students, the importance of Homecoming is the connection with alumni. With nearly an entire undergraduate class who’ve never experienced an official Homecoming, the Aberdeen Street party has become an insufficient replacement.,There’s no place for the raucous Aberdeen Street party in the future of Queen’s Homecoming. The MAC’s video draws attention to this fact.,Let Our Alumni Come Home is too strong in its attempts at emotional appeal. The triumphant music is overdone.,The video fails to target out-of-town students who are known to descend onto Aberdeen Street each fall. It will have little bearing for this group, but the average undecided student may be deterred from inviting their friends from other cities.,The Aberdeen street party should be avoided because it’s a dangerous event that puts an immense burden on the community.

We eat, sleep, chug coffee and study. If we’re lucky, we get to go out and have a social life that doesn’t consist of late nights at Stauffer. It may not seem like an exciting life but it’s certainly a stressful one. Coming out of high school, we all suffer from little fish, big pond syndrome, for which there’s no cure.,There are a few key things that could improve our lives as students. First, an hour each day for a mandatory nap period would be helpful. Regardless of how cleverly you plot your schedule, sleep at night is rare.,To stay healthy, Queen’s should make sure that students get that extra hour of sleep. It could make all the difference. A nap a day keeps the crankiness away.,And while we sit in our three-hour lectures trying to stay awake, a Tim Horton’s concession in the corner of each classroom would ensure that students get a necessary caffeine boost. The ARC isn’t close enough. This would keep us awake and make us attentive pupils.,When students get stressed out, eating properly is the second thing that goes down the tubes — the first being lack of sleep.,Breakfast becomes an optional meal that’s replaced with a granola bar on the go. We’re struggling students, we don’t have the funds or the time to keep ourselves properly nourished. Home-cooked meals on wheels would be a worthwhile investment.,It’s the perfect way to make sure that students don’t get home-sick and allows us to maintain a healthy diet.,Last, students need support and friendship more than anything else. The solution is free hugs. It may seem juvenile but hugs work like a cure-all for everything that ails you. Even if students are hungry, sleep-deprived and fighting to stay caffeinated, they can go for a hug and feel instantly better.,So Queen’s, here are the demands of students.

It’s not a parasitic insect, but a pop song, stuck deep in my head. The affliction is common in our society where we’re constantly inundated by repetitive music, but I’m so often struck that I can only describe it as torment.,Once I have a catchy riff playing in my head, I can rarely do anything else. Chores and tasks are ultimately ignored.,It took 15 years for me to realize that the catchy melody included as a demo track for my old Yamaha synthesizer was actually an instrumental remix of the Rick Astley song “Together Forever.”,While it’s impossible to prevent the occasional earworm, I’ve found that there are steps you can take steps to lessen the suffering.,Theoretically, the best way to avoid getting an earworm is to live as a hermit on a remote mountain.,This is an unrealistic option for most. You can also devote your life to the avoidance of new music, but even just walking down the street exposes you to a potential drive-by shooting of songs blaring from a random car.,None of these preventive measures will help you once you get an earworm. The only true cure for earworms is to track down the whole song and listen to it repeatedly until it’s memorized in its entirety, as opposed to knowing only the catchy section that tends to loop indefinitely.,Once you can remember the whole song, whenever the earworm reoccurs, the song actually ends. Because the worst earworms are the songs you can’t identify, the severity of the earworm is dependent on the media.,Radio stations are such bad offenders that they should be considered a public health hazard. Unlike the TV, which displays the name of the artist and the song in its music videos, the radio just assumes knowledge of songs.,If you don’t have the ability to sing your earworm out loud — so that those around you can identify the song — then there is basically no way to track the song down. You’re left stranded in a sea of crazy.,There is however still hope for closure. Like me, you might be able to find out the name of the song years after it has ravaged your sanity.

Prices for baked goods were set at: $2 for Caucasians, $1.50 for Asians, $1 for Latinos, $0.75 for African Americans and $0.25 for Native Americans. Women received a discount of $0.25.,The bake sale, organized by the Berkeley College Republicans, is meant to protest Senate Bill 185. The bill was passed and presented to Governor Jerry Brown on Sept. 9 who must sign or veto the bill before Oct. 9. If enacted, the bill would allow universities to consider race, ethnicity, gender and national origin on admissions applications.,While it’s a bold and shocking tactic, the Berkeley College Republicans have succeeded in garnering attention. What’s debatable is whether they’ve opened a discussion on the bill or simply drawn flak in the attempt to satirize it.,The sale could prove to be self-defeating, with people discussing the contentious bake sale instead of the senate bill. The racially divisive bake sale is an interesting initiative, but rational discussion doesn’t flourish while people are angry.,It’s a satirical gesture, but one that is deeply offensive for many people.,The bake sale places the identity of patrons into categories — something that is potentially hurtful to individuals. What are patrons charged if they don’t identify their race or gender in the same way that the vendor does?,The fact that the Berkeley College Republicans hosted the sale is problematic. They represent a group associated with a long history of marginalizing minority groups. It’s difficult to examine their actions without also taking into account their ideology. Had the event been put on by a group like Human Rights Watch, it likely wouldn’t have received so much criticism.,Essentially, the bake sale has made the UC Berkeley an unequal and unsafe place in the name of a political statement. It’s an exploitation of the hardship and discrimination that marginalized groups have historically faced.,The bake sale is an oversimplification of a serious issue.,The Berkeley College Republicans should’ve made a greater effort to have their demonstration more accurately represent the debate over admissions criteria. For example, if visible minorities were allowed to skip the line, it would correlate clearly to being given admissions priority.,Because it draws attention to Senate Bill 185, the bake sale is an important demonstration, but its discriminatory nature nearly oversteps the line between satire and insult."},{"title":"Funding for staying home","url":"/story/2011-05-31/editorials/funding-staying-home/","date":"May 31, 2011","content":"Paypal founder Peter Thiel is offering financial incentives to high school students under 20 to avoid post-secondary education and go the route of the entrepreneur. Thiel pledged $100,000 over a period of two years as a “scholarship” to 24 carefully selected high school students so they can start businesses or fund research.,With undergraduate degrees becoming more commonplace, this fund seems like an excellent way to challenge the conventional path. Attending a post-secondary school is stressful, a heavy commitment and the cost may result in years of debt. Receiving funds to work straight out of high school makes it hardly worth it to tough out the four years it takes to earn a standard degree.,This is not to say that a university degree is devoid of worth. An undergraduate education can be rewarding, but for many it’s an unrealistic luxury. Thiel’s scholarships provide an opportunity to some who may not be lucky enough to have multiple educational options.,Conventional education also has the potential to discourage true creativity, forcing students to think inside the box. Markets value innovation and becoming more educated can hinder imagination.,A degree is currently a must-have for many jobs, but as markets change, this isn’t always the case.,Employers may prefer a worker with initiative and independence rather than simply checking their pedagogical credentials.,An unfortunate side effect of the scholarships is that instead of drawing attention to the flaws of our current education system—one that has been criticized for being antiquated and inadequate—it chooses to abandon it altogether.,Furthermore, the business world is a risky place, and having an innovative idea is not enough to guarantee success. Dreams and fortunes are wagered and gambled, with only a slight margin for success. In university, the consequences of a misstep are much lighter, and a poor performance is an expected part of the learning process. Ultimately the choice is personal and neither the decision to pursue post-secondary education or to enter the work force is decidedly right or wrong. University teaches various skills, perhaps most pertinently the skills of critical analysis and communication—two faculties which are of particular help in the business world.,It’s unlikely having a degree will hinder an individual’s success in business but the costs and benefits of schooling should be carefully weighed. The Thiel scholarships are a testament to the fact that people can be successful without being scholars."},{"title":"ASUS also faces red light","url":"/story/2011-03-25/editorials/asus-also-faces-red-light/","date":"March 25, 2011","content":"On March 16, the Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) overturned an existing opt-outable Development fee of $8.57, which it has been collecting for the past three years.,The fee was overturned at the ASUS Annual General Meeting, which gave all Arts and Science students in attendance the freedom to vote on its future.,Over the past three years, the fee payments accumulated to slightly more than $180,000. ASUS spent approximately $40,000 of the accumulated funds renovating the Red Room, a space donated to ASUS five years ago by then-dean of Arts and Science Bob Silverman.,Incoming ASUS president Rico Garcia put forth several suggestions prior to the start of the meeting, including the construction of an “Alpine Tower”—a rope course proposed for West Campus to be used for team building exercises both within the Queen’s community and at large.,A number of objections were raised concerning the feasibility and value of such a construction, and rightly so. The substantial cost associated with building and operating the rope course makes it an idea not worth pursuing.,ASUS should consider directing the surplus funds to a project that has a more immediate and tangible benefit to the Queen’s community.,It’s important to recognize that ASUS executive teams—like many other top student positions—have only one year in power.,This makes it difficult to push through initiatives that involve a substantial amount of long-term planning and troubleshooting.,In the face of a large budget surplus, the executive team faces considerable pressure to accomplish something “big”—making one large project all the more alluring.,Garcia showed a commendable willingness to assess the value of the fee into question by putting it to a student vote.,The concerns raised at the ASUS annual general meeting by members-at-large are valid.,In light of its outstanding surplus of funds—and lack of a clear plan to dispose of them—it would be inappropriate for ASUS to continue to collect student monies.,At the same time, the ASUS executive needs to ensure that the funds are properly spent, particularly because the amount of unused money is so large."},{"title":"Darts & laurels, 2010-2011","url":"/story/2011-04-07/editorials/darts-and-laurels-2010-2011/","date":"April 7, 2011","content":"Darts:,Laurels:"},{"title":"Civilian justice oversteps","url":"/story/2011-06-28/editorials/civilian-justice-oversteps/","date":"June 28, 2011","content":"Following the Canucks’ Stanley Cup loss, rioters in downtown Vancouver cost the city an estimated $5 million in damages. In response to the destruction, many citizens turned to the Internet as a method to publicly shame those involved.,The high-minded and morally righteous intentions of these residents, such as those on the site “Public Shaming Eternus,” quickly degenerated into an online free-for-all.,The Toronto Star reported that one of the rioters targeted by the site had his address, phone number and other personal information shared. Following threats, his family was forced to flee their home.,Ironically, an astonishing display of civilian justice turned into a vicious mob, similar to riots that followed Game Seven. While the natural reaction to crime is the doling out of swift justice, the shaming websites meant vigilantism escalated to new heights.,While public shaming can be satisfying, it’s the professionals of the police force that are best suited to handle lawbreakers. Untrained civilians lack the tact, skill and restraint that police officers are instructed in.,There’s also no process for citizen vigilantes to follow when enforcing the law. This is concerning when a false accusation can permanently harm someone’s reputation. A photograph that depicts someone in a negative light can deal severe damage, regardless of its accuracy. Perspective and context are everything.,Along with shaming sites, social media had a large part to play in the fallout of the incident. A reported one million photos and 1,000 hours of video depicting the riots have been sent in to the Vancouver police force to aid in investigations. The massive collection has been a boon for police.,As digital technology becomes increasingly intertwined with society, we’re entering a period of hyper-accountability. Looters and rioters have found themselves captured thousands of times and there’s little hope of their identities remaining hidden within a massive crowd. Those who committed theft or acts of violence and assumed impunity have found themselves being pored over by police.,Social media has evolved into an information-gathering tool and is an extension of our identity. When almost every person carries a phone and almost every phone has a camera, anonymity doesn’t seem possible in public.

That which we call a rose/ By any other name would smell as sweet,” I have to disagree.,To me, the name by which we call something is not happenstance. Far from arbitrary, a name is an integral part of that thing. I don’t think words like serendipity, sprezzatura or magnanimous would have the same charm and appeal if the meaning were the same and the word was different.,It’s an idea that lacks a clear logical progression. Do I love the word violin because it’s beautiful, or simply because I love the strains of its strings?,Avoiding that trap, I take as an example my own name: Andrew Fraser Stokes. No other single part of me manages to encompass so much of my identity. Compared to an image or a recording of my voice, my name gives a fuller picture of who I am.,Andrew comes from the Greek word “andron” which means “man,” so my first name essentially equates to manliness—fitting if you’ve ever seen me saw down a tree or rescue a baby from a burning building.,Fraser was my grandmother’s maiden name; a family name that ceased when she married. I carry with me the last remnant of that proud old lineage. I like to think it adds an extra layer of myth and heroism to the baby saving.,And Stokes is my favourite of the three. It’s quick and punchy. I like the look of it.,Stokes carries the stories of my family’s past and it’s a name I’m proud of. Any of the reservations I’ve had about my first two names have never been a factor for Stokes.,As a whole, my name speaks volumes about who I am and who I want to be.,Of course, I don’t expect people to address me by my full name—that would be awkward and cumbersome. But for my sake, don’t take it upon yourself to decide my name is Andy or Drew. I bet there are loads of people who love being called Andy but I’m simply not one of them.,When I hear my name shortened, I cringe. I have the right to tell people what I want to be called but I don’t usually correct them.,So please, call me as I was named. It’s really not too much trouble.

But in retrospect, I’m sorry I didn’t stop to think about her tweets. I briefly read them, but I didn’t “get” them, scrolling passively through my phone. Warnings are easy to forget, but doing so usually results in the universe slapping you in the face.,20 minutes after my social media break, I was driving and got pulled over for texting at a red light. Less than a minute after that Ashton Kutcher coincidentally tweeted, “ACT YOUR AGE.” Insert slap here.,Fair enough Twitterverse, I deserved that. Texting is among the most immature excuses for reckless driving. To try and talk my way out of that ticket would have been a new low.,Luckily, the officer was generous enough to let me off with a warning and some educational facts. According to him, I could have been fined $500 for violating Bill 118, Ontario’s ban on handheld devices. While texting, I had increased my chances of having a car crash by 400 per cent.,Especially in these summer months, reckless driving isn’t just relevant to driving cars. Cottages become a likely place to find groups of people partying on any given weekend. It makes drinking and driving a boat as much of a risk.,This month, a friend of mine died in a drinking and boating accident. He was an older brother and a son, and the words “preventable” and “tragedy” have never rung so true to me.,BOATsmart! Canada made a few strict changes to the official boating license requirements last April. The judicial consequences are now similarly aggressive for drinking and driving boats, cars and snowmobiles in Ontario. The literal and figurative warning signs are present, but apparently my smartphone blocked my view.,It’s by no means an obscure or elusive topic, but it exhaustingly feels like a perpetual problem.

By creating a centralized area for sex trade, the city would both help protect sex workers and cut down on criminal activity associated with human trafficking.,The problem isn’t whether or not creating a red light district is a good idea, but instead where it should be located.,It’s hard to picture the residents of any residential area being open to the idea. The Toronto Island community is no exception, and understandably so.,Any newly-created area associated specifically with sex trade will inevitably be the target of stigma. By placing a red light district—regardless of its size—on the Toronto Island, the City would label the island as a whole.,Even if no existing stigma were present, virulent opposition from the Island’s residents would ensure that the image of the project suffered greatly.,The problem isn’t simply that the residents don’t want to live near a red light district, but that the presence of the district might change the atmosphere of the Island itself.,While it’s unlikely that the Toronto Island would suddenly be overrun with criminal activity, it’s also difficult to imagine it continuing to function as a family-friendly tourist site.,Mammoliti has pointed to the existence of a clothing-optional beach as evidence that the island is already less wholesome than some are willing to admit.,Even if one accepts his line of thought, there’s a substantial difference between a nudity-friendly space and a red light district.,While no community is likely to welcome a red light district with open arms, it’s clear that such an area needs to be established away from a residential community—and on solid ground."},{"title":"Eds, out","url":"/story/2011-04-07/editorials/eds-out/","date":"April 7, 2011","content":"About seven months ago, I put pen to paper—or a less traditional finger to keyboard—on a signed editorial for the Journal, titled “Get in Bed with Eds.” I wasn’t trying to encourage anyone to literally get in bed with me—the Journal prints 6,000 copies every issue, so doing so would set a record for largest in-bed read-in—but instead to explain the role of the Editorials page within the Journal as a whole.,Though the Editorials page acts as the voice of the Journal as a publication, it can’t represent all of its employees at once.

This policy is aimed at children in the 99th weight percentile of their age bracket whose obesity is extremely severe. Examples of cases in the report included a 12-year-old who weighed 400 pounds and a three-year-old who weighed almost 100 pounds.,Health risks from obesity include apnea, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Placing affected children in a new environment, often foster care, is necessary to address the health issues they face.,While placing children in foster care is far from ideal, it’s preferable to keeping them in homes which enabled their morbid obesity. Parents shouldn’t be demonized for having morbidly obese children—after all, societal, cultural and individual factors contribute to the issue—but providing treatment can only serve to improve a child’s quality of life.,Whatever the reason, if parents enable their child’s unhealthy behaviour, the state has a duty to place the child in a safer situation. Most important though is the process of working with the family, so that the child can return to a healthy family environment.,Parents and children in this specific situation need to be educated by nutritionists and tended to by psychologists. Simply removing a child from home doesn’t heal the root causes of overeating. Giving them treatment will allow for a chance at a healthy life—physically, mentally and socially.,Also, removing a child from parental custody due to an extreme case of obesity shouldn’t be treated as a punitive measure. In instances of mental illness for example, there’s no place for blame in this issue. The primary concern is remedying an unhealthy situation.,When children are so severely malnourished and underweight that they’re at risk, they’re taken in and protected by Children’s Aid. Living in a state of morbid obesity is a different side of the same coin and the most essential concern should be for the child’s health.

This allowed Day to keep his title until his resignation.,It’s therefore imperative that an avenue of recourse be established to remove a rector should the need ever arise again.,Given that the position is one mandated to represent students, the power should be in student hands to bring about a rector’s removal.

Since then, I’ve become a lot more informed, and my position is one firmly based in knowledge.,I suppose it’s understandable that young people—busy with school, work and other commitments—would simply support the party or politician their parents or friends support, but with so much information available online it’s hardly difficult to get informed.,Apathy is also understandable if one considers how little their individual vote actually matters among the millions of other votes that are cast.,But at a time when people all over the world are in the pursuit of their right to be “just one vote,” it’s something that we should perhaps value more than we do.,I’m not trying to get all moralistic on you; we’ve all been told enough times in elementary school that people died for our right to vote.

Inmates from minimum-security facilities in the Kingston-area will come into the city two days a week to paint over graffiti.,The Whig-Stardard reported that Mayor Mark Gerretsen told city councillors that city workers can’t keep up with widespread graffiti, necessitating extra help. City council has stated that if the project is successful they will be open to expanding the project to other areas.,With the closing of Kingston’s prison farms, interest in creating work programs has been high. Enlisting inmates to paint over graffiti serves a valuable purpose. The program will contribute to inmates’ rehabilitation, arguably the most important goal of the Correctional Services of Canada.,Portsmouth District councillor Liz Schell has suggested the prisoners could receive a reduced sentence for their work. While serving time is an integral part of Correctional Services, the housing of a detainee is costly, making reduced sentences financially prudent.,With the weak local job market, the union representing the city’s workers has voiced opposition to the program. Because of the low skill set required for painting over graffiti, it’s unlikely the prisoners will take jobs from Kingstonians who need them. In fact, inmates will not be learning valuable skills which they can use upon their release—one flaw in this program.,A concern for many is the seeming danger of having inmates out in the city, but given that the prisoners are all from minimum-security facilities, the danger is negligible. Giving inmates the chance to work for the betterment of society and be rewarded for it helps fight the troublesome label they’re often given. “Convict” carries a stigma that fails to take into account an inmate’s identity.,The work program has minor flaws, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction."},{"title":"Left out on writing?","url":"/story/2011-04-01/editorials/left-out-writing/","date":"April 1, 2011","content":"An article published in the Journal on March 25 considered the status of student writing at Queen’s, as well as the impending preliminary report from the Academic Planning Task Force on April 28.,The Task Force was created to draft a long-term academic plan for the University, in part based on student feedback from Town Hall meetings.,A central concern of the planning process is the gradual slippage of written communication. Members of the task force have pointed to increasing class sizes and early graduation as factors exerting a negative influence on students’ ability to develop writing skills. Others pointed to the lack of training concerning discipline-specific modes of writing in different faculties.,Figuring out how to address a multi-faceted problem is a difficult challenge. One student interviewed in the article suggested the possibility of raising admission averages in areas that are directly related to writing ability—specifically English. Ideally, this measure would make it more likely that students entering university would possess basic writing skills. However, this would do little to help students already enrolled.,Other proposed measures—like a mandatory cross-discipline writing class—would be unproductive. Students would be unlikely to assign much value to a course that emphasized “basic” skills. Discipline-specific writing classes would be more appropriate to the needs of individual faculties—provided all the students have the foundation required.,There’s a crucial difference between basic writing skills and the ability to prepare the types of documentation required in an academic discipline or trade. Learning how to write formally is much easier when students aren’t struggling with basic skills—skills they shouldn’t be learning at the university level.,The article indicated that many students take advantage of the Queen’s Writing Centre, which provides individual consultations across disciplines. Such a service is invaluable, and provided free of charge to Queen’s students.,There are plenty of resources to help students who have difficulty with written communication—but they are all based on individual effort.Effective written communication is as important as the ability to read or do math.

From discussion surrounding Rector Nick Day’s letter and the special vote that took place, to the Alpine Tower controversy at the ASUS Annual General Meeting (AGM), to a motion for AMS to rent a bouncy castle with dancing unicorns and rainbows, I wonder; has this campus gone insane?,This all was made clear to me when I attended last Tuesday’s AMS AGM and the motion to have AMS rent a bouncy castle and have pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows or have their equivalent inside the castle. I don’t know the original intentions of the person who presented the motion, and as the meeting progressed my opinion became very unsure.,Originally I had thought that the intention behind the motion was to prove to the AMS that it’s easy to pass any motion at the AGM, so long as the presenter of the motion has enough student support.,However, as the debate continued, the argument itself became unclear. What originally started as an attempt to encourage student participation in holding student government accountable soon became a push to actually rent a bouncy castle for students.,Some students stated that passing the motion and having a physical bouncy castle in front of a location such as the JDUC will generate student interest. On the other hand, others spoke about how passing the motion and purchasing such a castle would be a waste of time and resources, because if students wanted to be involved they would have come to the AGM.,Some students agreed with the intention behind the bouncy castle, but didn’t believe that the AMS should actually invest in it as a physical entity. That’s when things started getting a little crazy.,There was talk generated that the bouncy castle would be a great resource for students as it would allow them to relive stress.,Others pointed to the logistics of the situation, as they were unsure if the unicorns were supposed to be printed on the bouncy castle or would have to physically be there.,As the lines became unclear, the fact that the motion almost passed with a vote of 54 in favour and 56 against was absolute insanity!,This makes me question, whether or not increased student involvement actually means greater opportunity for betterment, or does it just slow the process down and pose time-consuming objectives along the way?"},{"title":"Digital shadows","url":"/story/2011-05-31/editorials/digital-shadows/","date":"May 31, 2011","content":"As we tweet, comment, like and post on walls, a shadowy digital version of us is compiled in cyberspace.

While it may deter first years from drinking within residence, the policy will send students elsewhere to drink.,The alcohol ban takes frosh away from the care of trained dons who are tasked with looking out for their residents’ well-being. Instead, the downtown bars and house parties of a strange city become an\nattractive option.,No one at a Student Ghetto kegger has been hired to keep first years from binge drinking, and there’s no Campus Observation Room to take them to if they’ve had too much.,There wasn’t an official announcement of the policy. University administrators have remained silent on the issue, failing to explain the reasons behind the alcohol ban. Dons and other residence student leaders have been quiet as well.,Transparency has been absent from the University’s policy but if put in place, it would aid the administration’s cause. If new rules are aimed at preventing alcohol-related deaths, it should be stated.,If the coroner’s report issued to address the deaths of Cameron Bruce and Habib Khan is any indication, then the tragedies of last year serve as an awful reminder of the dangers of alcohol. Instead of being downplayed, telling these stories could shock students into awareness.,The University needs to take a more proactive stance, much in the same way that sex in residence is addressed. Students are handed condoms regardless of their stated intentions, and are prepared should the need arise.,Drinking is common and shouldn’t be swept under the rug; it would be better for dons to hand out water and coach their residents in the recovery position rather than doling out punishment.,Imposing a new rule is not enough to stop common behavior, so policy should be adapted for best practices.,Residence is meant to be a student’s new home, one where they transition from youth into adulthood, but this policy treats first years like irresponsible children.,This policy makes drinking of any kind illicit. It takes a responsibility of adulthood and sets it as off limits.,Judging the success of the policy is also troublesome. There stands the question of what metrics will be used to measure whether the alcohol ban was effective or not.,Regardless of whether the policy continues after Frosh Week, the administration’s decision to ban alcohol is a band-aid solution to a complex issue."},{"title":"Hostile social climbers","url":"/story/2011-02-11/editorials/hostile-social-climbers/","date":"February 11, 2011","content":"New research focusing on teenage aggression and bullying has concluded that many problems originate from an unexpected group.,Sociologists from the University of California surveyed 19 schools in North Carolina and found that students are quite likely to use bullying and aggressive behaviour as means of social climbing. Thus, popular children were much more likely to show signs of aggressive behaviour. The researchers concluded that children are likely treating aggression as a tool to gain or maintain social status. This conclusion is supported by their finding that aggression peaks among children who are just below the top in terms of popularity. They speculated that the most popular children in a social network have no need to advance their perceived level of popularity—and thus don’t resort to bullying behaviour as much as their slightly less-popular peers.,This study has confirmed something that most adolescents already know from first-hand experience. Bullying isn’t limited to threats and intimidation. Reputation is a valuable—and vulnerable—source of social capital.,Any teenager who has had their reputation tarnished by a peer knows that the perpetrator usually stands to gain status by doing so.,One might expect a typical bully to be anti-social and prone to acting out. It’s encouraging that a study like this opposes the stereotype of the maladjusted bully and provides teachers a new perspective on how aggressive behaviour works. However, it’s important to acknowledge the risks of treating one study as conclusive. While certain students may be more likely to engage in aggressive behaviour, any student can bully or be bullied.,Teachers should be prepared to look for instances of bullying on a case-by-case basis, and not get fooled into profiling certain students as instigators.,While the researchers suggest that any anti-bullying measures need to address the perception of bullying as a social tool, it’s hard to be sure how teachers can put this information directly into practice to combat bullying before it starts.,This is further complicated by other forms of bullying, like cyber-bullying, which often occurs outside the school environment—and creates another form of social stratification for students at all levels.,The social dynamics of a high school are instinctual to the students who function within them, but are often opaque to the instructors tasked with maintaining order and discipline.,Giving teachers another perspective to consider may help them recognize bullying behaviour as part of a developing trend, not a personality trait."},{"title":"Please roll responsibly","url":"/story/2011-03-04/editorials/please-roll-responsibly/","date":"March 4, 2011","content":"An article published in the Toronto Star Feb. 28 explores a moral dilemma with a caffeinated twist.,On the 25th anniversary of the annual Tim Hortons Roll Up The Rim contest, the Star article considers the problems raised by purchasing someone a coffee that goes on to win big.,A Tim Hortons spokesperson was quoted as saying that “the simplicity of the contest is what’s so nice about it.” It’s a pleasant idea, but the big-ticket items in the Tim Hortons contest can have divisive outcomes.,One such incident took place in St. Jerome, Quebec in 2006. An elementary school teacher discarded an unrolled coffee cup, which was the winning cup for the contest’s grand prize—a Toyota RAV4.,The cup was rolled by two students who found it in a garbage can, prompting a legal battle between each student and the teacher over who should win the car.,It’s important to acknowledge that this incident speaks more to the desirability of expensive prizes than to any kind of innate greed or pettiness on the part of the public.,At the same time, it’s embarrassing to see people behaving so childishly about an incident of random chance.,Buying someone a coffee with a chance in a draw attached is the same as giving someone a lottery ticket as a gift. The giver has no claim over the recipient, or anything they might win. Holding recipients responsible for sharing what they win begs a silly and similar question—do recipients have the right to hold a buyer responsible when they don’t win something?,The responsibility for deciding what to do with a prize falls on the shoulders of the winner. If he or she feels inclined to share a free coffee or muffin—in part or whole—with the original buyer, he or she should be commended for generous behaviour.,If the winner choses not to do so, everyone involved should acknowledge that they have a reasonable sense of proportion.,Similarly, the responsibility for avoiding unpleasant consequences falls on the shoulders of the buyer, not the winner.

Most important life lesson of second year: Food doesn’t stay fresh forever and your fridge doesn’t miraculously replenish itself with nutritious goodness. Having been spoiled by the cafeterias on campus in first year, upper-year students must come to the realization that they have to buy their own groceries and feed themselves. You can’t sustain yourself off of pizza pops and KD forever.,At first, taking time out of my day to make trips to Loblaws was simply annoying, but with more and more grocery buying experience, I have learned to actually love buying food—despite the fact that I have to drop $150 every time (another life lesson: food is expensive). Strolling through the various aisles is a delight as I imagine eating absolutely everything that I place in my cart and filling my fridge to relieve it of its dark, sad and empty state.,Yet, another great thing about buying food for yourself is knowing that you’ll eat through everything. You don’t buy any unpalatable or unfamiliar dishes (looking at you Leonard Caf), only delicious cuisine that you know you’ll gladly munch.,Some people hate taking the time to make meals, but I actually look forward to coming home and making dinner. There were bumps along the road; there were times where foods were undercooked, burnt, on fire, liquefied, gelatinous and sometimes just downright nasty, but with a little practice my cookery drastically improved.,Whipping up delicious pasta, preparing a fresh salad or throwing together a tasty stir fry is certainly not as hard as I had originally thought.,Who knew that in order to make a stir fry all you need to do is stir and fry?,All in all, being forced to buy groceries and making meals for yourself isn’t as bad as it seems.

But they shouldn’t be too quick to claim to have entered “adulthood”—at least, not according to Manhattan Institute senior fellow Kay Hymowitz.,Hymowitz has published a new book, entitled “Manning Up: How the Rise of Women Has Turned Men Into Boys,” in which she outlines a stage of life called “preadulthood.”,Preadulthood lasts through one’s 20s and 30s, and generally describes the period between exiting the education system and “settling down.” Hymowitz claims that this stage is unique, because it’s a stage where women become the “first sex,” out-performing men in more areas than ever before.,Men are no longer sure how to be masculine, undermined by conflicting expectations of how to behave, as women “expect equality in the workplace but old-fashioned chivalry in their romantic lives.”,Hymowitz said that frustration with mediocrity drives many men to embrace a state of “primal masculinity,” where they model themselves after the frat guy stereotype, drinking beer, playing video games and revelling in all that is crass and juvenile.,Hymowitz also points to “geek,” “emo” and “hipster” personality types as defensive measures adopted by men to distance themselves from women.,There is hope, however far off, as Hymowitz indicates that most “child-men” will grow out of preadulthood in their 30s—or at worst, their 40s.,Hymowitz—or at least, her interview—advances a staggering number of cut-and-dried assumptions. Some are simply outdated, or at best, mis-applied. Many of her conclusions appear to be based on informal feedback and anecdotal evidence.,Suggesting that many socially introverted personality types are simply disguises for bruised egos is a dismissive assertion, and one that fails to take into account how many people might refer to themselves as a “geek” or “hipster”—or both. Hymowitz’s connection of female “dominance” in preadulthood to a devaluation of the father seems a little too simple and direct.,Other suggestions are outright offensive. Hymowitz’s emphasis on the need for new “scripts” for behaviour overlooks the ability of individuals to navigate their lives without resorting to stock gender roles and media tropes. Her articulation of these “scripts” seems linked to her suggestion that feminism is responsible for the priority men place on fatherhood—a remark that devalues the genuine love and care bestowed by a male parent.,The statement that “Women and men are interdependent and it will always be that way and should be that way” is not only exclusive, but embodies the sort of stereotypes targeted by the feminist movement, especially given her suggestion that without women as helpless objects needing protection and shelter, men essentially lose a sense of purpose."},{"title":"Net becomes a snare","url":"/story/2011-02-03/editorials/net-becomes-snare/","date":"February 3, 2011","content":"A controversial decision altering billing for internet providers made by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has sparked anger across the country.,The CRTC announced Tuesday that large telecommunications companies can begin charging smaller subsidiaries on a per-gigabyte basis for Internet bandwidth sold to consumers.,The move is a response to a growing trend of high Internet usage, as Canadians have started to download and watch more television and movies online—especially after the arrival of Netflix in Canada.,The CRTC decision may effectively spell the end of unlimited bandwidth packages for Canadian consumers.,It’s hard to see who benefits from this decision, other than the big telecommunications companies who already enjoy a virtual monopoly. Small businesses are concerned about an unforeseen expense, while others suggest that this ruling might make start-up costs for some businesses even more daunting.,The move punishes a small portion of the population almost exclusively because the average user’s monthly bandwidth needs are a tiny fraction of the most liberal plan.,It’s impossible to overstate the importance of unfettered access to the Internet.

While the move is a response to the club’s methods, not its message, dissembling the two is impossible. CUSA needs to carefully examine the clubs that it endorses for fear of contradicting its own mandate to function as a body free from prejudice.,However, where the student association has a responsibility to facilitate political discourse from all perspectives, Carleton Lifeline has a responsibility to do so in a reasonable manner, in line with the association and the University’s expectations.,It’s easy to see why the University felt it necessary to cut the club’s funding. The graphic display could easily have a serious and disturbing effect on passers-by—especially those unprepared to see it in a public space.,Instead of encouraging discourse and reflection, the display simply marries two overwhelmingly sensitive topics in the least sensitive way possible, trying to elicit disgust and guilt in viewers.

When Lanciault investigated, his son’s teacher reprimanded him for sending his child with Ziploc bags.,Lanciault was quoted as saying “At the end of the day my son doesn’t know why he shouldn’t use a Ziploc bag ... we’re being brainwashed from everywhere.”,The family subsequently wrote about their experience on a blog which attracted attention and comments—some positive, some negative.,This sort of policy is likely an off-shoot of existing “litterless” lunch programs, which encourage students to bring lunches that don’t generate garbage, or make them take home lunch garbage to encourage more eco-friendly meals.,While the plan clearly had good intentions, it seems a little excessive to punish a child for a decision that is likely out of their hands—six-year olds don’t make their own lunches.,If a school administration is seriously concerned about the environment, it would probably be more appropriate for them to reach out to parents directly, instead of demonizing children. Heavy-handed measures might be appropriate for older children, better equipped to handle the issues involved.,Nor is the environmental issue as clear-cut as simply reducing garbage, according to one expert quoted in the Post article. In some cases, “common sense” attitudes about reusable materials don’t take into account disproportionate amounts of energy wasted cleaning and reusing them.,It isn’t that reducing waste is a bad idea—simply that it’s dangerous to force a perspective onto children without understanding the facts behind it.,If educators want children to learn the importance of eco-friendly behaviour, they should teach them in the same way they would teach any other set of ideas, with instructions, explanations and positive feedback—not punishment."},{"title":"Flu myths flights of fancy","url":"/story/2011-02-11/editorials/flu-myths-flights-fancy/","date":"February 11, 2011","content":"An article published in the Journal on Feb. 8 documented a downward trend in Canadian flu vaccinations, which showed a 10 per cent decrease this season.,The article included an interview with Dr. Gerald Anthony Evans, an infectious disease specialist at Queen’s, who suggested that the lowered vaccination rate may be due to “flu fatigue,” which refers to a disinterest in vaccination after the H1N1 pandemic which occurred last year—prompting a spike in vaccination rates.,Evans also pointed to a host of misconceptions surrounding the flu which contribute to a disinterest in vaccination.,For one, the flu vaccine is produced with an inactive virus—so the vaccine can’t give you the flu.,Getting vaccinated doesn’t protect you against every possible iteration of the flu—only the most dominant strains that year.,However, the influenza virus is made up of thousands of strains and getting vaccinated annually significantly increases an individual’s resistance to the flu as a whole.,While the flu isn’t a serious health risk for a healthy individual, it’s dangerous for individuals with weak immune systems, including the elderly and newborn children. Getting vaccinated doesn’t just protect you; it also protects those around you.,Having few available hosts in the population makes it harder for the flu to spread. Everyone should view the flu as a public health issue and treat getting vaccinated as a social responsibility.,It’s likely that health services need to radically adjust their approach to disseminating this information, given the tendency among young people to avoid getting vaccinated. Roughly one in four Canadians gets vaccinated for the flu each year, and Evans said that the rate on campus is even lower.,Health services need to aggressively target young people via the Internet and social media—areas that are currently neglected. Without reaching out to youth directly using a medium they’re already using, indifference and misinformation concerning the flu vaccine will only continue.,Ideally, no one would need to be convinced to get the flu shot. Unless a medical expert advises you otherwise, there’s no reason to avoid getting vaccinated annually."},{"title":"Age of Rage","url":"/story/2011-02-17/editorials/age-rage/","date":"February 17, 2011","content":"I am enraged. Woe is me. We’ve all heard it, whether it’s through our own self-indulgent grumblings about life’s horrible cruelties, or from our housemates’ fits of anger and general despair, the rage is there and it can’t be tamed.,Verbal spewing somehow has a similar effect to vomiting after a night of drinking; it’s nice to get it out, it’s nice to complain. But why do we think anyone cares? Empathy can only go so far, and after listening to people I do in fact hold near and dear to my heart babble on about how much everything sucks, I get bored, unsupportive and I mentally move on.,There’s obviously a lot to complain about in the world. Any form of ‘ism,’ the blatant divide between the global South and the North, our politicians, our economy, Metro’s utter uselessness—the list goes on. An excuse frequently used by enraged citizens, myself included, that we say justifies our anger, is that it’s a realistic way at looking at things.,I’m not promoting ignorance, but mental longevity.,Being angry takes time and mental energy. It’s annoying for everyone around you, and while it clearly serves some form of evolutionary function, it’s not always the most practical of emotions.,Anger is great for the short term, and for issues deeper than a burned pizza, being late to class and a bad mark on a quiz, anger in the long-term en masse has potential to bring about change.,Revolutions don’t occur with people fully content and happy with their situations, they thrive on anger, but anger with a goal and with an optimistic outlook to the future.,Optimism is hard, but it isn’t without its benefits.,While it may be more enjoyable to scream at the top of your lungs about how much you hate everything, how angry you are and how much the world sucks, your throat eventually dries up and you are forced to stop shouting, perhaps one of life’s cruel tricks.,We have maybe 80 years to live. There’s plenty of time and reason for anger and complaining, and perhaps we are all destined to become bickering, grumpy and old men and women.,While peppy over-done optimism is certainly as annoying as perpetual whining, there is a balance between the two, and in an inspired fit of happiness instead of my perpetual rage.,Today, I’m looking at the glass half-full."},{"title":"Typeface & cyberspace","url":"/story/2011-03-11/editorials/typeface-and-cyberspace/","date":"March 11, 2011","content":"From a 2007 documentary on Helvetica to a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship for typeface design, fonts and typefaces have recently gained popularity and prestige in the public eye.,A Globe and Mail article published March 5 links this spike in visibility to the advent of technology. Where handwriting was once a vital skill—with students spending hours a day in practice—learning cursive is increasingly marginalized in the classroom, supplanted largely by time allotted to keyboarding.,There are two sides to the debate. One suggests that handwriting is a key element of the expressive process and that computers have a stifling effect on creativity.,However, the Globe article credits typing—and typefaces—as a handy defence for those who struggle with bad handwriting. Furthermore, some argue that an increasingly broad range of available fonts allows typists a level of personal expression that one wouldn’t normally associate with typed text.,In an age where most communication occurs electronically, it’s undoubtedly more practical for students to be taught typing at an early age. Typing is also more efficient than handwriting—it isn’t hard to learn to type faster than one can write.,At the same time, the importance of handwriting for creative endeavours can’t be overstated. Where typing might be fast, handwriting often helps one internalize information on the fly, instead of simply transcribing mass amounts of information in one sitting. In addition, while handwriting might become less important, neat writing will always be a useful skill. Until assessments are conducted electronically, those with poor penmanship will always run the risk of incomprehensibility.,Regardless of which side of the debate one endorses, practical considerations apply on both sides.,Handwriting and typing are both forms of expression, and the content matters most. Getting this material across is a top priority, but typists need to recognize that the ease and speed of typing also makes it easier to overlook mistakes.,While cursive will likely fall into disuse with the passage of time, writing effectively may become faster, but certainly no easier."},{"title":"Autonomy, or monotony","url":"/story/2011-03-18/editorials/autonomy-or-monotony/","date":"March 18, 2011","content":"On March 10, AMS Assembly deliberated a motion that read as follows: “That AMS Assembly directs the Media Services Director to conduct an analysis of the content of The Queen’s Journal during the current academic year and to subsequently report on the percentage of content that directly addresses student activities and events.”,The motion passed by 21 votes to seven, with four abstentions.,The Journal’s editorial staff believe that this motion poses a direct threat to the editorial autonomy of this publication, and interferes with its ability to function in line with its existing mandate.,The AMS Assembly is the highest legislative body of the corporation that publishes the Journal. The Journal’s responsibility to its publisher is limited to its financial operations alone. Thus, the AMS has no influence upon or control over the Journal’s content.,This arrangement is not informal.AMS by-law 13.01.03 states, “It is recognized and affirmed that it is in the best interests of the Society members, and of the University community, that the Queen’s Journal be free from the influence of student government and outside institutions with regards to its editorial integrity and accordingly, that it be independent of the Board both as to management and editorial control.”,Section 15.01.04 of the AMS constitution indicates that the responsibility of the Editor(s) in Chief to AMS Assembly as concerns editorial content is that the Journal “does not contain any material which is of a seditious, libellous or scandalous nature, or which constitutes an invasion of privacy or violation of copyright or proprietary right.”,Surveying the Journal’s content for relevance does not fall under any of those headings.,The autonomy granted to the Journal by the governance documents of the AMS is not a free license. This publication is granted editorial autonomy with the responsibility outlined in the AMS Constitution, section 15.01.01.iii.b, “to give an accurate account of news relevant to the University, and to discuss questions of current interest.” In other words, the Journal has a responsibility to provide the Queen’s community with relevant coverage, but to do so in a manner free from outside influence.,For AMS Assembly to ask any questions about the Journal’s content not only contravenes its own bylaw, it also represents a threat to the ability of this publication to function as a source of independent and objective coverage.,The Journal doesn’t oppose the goal of this motion—only the forum in which it is being pursued.,AMS Assembly isn’t the place to raise grievances about the Journal’s content. Instructing the Media Services Director—an employee of the AMS with a fiduciary relationship to the Journal—to audit its content gives that individual a task that falls entirely outside his or her purview. Our editorial content should be solely the concern of our readers—the Queen’s community as a whole.,The community of this university is composed of a diverse group of individuals with an equally diverse range of interests. In order to reach as much of the student body as possible, the Journal strives to cater to a variety of interests by offering news, athletic, creative and artistic content, in-depth coverage and human interest material.,Ideally, the Journal would possess sufficient resources and staff to provide comprehensive coverage—reporting on every event of any relevance to the Queen’s community.,This is not the case.,For this reason, the editorial staff must decide what material appears in the Journal—and consequently, what material is not covered or published. This decision is directly based on the editors’ perception of how accessible the story is to the Queen’s community as a whole—in other words, its relevance.,Therefore, it’s crucial to recognize the distinction between relevance and comprehensiveness. The Journal may never be entirely comprehensive, but it is always relevant.,It sets a bad precedent for a discussion of the Journal’s editorial content to occur anywhere within the structure of our publisher. The final say on “relevance” cannot rest anywhere but inside the Journal and with its readers, unless the Journal’s content is determined according to an artificial and external framework. The creation of such a framework would effectively neutralize the Journal’s mandate, “to give an accurate account of news and events relevant to the University, including elections, AMS Assembly, the Corporation and referenda, and to discuss questions of current interest.”,The Journal’s staff aren’t afraid of being held to that standard. We firmly believe that every piece of media in this newspaper is relevant to some or all portions of the Queen’s community, and that any reasonable assessment will support this belief.,Our belief in our relevance to the student body stems not from arrogance or single-mindedness, but from our recognition that we would no longer serve a purpose if our readers weren’t interested in the content that we publish.,Putting together a newspaper requires an investment of time and energy—an investment that is only worthwhile if the material we print actually matters.,That’s not to say that the Journal’s editors, writers and contributors don’t make mistakes. If you take issue with the content provided in this publication, exercise your right to have input on the material we provide. Ideally, each student on this campus would scrutinize every issue of the Journal—and hold our work to the most exacting standard possible.,No one is obliged to read the Journal. Members of this community are free to disregard it as they see fit—but anyone wishing to do so has a responsibility to allow us to respond to their grievances first.,Don’t reject our content because of a misspelt name or misplaced period.,Don’t demean our publication because you feel that our coverage is unbalanced.,Instead, treat your concerns as an opportunity to engage us in discussion and keep us accountable.,Read one of our articles. Read all of our articles. Check facts. Go online and explain why an article is great. Go online and explain why an article is terrible. Come to open editorial board—next Tuesday at the Grad Club. Write a letter to the editor. Write several letters to the editor.,When we screw up, don’t jump to conclusions—ask questions.,Start this discussion in the right place—start it with us, not against us."},{"title":"Ambition mission","url":"/story/2011-02-03/editorials/ambition-mission/","date":"February 3, 2011","content":"Have you ever realized there are only a couple hundred people in this school? Or so you’d think if you pay even passing attention to student politics.,If you’ve been here for a few years, you must have noticed this pattern by now—an isolated group, a small segment of the student population, garners a relatively large amount of attention in this school. These are the people who spend their time in university immersing themselves in student government, campus media, athletics, philanthropy and other pursuits. These individuals pulse in and out of the spotlight, changing allegiances and occupations along the way.,Some of the more prominent ones even catch the attention of average students. The AMS and faculty elections make this phenomenon especially palpable, but it’s a perennial trend. There’s a tendency to label them as instigators, social climbers and many other pejoratives.,We need to evaluate prominent individuals in our community on the basis of their quantifiable skills and abilities, not our perception of their appetite for power.,To want more for yourself—whether in terms of wealth, notoriety or any other good—isn’t evil, it’s a natural human motivator. We need to fight the stigma surrounding ambition and change the cadence with which we address people who display it.,I’m asking you to start evaluating more constructive metrics, like a person’s intelligence. It’s a recipe for disaster—we can’t afford to blindly discredit people for a demonstrated lack of humility.,It’s important to change our attitudes now because university is a microcosm of society. The same people that contend for leadership positions here will do so in the real world, when the stakes are much higher.,It might be true that aspirations don’t always breed acumen, and people who are driven toward success are not always the most intelligent or talented members of the community. This is simply because they’re the most visible.,But ambition must be viewed as its own merit. The most innovative ideas are never implemented except for the devotion of ambitious people. That’s why we need to fight the stigma surrounding this vital character trait, even in our miniature society.,In a world where ambition is vilified, the mediocre are sure to thrive."},{"title":"Right-wing news blues","url":"/story/2011-03-04/editorials/right-wing-news-blues/","date":"March 4, 2011","content":"An editorial written by Robert F.

Kennedy praises Canada’s Radio Act, which mandates that “a licensee shall not broadcast ... any false or misleading news.”,The adjusted regulation would have applied only in cases where a media outlet was aware that the information was false and when the information “endangers or is likely to endanger the lives, health or safety of the public.” Kennedy links the Radio Act to Quebecor Media’s attempt to start a new right-wing network called “Sun TV News” in Canada.,He also denounces American media coverage as “toxic, overtly partisan, biased and dishonest.” American media was formerly subject to the “Fairness Doctrine,” which applied discretionary regulations to fair and equitable coverage in the press.,It was abolished in 1987. It’s a stretch to connect Sun TV News directly to the changes in the Radio Act.,At the same time, Kennedy is right to commend Canadian media regulations. While no media outlet can ever claim to be entirely unbiased, each must be held to the highest possible standard of accountability.,Allowing media outlets to lie when misinformation does not directly endanger the public sets a bad precedent.,Outlets may plead ignorance of their falsity and to the consequences of their actions at the time of publication.,In an age where political discourse is increasingly adversarial, the public must be insulated from misinformation as much as possible.,By virtue of wide reach and great resources, media outlets have an immense power to influence public opinion.,If this power doesn’t come with a mandate to present the truth—or at least, to not present lies—the very idea of “news” is compromised."},{"title":"Losing sheen","url":"/story/2011-03-11/editorials/losing-sheen/","date":"March 11, 2011","content":"There is so much happening in the world right now, notably the historic revolutions which have been sweeping Northern Africa for months.,But there is one mind-boggling, continually evolving and arguably also historic event that has entirely consumed the attention of the general public.,What is going on in the mind of Charlie Sheen?,Here is a classic example of a celebrity meltdown, and it’s of epic proportions.,I attribute Charlie’s ridiculousness to three possible motives. One: he naturally defies social conventions and graces and is now under some misguided perception that his personality is completely acceptable to share with the world. Two: he willfully seeks worldwide media attention (which has disturbingly yet predictably obliged him) by aiming to defy said social conventions and graces in the most outlandish, bizarre and just nonsensical way possible. Three: he has a mental illness. If the answer is number three, Charlie’s antics make me wonder if it’s ethical for us to find amusement in what many consider to be clear signs of serious psychiatric issues, instead of encouraging him to seek professional help.,We are all bearing witness to a now-fallen star publicly losing both his sanity and dignity, and all we can do is laugh at his clear descent into madness? I don’t want to discuss my interpretations of Sheen’s bizarre, coded ramblings—I think its safe to say at this point that fire breathing fists, goddesses, tiger blood, winning, etc. are all beyond my and the general public’s comprehension. Yet despite my inability to understand him, I remain intrigued.,He claims it’s not an act. He has somehow managed to (shockingly) pass drug tests. So what provokes these tiger blood musings and goddess-praising rants? I will not worship the fallen or bow down to anyone having a meltdown, and neither should anyone else. However, the media’s incessant coverage and the unquenchable interest of the public have clearly proven that we are both unable and unwilling to look away.,His tirades are endlessly fascinating because they are so mystifying, and as society we collectively struggle in our attempts to decipher the meaning or motivation behind them.,I guess this is all pretty harmless, but it’s important to remember that just because somebody is publicized does not mean they should be idolized—no matter how endlessly fascinating they may be."},{"title":"Gut reaction","url":"/story/2011-03-18/editorials/gut-reaction/","date":"March 18, 2011","content":"Signifying demonic possession, pregnancy or food/alcohol poisoning, vomiting is usually banished to the confines of toilets, sinks and in the worst cases, our friends. But lately I’ve noticed vomit making its way into music videos. Absurd? Maybe … bear with me.,About a month ago I watched Tyler, The Creator’s stark video for his single “Yonkers.” The west-coaster had me captivated, spitting his trademark aggravated baritone while delicately balancing a cockroach as it crawled through his fingers. Then he appears to bite the cockroach’s head off.,Before I could be sick, he beat me to it—at this point in the video, the camera shifts back and out of focus as he turns to give viewers a perfect profile of his projectile.,The video’s reception on the web shocked me. Rather than an outpouring of comments peppered with disgust and horror, “Yonkers” was immediately dubbed artistically groundbreaking and poignant.,This dude must be next level if his vomit is charismatic.,It’s not a new concept. The act of on-screen vomiting is familiar to fans of Family Guy and in the humor of films like Monty Python’s the Meaning of Life, Jackass and Team America: World Police. The Prodigy shocked audiences with their MTV-banned “Smack My Bitch Up,” in which the central character takes a break from debauchery for a quick puke-and-rally.,The social constructions surrounding what is considered foul and what is considered funny or artistic have evolved. Wait, aren’t we supposed to be embarrassed and ashamed of our bodily functions? Perhaps not when an artistic purpose may be served.,Some camps stick to viewing vomit as a sign of weakness and vulnerability, a lack of control—while others claim it as a hardcore sign or even goal of the ultimate bad-ass night out.,PS I Love You jumped on the bandwagon too with their new release “Get Over,” filmed at Kingston’s own Grad Club. The track’s grinding riffs provide the soundtrack for an out-of-control house party, complete with karaoke and herbal refreshments.,The band’s hyper-reality culminates into a group vomit session. It might elicit an “it-was-cool-until-the-throw-up” response from some, but it’s pretty rock and roll if you can stomach it.,After all, what’s a music video if not a place to pick a defined visual aesthetic in the service of your tunes—whatever that may be to the artist?"},{"title":"Cop Flops","url":"/story/2011-03-04/editorials/cop-flops/","date":"March 4, 2011","content":"On Jan. 24, a Toronto police officer told a group of Osgoode law students that women could avoid sexual assault by not dressing like “sluts.” The officer, who has remained anonymous, was speaking at a campus safety meeting at York University in Toronto.,He has already received an official reprimand and issued a formal apology to the students involved.,Never will I understand how or why public servants still have next to no knowledge on the dangers of candid speech.,Or, if they do, ignore it entirely during public address.,Put simply: if your mouth doesn’t have a filter, keep to cue cards. As an individual, the world is your forum to speak openly and without fear.,However, when an individual speaks as a representative from a larger group (say, oh, the Toronto police force) there is danger in loose-lipped behaviour.

These rodents not only plague our campus, but share one quality in particular that I find increasingly disturbing: stealth.,One particular memory exemplifies what I’m talking about. In my second year, my housemate Robbie was found yelling ‘shoo, shoo’ rather forcefully in his bedroom.,A squirrel had broken into his second floor room and was found eating through a bag of mixed nuts.,I have never been as impressed by a Queen’s squirrel as I was at that moment.,It somehow had managed to crawl through a narrow window opening and find its perfect meal before escaping unharmed.,The squirrels that roam campus and the student ghetto have always scared me and this incident only confirmed my judgements. As one friend remarked to me yesterday, “squirrels are evil.” Each time I hear about another squirrel break-in or see a group of them rummaging through garbage, I am more convinced of this. With patchy fur and beady eyes, they are far from their cute cartoon counterparts.,There is one redeeming thing about Queen’s squirrels—their place in the University’s traditions. Over the years I have heard various versions of the myth of the golden squirrel, but there is one I find especially convincing.,Apparently there is a golden squirrel at Queen’s, which if sighted before midterms, foreshadows failing marks.,Alternatively, if the golden squirrel is sighted after midterms, the semester’s finals will be aced.,It’s my belief that the legendary golden squirrel is actually albino, after hearing descriptions of it from friends who’ve seen it.,I suppose then that the squirrels of Kingston will remain pests in my mind with one exception.,I myself have never seen the golden squirrel but perhaps I will be lucky enough to bear witness to its existence, preferably after midterms."},{"title":"Aberdeen & agony","url":"/story/2010-12-02/editorials/aberdeen-and-agony/","date":"December 2, 2010","content":"A story published Nov. 26 on queensjournal.ca detailed Principal Daniel Woolf’s decision to suspend Fall Homecoming for a further three years.,Woolf cited ongoing concerns about the annual unsanctioned Aberdeen Street Party as influencing his decision. While he acknowledged that attendance is down, he indicated his belief that any reversal of the suspension would simply encourage large crowds to return and continue to threaten public safety and the University’s reputation.,Principal Woolf faced a daunting decision. There are many different perspectives on the issues surrounding Homecoming weekend, and satisfying everyone was never a possibility.,Despite being a separate event, Homecoming Weekend has become synonymous with the Aberdeen Street Party. It’s disappointing that an outright cancellation of the former is the current solution to the problems posed by the latter.,There are some unexplored avenues which could help the University and the City of Kingston negotiate the issues posed by the street party, such as attracting crowds to other venues in the city, or continuing to present a strong police presence on Aberdeen Street without cancelling Homecoming Weekend—both of which would help underscore that the two are not interchangeable.,However, previous attempts at accommodation—including road closures and harm reduction—ended in failure. In light of the street party’s high profile, it would be counter-productive for the University to take any steps that might encourage attendance on Aberdeen Street. The window for a university-sanctioned event has closed—at least for the foreseeable future.,In reality, “solving” the Aberdeen Street problem isn’t the University’s responsibility. Well-intentioned emails from the administration—and a strong police presence—have failed to drop attendance to zero. The responsiblity is on the shoulders of anyone who shows up on Aberdeen Street, even those who claim that they just want to see the spectacle. This behaviour only draws attention to the Aberdeen issue—from both the public and the media. Students and alumni who decry the cancellation as an assault on tradition are right to complain. But Homecoming Weekend has ceased to be about the traditions of one’s alma mater, eclipsed instead by a tradition of shameful behaviour and resultant bad press.,Regardless of whether or not the problems originate from Queen’s students as a group, they will ultimately face most of the consequences. While the loss of a tradition is a tragedy, it’s a greater tragedy that current and future generations of students suffer because of the actions of a select few. Students and alumni alike should embrace other routes of getting in touch with the Queen’s community of the past and present, and form traditions that haven’t been stained by memories of flipped cars and students in handcuffs."},{"title":"French smoke & mirrors","url":"/story/2011-01-25/editorials/smoke/","date":"January 25, 2011","content":"French lawmakers have taken steps to adjust France’s rigid anti-smoking laws, citing concerns about endangering the country’s “cultural heritage.” The so-called “Evin” law prohibits any “direct or indirect” promotion of tobacco or tobacco products.,Fear over falling onto the wrong side of the law meant pictures of iconic French figures like Jean-Paul Sartre were altered to remove cigarettes on posters and book covers.,The bill brought before parliament equated this with “the falsification of history, the censorship of works of the mind, [and] the denial of reality,” which it insisted “must remain the heinous marks of totalitarian regimes.”,There’s no denying that limiting cigarette advertisement and sponsorship is a good idea, but censoring photographs of famous figures is a step too far.,It’s simply a reality that some of history’s famous figures have been smokers. By creating a “safe” version of a famous photograph, one draws attention to whatever one is trying to hide—an enterprise doomed to failure in the age of the Internet.,Instead of trying to hide a dirty secret about a famous figure, the public should be prepared to acknowledge the truth about how he or she lived.,In the case of something as common as a cigarette, the adage “out of sight, out of mind” simply doesn’t hold up. As long as cigarettes are still available to the public, the most responsible course of action is to acknowledge that they remain a public health risk, and one that was once almost ubiquitous.,It’s true that photographs of famous figures smoking adds to the glamour of cigarettes as a product, but these photographs are significantly less harmful than advertising, which targets individuals with demographic-relevant material and images of smoking that are deliberately enticing.

They insist that the solution is more disclosure, not secrecy.,The wide purview of the new rules is also problematic, as some have suggested that it could be applied outside of the Royal Family to any of its staff, effectively creating a publication ban of any documentation relating to the activities of the monarchy.,Since the Royal Family draws on funds dispersed by the government, the government should be held accountable for how that money is spent.

While some abandon these resolutions long before the summer months begin, a US website is offering an added incentive to would-be fitness buffs: cash.,HealthyWage.com offers dieters $100 if they manage to reach a pre-determined weight-loss target within a given time frame. Those willing to put their own money into the program can reap larger rewards—an investment of $300 can yield more than triple that amount. The website has signed up more than 75,000 participants in the two years since its creation, and plans to reach the Canadian market this year.,The HealthyWage model is borne out by some research into incentive-motivated weight loss, and it isn’t the first institution to link addressing health issues to gaining rewards. However, this particular combination seems fraught with risks.,The HealthyWage plan doesn’t appear to ensure that an individual adopts a healthy plan to lose weight. While the website partners with established gyms and fitness centres, the weight targets it measures are simply confirmed at the beginning and ending of the target period by a doctor or at an accredited location—the weight loss doesn’t have to be monitored by an expert. ,Furthermore, the targets are determined by using Body Mass Index, a hard-and-fast measurement that isn’t accurate for every individual.,For an individual in average health and average shape simply looking to shed a few pounds, the HealthyWage program might provide the right incentive to inspire lasting change.,However, it’s likely that a program like HealthyWage might motivate an individual to use risky or drastic measures in order to hit a target weight.,This isn’t just dangerous, it’s counter-productive, as it doesn’t ensure that the individual maintains a healthy bodyweight or lifestyle after completing the program. ,In order for the HealthWage plan to work ideally, it would have to ensure healthy and safe weight loss. This would have to include an emphasis on stable eating habits to protect against post-regiment weight gain, as well as monitoring pre-existing medical conditions, which might be aggravated by certain types of exercise or pound-shedding activities.,It’s irresponsible to tempt people who require serious support and structure with the distant promise of quick cash.

I’m certainly no optimist, but I hope that my contribution to the world will leave it in a better place than it was when I first entered it.,Volunteering—something that my bleeding heart has a large soft spot for—is an activity that society looks upon with keen interest. Volunteering is something that is meant to humble and educate you, especially when volunteering with those who are ‘less fortunate’ than you.,But what is it about volunteering that leaves celebrities clambering to the nearest African orphanage and members of religious organizations dutifully serving the homeless at local soup kitchens every weekend?,In general, I don’t think it’s for the betterment of the affected communities. Not real, sustainable betterment at least. Volunteering can be an exploitive, almost voyeuristic activity, depending on the situation and the motivations behind the volunteer. I was volunteering earlier this week, and a couple of high-school boys had also signed up with me. Though the boys did their jobs, they goofed around, laughed behind the patrons’ backs, and didn’t appear to understand the importance of the work that they were doing.,When another volunteer chatted to them about why they were there—after they complained that their feet hurt from walking around too much—the boys informed us that they were only volunteering to fill their 40 hours of mandatory community service.,This mandatory ‘volunteering’ is apparently meant to teach teenagers some humility and perspective, but I saw little of that. Instead, I saw adolescents who were well aware of their class privilege, mocking the actions of those with none.,Volunteering can have a dark side, especially when dealing with differences in power dynamics. This is only one example and the typical immaturity of teenage boys is common knowledge, but it made me wonder why we volunteer.,The reality is hard to admit, but I would say it’s true for most. Volunteering feels good, it gives us a sense of purpose, and in many contexts it makes us feel better about our situations. When done in large groups with people from similar backgrounds, it appears to almost act as group therapy.,Yet, society needs volunteers as much as volunteers need the defined role that their commitment offers them. Volunteering is an essential activity, but stop blindly following others into it, if you are like many who believe that three hours spent dishing out soup to the hungry can change lives.,Before your good-Samaritan-self signs up for some more volunteer shifts, think about why you are doing it.

We can all handle being embarrassed from time to time.,I believe there’s a definite distinction to be made between embarrassing and awkward moments. Embarrassment is, most of the time, caused by circumstances that either don’t reflect your character or are outside your control. Most importantly, you’ll eventually laugh about embarrassment later (or much much later, depending on the severity of the incident).,Awkwardness is more a state of being. If you’re awkward, you most likely embarrass yourself on a routine basis. No matter how long ago your awkward encounters took place, they never become funny—just cringe-worthy. As a self-declared awkward person, I know.,It’s like the difference between watching people show their messy houses on TLC’s Hoarders and watching Kristen Stewart stammer her way through an acceptance speech—one is horribly fascinating, while the other makes you change the channel.,University is an environment in which awkward encounters thrive. I naively thought I would grow out of it over time, but I’m in my third year and my life still consists of asking “why the hell did I just do that?” at least once daily.,However, I don’t think I’m completely alone. A friend recently admitted to me, “I sometimes just feel like everyone thinks I’m so weird!” I was shocked, as she’s one of the funniest people I know.,So what’s going on? Is our generation turning into the awkward generation?,Maybe it has something to do with the constant pressure people have to deal with; it feels like almost every encounter matters. Getting jobs and networking, giving a killer presentation or meeting the parents of a significant other—first impressions seem to make or break almost everything.,Despite this pressure, chances are we see ourselves in a much harsher light than others do. And they’re probably too worried about how they look to others to remember how dumb you sounded that time. So, cut yourself some slack.

A recent episode of Jersey Shore had Snooki treating a hangover by just remaining drunk, taking shots with tourists and getting arrested. Teen Mom 2 featured a teenage mother who verbally and physically assaulted her own mother after being deemed an unfit parent.,But the criticism levelled at MTV didn’t target any of these so-called ‘reality’ shows. Instead the focus was on a British import called Skins, which has caused a fuss amongst advertisers and the Parents Television Council.,Skins is meant to portray a realistic version of being a modern teenager. The show has nothing to do with vampires, the Upper East Side or anonymous bloggers, and more to do with out-of-control parties, sex and drugs. The fuss around the show reminds me of a childhood favourite of my own. I was just a baby when Degrassi premiered on CBC. I caught syndicated episodes when I was in elementary school and, with the exception of the dated clothing and unfamiliar references, that show taught me what to expect in high school. If you smoked a joint, rehab would soon follow. If you had sex, watch out! Becoming a teen mom would be the next logical step. If you drank at a party while your friend’s parents were out of town, the cops would be called, someone would get alcohol poisoning and your boyfriend would cheat on you.,Degrassi should and has been applauded for representing realistic situations and has not shied away from difficult issues such as abortion, homosexuality and drug use.,What astounds me is that this show premiered in the late ’80s. Recent shows have been unable to fill the hole that Degrassi left. Even The Next Generation plays more like an afterschool special.,The refreshing nature of Skins is partly due to the lack of immediate consequences and the non-judgement of the characters’ behaviour. Degrassi never steered me the wrong way in high school, even with frank discussion on teen pregnancies, suicide and drug use. Degrassi brought much-needed attention to teenage issues, which is what Skins has done in its native England.,MTV should examine the rest of its content before bowing down to critics of a fictionalized show."},{"title":"Student depression rises","url":"/story/2011-01-28/editorials/student-depression-rises/","date":"January 28, 2011","content":"An article published in the National Post on Jan. 24 described the unsettling results of a study focusing on student mental health.,A team of US and Canadian researchers surveyed students who visited campus health resources.,They discovered that 25 per cent showed signs of clinical depression, while 10 per cent admitted having thoughts about suicide. The researchers behind the study insist that campus health centres need a blanket mental health screening policy, in order to catch students who might otherwise go undetected.,The results of this study are troubling, and point to a need for greater on-campus resources to address mental health problems. Many of the students initially sought help for physical ailments, but later admitted to depression-related concerns. This suggests that a certain amount of stigma still surrounds mental health issues.,Students need to feel comfortable addressing concerns about their mental health and seeking help when they feel they need it.,Support at the campus level needs to come from peers, health resources and instructors, all of whom need to be informed about the serious consequences of undiagnosed health issues.,While instructors are sometimes completely disinterested in the personal lives of their students, they need to be prepared to tackle these issues as they arise. University dons and residence life staff have a valuable opportunity to teach first-year students about early signs of depression—an opportunity which must be capitalized upon.,It’s important to recognize the limitations of this study. It concluded that 25 per cent of students showed symptoms of depression, not depression itself—a crucial distinction in many cases.,It’s also important that individuals be concerned about their long-term mental state and recognize that what they consider an ordinary emotional experience could be one of distress.,There are no easy solutions to this problem. Where many campus health experts agree with the need for additional support, they insist that they lack the resources they require.

The study estimates this food represents a value of roughly $27 billion.,Some experts point to a breakdown in communication between different parts of the food industry, where producers and retailers look only at the most cost-effective models, not those which help diminish wasted food. Others emphasize the difficulty of generating funds to address the problem. It’s much harder to track food than other common forms of household waste which are difficult to dispose of, like electronic equipment.,The Star article is also critical of using the green bin. One expert brands the food waste container “a guilt eraser.” He suggests that the green bin convinces people that they’re doing the right thing by keeping the food out of a landfill, when they may simply be disguising waste—transport and delivery of uneaten food still generates pollution. While it’s too strong of a conclusion that the green bin does more harm than good, consumers should be paying close attention to where unwanted food material comes from, and where it ends up.,Food waste is also an issue outside of the home, with restaurants contributing to the problem by offering extra-large portions and all-you-can-eat-buffets.,In many ways, wasting food is an invisible issue. While resources exist to tell people what to eat if they want to lose weight and get healthy, little attention is paid to buying and consuming efficiently.,Individual preferences contribute to this issue as well.Consumers won’t purchase anything but the freshest produce, meaning that cosmetic appeal becomes as important as nutritional value. This means that edible food gets thrown out needlessly.,Similar concerns about appearance and taste turn consumers off of frozen foods, which can be stored longer and are less susceptible to being wasted.,Consumers should be more open to consciously adjusting their purchasing to minimize waste, and making responsible decisions about portion size and consumption."},{"title":"Fame games drain brains","url":"/story/2011-01-14/editorials/fame-games-drain-brains/","date":"January 14, 2011","content":"In a column published Jan. 8 in the Globe and Mail, Leah McLaren considers the changing nature of fame. The column—titled “Go on, get famous—you’ll be the envy of idiots everywhere”—points to the ongoing worship of fame and the acquisition of celebrity as the ultimate validation of talent.,However, McLaren points to a gradual backslide in celebrity lifestyle. High-profile individuals are moving from glitz and glamour to sleaze and scandal.,McLaren points to websites like Facebook and YouTube, that let ordinary individuals draw attention to themselves in the same way a celebrity might. Reality TV brought this celebrity into the mainstream. This “democratization of fame” led to a “devaluation of celebrity.” McLaren consults American cultural critic Cintra Wilson, who claims that we have witnessed the “collapse of fame.” As individuals became increasingly public, celebrities became disposable, and fell prey to addiction and melodrama.,It’s hard to argue with the conclusion McLaren offers—that fame can be a dangerous and warping experience. But fame and infamy are different things. Not every celebrity succumbs to drug addiction or high-profile heartbreak, nor is it reasonable to suppose that this is a phenomenon unique to this generation. Celebrities have always been embroiled in scandal; television and the Internet simply made this scandal more public.,McLaren points to an age of “obsessive image-management.” It’s important to acknowledge that not every infamous celebrity is entirely lacking self-awareness. Many trade on, or play up, a persona in order to reap the benefits of fame—hardly an innovation of the 21st century.,It’s also important to recognize that sometimes celebrities don’t seem like real people—we’re so used to seeing them in the public eye that even their real lives turn into fiction.,Celebrity and fame are frequently by-products of being part of something that is simply popular, not laudable or impressive. However, this signals only that fame is changing, not that it has died—and that it has always been arbitrary. McLaren describes a celebrity’s spiral out of control as a “spectacle of celebrity toxicity,” but the spectacle reflects as much about the audience as the performers. Though unpleasant to acknowledge, it’s gratifying to wallow in the dirty laundry of others, confident that we can hop out at our leisure.,What we deem famous—and more broadly, who deserves the title of “celebrity”—reveals a great deal about ourselves."},{"title":"Coffee in a Star-bucket","url":"/story/2011-01-21/editorials/coffee-star-bucket/","date":"January 21, 2011","content":"Regular visitors to their neighbourhood Starbucks will be pleased to hear about the addition of a new beverage size. The Seattle-based coffee company has announced plans to introduce a 31 oz. serving size in its chain locations across the US no later than May 3. ,The new “Trenta” size will be available in more than eleven states by the beginning of February, and costs only 50 cents more than the “Venti” size—which ranges from 20 to 24 oz. The 917 ml Trenta container is intended for iced beverages, like flavoured coffees, iced tea and lemonade. These beverages typically come loaded with space-consuming ice, so a larger size provides greater relief from hot weather.  ,At first, this move seems like a simple publicity ploy. Where an ,“extra-large” beverage option is the standard at traditional chain retailers, Starbucks isn’t the first company one might picture adopting a fast-food model. The chain’s emphasis on trendy decor and upscale coffee beverages has previously leaned towards a certain degree of restraint and understatement. ,Starbucks has stated that the new beverage size is a response to customer demand, which reflects the company’s gradual expansion into less urban areas. In an urban environment, Starbucks is a daily norm, but in areas where the concentration of the chain is less dense, it becomes a rare treat—and an indulgence.,At the same time, Starbucks is facing great competition to retain its loyal customers. Many of the previously-esoteric beverage options it has brought into the mainstream have been adopted by other chain coffee shops and retailers, including McDonalds. Offering larger serving sizes across the board ensures that people get even more of their familiar favourites straight from the source.   ,It’s a sound business move, but the new size seems a little overboard. Where the Trenta is intended for specific beverages, especially thirsty customers will surely load one up with their favourite cream- and sugar-laden drinks.,While no Canadian release is yet on the horizon, if the idea takes hold below the border, it can only be a matter of time."},{"title":"Leave space to embrace","url":"/story/2011-01-25/editorials/space/","date":"January 25, 2011","content":"In an article published Jan. 20, the Globe and Mail’s Zosia Bielski considers the problems facing school administrators as they try to curb student misbehaviour.,The misbehaviour in question is of a decidedly unexpected sort; not aggression or truancy, but an epidemic of in-school hugging.,Certain schools in the US and Britain have taken aggressive steps to curb demonstrations of student affection. Measures include outright bans of physical contact to more permissive approaches that spare handshakes or allow hugging after scoring a point in basketball.,School administrators present a variety of justifications for enforcing restrictions on physical contact. Some insist that hugging clogs up hallways between classes. Others see absolute touching bans as an easy way to spare teachers from having to police sexual behaviour, especially with older students. It’s easy to understand why this sort of behaviour might make school staff uncomfortable, especially in the case of one school, which had “girls running down hallways to hug, squealing all the way.” However, the responses adopted so far don’t seem well thought out.,Trying to restrict physical contact simply raises other questions: is it appropriate to hug a crying friend? Outright bans get rid of these questions, but present teachers with an exhausting number of potential issues to address on a daily basis—distracting their time and energy from the business of teaching. Aside from these rules being ineffective, some teachers would likely lose interest in constantly policing behaviour they could simply ignore. This would encourage students to further flaunt school policies.,Children of all ages like to find ways of getting around rules, especially those they don’t like. In 2008, students at an Arizona high school staged an extended “hug-a-thon” as a form of protest against physical contact restrictions. One student at a New England high school has begun a petition, rightly pointing out that “interpersonal touch is not inherently sexual.”,Schools exist not only to teach students skills, but also how to function outside the structure of a classroom. One of the realities of the public sphere is the ability to recognize what qualifies as appropriate and inappropriate physical contact.,Schools need to have absolute rules about touching with sexual connotations, but should probably make less intimate contact subject to “soft policies,” which can be enforced on a discretionary basis. This would allow instructors to correct inappropriate behaviour, without giving them a second full-time job."},{"title":"Waste less, go tray-less","url":"/story/2011-01-28/editorials/waste-less-go-tray-less/","date":"January 28, 2011","content":"A pilot project by the Main Campus Residence Council’s Green Team made students eating at the West Campus cafeteria practice tray-less dining one day a week in an effort to reduce waste and energy consumption on campus.,The project began as a response to concerns about food waste in campus cafeterias. Every 1,000 meals served tray-less saves roughly 2,000 gallons of water, with an equivalent energy savings between 1.8 to 4.4 cents per tray. Student response to the project seemed largely hostile, with students complaining about the restrictions tray-less dining places on those who are trying to dine quickly.,The reasoning behind the tray-less dining plan is sound, as it obliges students to make careful decisions about which food to chose, and limits their ability to carry multiple plates—some of which might go uneaten.,However, the underlying causes of cafeteria food waste indicate that other avenues should be pursued to cut back on wasteful consumption as well.,Tray-less dining isn’t inconvenient because it forces students to make multiple trips for food, but instead because it forces them to wait in multiple lines.,Faster service times would discourage students from feeling pressured to load up on several meal options at once.,Uncertain food quality also encourages students to take more than they can eat, reasoning that at least one or two dishes won’t be as appetizing as they look.,Ensuring that food options are of consistent quality would help students have a little more faith in eating one plate of food, not half-eating several. This includes ensuring more healthy options are available to students.,It’s also important to consider the contribution that a buffet-style cafeteria makes to food waste. Other universities use a limited meal plan, where students are charged a meal for a pre-set amount of food.,While this approach doesn’t accommodate those who may have especially large or small appetites, it helps ensure that meal sizes are consistent and that less food goes unconsumed.,Tray-less dining is a good idea on its own; properly applied, it could be even better."},{"title":"Team CES for AMS","url":"/story/2011-02-01/editorials/team-ces-ams/","date":"February 1, 2011","content":"After extensive discussion with both teams in the AMS executive 2011-12 race, the editorial board of the Journal has chosen to endorse Morgan Campbell, Ashley Eagan and Kieran Slobodin.,The editorial board voted 16-0 in favour of Team CES, with three abstentions.,With the exception of Morgan Campbell, candidates from both teams manage AMS services, commissions or committees. All candidates demonstrated an impressive knowledge of the financial operations of the portfolios for which they are currently responsible.,Both teams presented interesting and varied platforms addressing a variety of campus issues. However, the platform presented by CES appeared to be supported by a greater quality and quantity of background research.,It’s hard to deny that team SDL is friendly and approachable. Of particular note is vice-president (Operations) candidate Dan Szczepanek, who consistently provided detailed and sound answers, and demonstrated an impressive grasp of the issues involved in this election—particularly for someone with little internal AMS experience.,However, it’s hard to be certain how Team SDL’s approachability will translate into an official capacity—the professionalism and preparation demonstrated by team CES gave them a clear edge.,The candidates from Team CES have excellent credentials to assume the executive positions they’re pursuing.,Vice-president (University Affairs) candidate Kieran Slobodin is the strongest candidate in this election due to his extensive experience within the administration and the AMS, his work lobbying for OUSA fees this year and his understanding of a extensive range of issues facing students—issues both directly related and ancillary to the position he is seeking.,President and CEO candidate Morgan Campbell’s role as a student trustee makes her an excellent candidate, due to her understanding of the day-to-day operations of the University and her multitude of connections throughout the University’s administration.,Some expressed concern over vice-president (Operations) candidate Ashley Eagan’s familiarity with the specific workings of the AMS. Given Eagan’s position as Retail Services Director some were confused by CES’s shortage of platform points relating to existing retail and food services.,However, the steep learning curve associated with the operations position means that a great deal of this knowledge is gleaned through hands-on and transitional experience.,Both SDL and CES emphasized the need for a more accessible and visible AMS. Each team stressed the importance of trying to emulate the relationship between students in small faculties with their faculty societies.,However, Team SDL’s “South of Union” strategy seems misguided. While the plan to increase the visibility of the AMS around campus is commendable, it might have a counter-productive effect.,Conducting scheduled open office hours at a rotating location around campus seems like a gamble, and it will only trade approachability for accessibility. The plan will also take the executives away from where most students expect to find them—in their offices.,Each candidate team addressed the financial concerns facing Alfie’s, which is experiencing a downward trend in attendance.,CES pointed to lowered liquor sales revenue and suggested the solution lies in pushing special event nights, like Classic Rock Saturdays—a consistently popular event.,SDL emphasized unexpected costs related to Student Constable licensing, an increased minimum wage and possible drug use at Alfie’s driving down liquor sales.,However, SDL’s proposed birthday line-skip program doesn’t seem likely to mitigate these issues, and could cause problems for event security and access. Allowing for the appropriate number of line-skips in a night could be a management nightmare.,The idea has generated criticism from current hospitality staff—criticism SDL is aware of, but which the team doesn’t appear too concerned about.,Throughout discussion, both teams did an excellent job relating platform points to their skills and abilities. However, candidates from Team CES tended to show a better appreciation of the distinction between big- and small-picture perspectives, while SDL focused on personal experiences. CES also demonstrated a clearer understanding of the timeframe for implementing their platform in a long-term sense.,Ultimately, Team CES was clearer and more confidence-inspiring—both in terms of their candidates and platform points. Their approach was consistently on point and showed a strong degree of preparation for the challenges of assuming the role of AMS executive.,The Journal feels that students’ votes are most effectively cast in support of Team CES."},{"title":"Go Ricky","url":"/story/2011-01-21/editorials/go-ricky/","date":"January 21, 2011","content":"Celebrities are stupid, stupid people.

Out of these myriad expressions there is one that I hate above all others: “why me?”,As in, “This is so terrible; why did it happen to me?” or “that car could’ve hit anyone; why me?”,These phrases feel like poison in my ears—what they really mean is “this should’ve happened to someone else.” We are both instinctually wired and culturally acclimatized to revile whatever hurts us, and many of us would don the hedonistic belief that pleasure is life’s greatest calling.,It’s this mindset that convinces us not to work hard and resist temptation, and so our country has an obesity problem. This same mindset fuels our inability to delay pleasure, making us think, “I see it, I want it,” and so our continent is mired in debt.,This should not be the case.,Life is suffering, and life isn’t over any time soon, so it’s time to change the approach. Every opportunity to suffer is an opportunity to be great, and to showcase your moral fortitude and humanity.,When tragedy touches your life, don’t wring your hands and mourn your lot—accept it, embrace it.,When the opportunity comes to say “why did this happen to me,” say “thank goodness this happened to me and not someone else.” The errant spark that burns your house down is the same that could have destroyed your neighbor’s home.,Kahlil Gibran said that “pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding,” and by looking through this lens, we gain a new perspective on our tribulations. Think of them instead as growing pains: a necessary part of your evolution into a mature and fully formed creature.,It is heartbreak and sorrow that carves us into our optimal shape—steel gets its strength from being tempered in fire.,I’m mixing my metaphors, but I think you get the idea.,When grief or unhappiness surprises you, confront it. Fleeing from or burying it away is to miss a chance to become something better.,So please, never ever say “why did it have to be me,” because when you let slip those few words, you’re speaking countless volumes about who you are on a basic level, and it doesn’t sound very good at all.,If you can’t think of something constructive to say, then say nothing.

Chua is a professor of law at Yale, and her book shares some of the parenting techniques she used in raising her two “phenomenally accomplished” daughters, Sophia and Lulu.,Chua is critical of childrearing as an activity oriented around self-esteem and self-exploration. Instead, she emphasizes repetition, criticism and exacting standards. Her children were denied the sorts of childhood experiences that many take for granted, including play dates and sleepovers. The children weren’t allowed to get anything below an A in school—with the exception of gym and drama—nor were they allowed to learn any instrument besides the piano or violin. An excerpt from Chua’s book published last week in The Wall Street Journal drew considerable public attention, both positive and negative. Some have denounced Chua’s tactics as cruel, while others have charged her with contributing to Asian stereotyping and encouraging discrimination.,Though Chua succeeded in raising two very talented children, one of whom has played in Carnegie Hall, it’s nearly impossible to condone the methods she used.,Chua insists that “nothing is fun until you’re good at it,” and explains that “children on their own never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences.” While it’s reasonable to push your children to succeed—for their own sake and out of personal pride—forcing them to excel at everything, and limiting their areas of interest is simply unreasonable. Academic success has perceptible benefits, but there’s little purpose to excelling at everything when you don’t enjoy any of it.,Denying children social outlets won’t do them any favours, as developing social skills is important for success in adulthood. It’s much more reasonable to teach children the importance of hard work and diligence, and encourage them to work at their homework—while ensuring that they spent with their friends.,It’s simply common sense that placing an expectation of perfection on your children will put them in a no-win situation. Most children won’t be able to keep up with this standard, regardless of how much time and energy they apply. Passion and independent discovery will lead to pursuing genuine interests; forced pratice will not.,Ultimately, people are free to raise their children as they see fit, and no one wants their children to fail. But striving for success can sometimes reach too far."},{"title":"Four Loko is too much","url":"/story/2010-12-02/editorials/four-loko-too-much/","date":"December 2, 2010","content":"New Jersey’s Ramapo College has banned a popular canned beverage in light of serious concerns about the safety of its students. The drink is called Four Loko, and contains alcohol and a host of energy drink ingredients. Not only does it come in large, 700 ml cans, but it’s cheap and fruit-flavoured as well. These factors make it popular with those on a tight budget and those who don’t like the harsh taste of more traditional drinks.,Ramapo College instituted the ban on Oct. 1, after more than 20 students were hospitalized in binge-drinking incidents. Other institutions have followed the college’s lead, and many more have informed their students about the dangers posed by alcoholic energy drinks, particularly Four Loko.,Ramapo College President Peter Mercer was quoted as saying that the beverage serves “no redeeming social purpose.” It’s hard to disagree with him—just as it’s hard to imagine someone drinking Four Loko for any reason other than quick intoxication.,It’s unlikely that the college will be able to effectively enforce such a ban. However, efforts to make the drink less available aren’t limited to the administrative level. In response to concerns about overconsumption, several states are moving to ban alcoholic energy drinks outright, and many retailers have voluntarily pulled the product from shelves.,Though it’s a good idea to make potentially dangerous beverages less available, the ban is targeting a symptom, not the problem itself. Young people—especially students—are fond of risky methods of drinking. Recipes for a do-it-yourself equivalent of Four Loko are available online, and less-motivated people can simply mix an alcohol-free energy drink with their beverage of choice.,It’s important to note that the issues stemming from Four Loko aren’t simply the consequence of an unsafe product getting into the wrong hands."},{"title":"Learning to listen","url":"/story/2010-10-29/editorials/learning-listen/","date":"October 29, 2010","content":"A Features piece published in the Oct. 26 issue of the Journal considered communication problems within the classroom. The article focused on the resources available to instructors who have difficulty communicating with students, including courses offered to English as a Second Language (ESL) teaching staff. The article also captured both student and faculty perspectives on communication barriers in teaching.,A communication barrier, affects both the student and the instructor, and poses challenges each side must be willing to tackle. This applies to any communication issue, whether it be an accent, a quiet voice or a tendency to speed through material.,Instructors must acknowledge that communication issues can complicate the learning process, and be prepared to repeat material, or explain material in a different way. Their teaching style should emphasize the communication of key points via visual representations. Furthermore, instructors need to let students know that they are open to feedback surrounding these issues.,This is in no way a commentary on the intelligence or qualifications of any instructor. A willingness to facilitate learning applies regardless of whether or not an instructor has difficulty communicating with students. Instructors at all levels and from all backgrounds should work to improve their ability to teach. However, the responsibility is not on the shoulders of the instructor alone.,Communication issues can present real obstacles to students, impairing learning or forcing them to drop out of an important course. But simply giving up because an instructor is difficult to understand is purely an act of laziness.,Just as instructors need to be open to improving their teaching, students need to make an effort to facilitate their own learning. International Vice-Provost John Dixon does well to point out the reality of this scenario, stating that this skill is a realistic part of “engagement with diverse people in the world.”,Instructors and students alike need to acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of the University Survey of Student Assessment of Teaching (USAT), the primary method of student feedback. While an instructor who relies on the USATs alone to inform their teaching style is short-changing the students they teach, students who fail to complete these forms diligently are depriving the instructor of constructive feedback. A personal attack on an instructor in a USAT evaluation doesn’t help them improve.,Ultimately, the solution to communication problems is more communication."},{"title":"Tropic of illness","url":"/story/2010-11-09/editorials/tropic-illness/","date":"November 9, 2010","content":"An article published Nov. 7 in the Observer quotes an unexpected claim being made by some experts in the scientific community. According to Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Professor David Molyneux, ailments like HIV, malaria and TB monopolize medical resources in developing countries.,Focusing on these “high-profile” conditions means more common ailments like sleeping sickness, elephantiasis and river blindness go unaddressed. According to Molyneux, the problem has nothing to do with greedy pharmaceutical companies, but stems from policy makers focusing on familiar medical problems.,It’s certainly true that conditions like HIV and malaria are more high-profile than trachoma and bilharzia. However, it’s difficult to decide how to strike a balance between aiding the greatest number of individuals, and aiding those who are most seriously affected—many of the neglected conditions are not fatal, but severely debilitating.,The publication of this sort of discourse is problematic, because it has the unintended effect of suggesting that some conditions aren’t as serious as others—further hampering aid groups trying to raise awareness about a particular condition or crisis.,For every expert who claims that a particular disease is the most problematic, there will be other experts ready to disagree. Furthermore, assessing the ease of addressing a particular condition isn’t simply a question of medicine; it’s also a question of infrastructure. Tackling neglected tropical disorders may require a different set of measures than those that are currently in place.,Even if some kind of medical consensus were to arise, this would hardly be the end of the problem. Many of the resources in question are funded by grants, charities and government agencies, which aren’t likely to pull money from one cause to address another “neglected” cause.,The medical and scientific communities are comprised of experts. By addressing an uninformed audience, this statement polarizes public opinion.

DiManno suggests that because women’s hockey lacks the competitive ferocity that makes men’s hockey so popular, male sports will always have a greater public draw.,There’s nothing wrong with acknowledging a “pioneering spirit,” but DiManno insists that this has to do with cultural standards, not athletics. She concludes that the best area for women to compete with men is in the role of franchise owner, executive or maybe one day as coach.,Comparing the skill levels of two different hockey players is never an entirely objective process, and it’s usually a source of controversy.,By repeatedly stressing the differences between men’s and women’s hockey, DiManno simply weakens her own argument. If the two types of competition are wholly different, why can’t the players of each side be acknowledged as sharing a common game? The venue in question is the Hockey Hall of Fame, not the Men’s Hockey Hall of Fame—male and female players deserve equal acknowledgement.,Women’s hockey is relatively new on the international stage. DiManno overlooks the struggle that women have faced as athletes playing what she calls a “man’s game, feminized.” These challenges are intrinsic to the struggle to legitimize a less popular sport.,Insisting that women can only be inducted as pioneers of a less popular and less visible sport than their male counterparts is demeaning. Furthermore, it implies that the only reason women play hockey is to accomplish exactly that kind of gender barrier smashing that DiManno is so quick to condemn. Having role models in the Hall of Fame to look up to is a vital part of athletic competition.,It may be true that women’s hockey draws a relatively small audience compared to the male equivalent.

Some common strategies target students who aren’t likely to bully anyway. Others don’t consider the type of bullying in question, and thus fail to address situations effectively. School administrators,tend to use measures that sound good, failing to take into account up-to-date strategies and research.,While it’s important to acknowledge that bullying will never disappear completely, it’s crucial that schools take appropriate action. While bullies sometimes “grow out of” their behaviour, the consequences for their targets can be long-lasting and serious—consider the recent wave of suicides in the US motivated by homophobic bullying.,Administrators must adopt a strategy that emphasizes that bullying behaviour is unacceptable, not something to be laughed at. This behaviour is a form of abuse and should be taken seriously. When children are aware that bullying is taken seriously, they will be less likely to engage in bullying behaviour.,This also helps overcome one of the major obstacles of targeting bullying behaviour: getting students to report it. Children who don’t report bullying promptly can’t benefit from the support a school environment is supposed to offer.,Administrators also need to be clear about what constitutes bullying, as much for students’ benefit as their own. School officials need to recognize that bullying can range from physical attacks to taunting and rumours, and be prepared to deal with each incident as it arises. Schools should also try and provide outlets for students that discourage scenarios where bullying could arise. Providing areas where students can spend recess and lunch periods without being isolated by their peers helps insulate them from hostile behaviour.,School administrators also need to be ready to tackle problems outside of the school environment. Bullying often continues outside of school property, and teachers need to make it clear to students that they have the authority to deal with problems that happen outside of the classroom."},{"title":"Alcohol not all bad","url":"/story/2010-11-05/editorials/alcohol-not-all-bad/","date":"November 5, 2010","content":"An article published Nov. 1 by the Toronto Star summarized a medical study with a controversial conclusion.,The study graded the danger of legal and illegal drugs on a 16-point scale, taking into account the effect of each drug on both the user and others.,The study found that alcohol is a more dangerous drug than heroin, crack and other illegal drugs. David Nutt, the psychiatrist and neuropyschopharmacologist behind the study, cites the results as evidence that governments need to reconsider waging war against hard drugs.,Nutt was fired from his position as chair of the United Kingdom’s Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs after repeatedly clashing with the government’s rigid stance on illegal drugs.,His perspective is endorsed by Dr. Jurgen Rehm, a scientist at Toronto’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Rehm suggests the solution may lie in hiking alcohol taxes and limiting alcohol advertising, which often entices minors. The article was published on healthzone.ca, the Star’s online health supplement.,It’s difficult to reconcile the conclusion of Nutt’s study. Most people drink alcohol without serious side-effects; this cannot be said of people who smoke crack.,Alcohol can be dangerous, but measuring it alongside hard drugs feels like a comparison of issues that differ greatly in severity.,It’s important to note that Nutt’s study was published in The Lancet, one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world. It’s quite likely that his conclusions are valid within the framework and analysis he conducted.,The real problem with grasping Nutt’s study lies in how it is described in the Star’s article. The article provides a simplistic summary of the framework Nutt used to arrive at his conclusion, which is helpful for a non-expert audience. However, the Star article doesn’t connect the dots, focusing heavily on Nutt’s conclusion: the numerical “harm” number assigned to each drug.,While it’s easy to find Nutt’s study online, it’s difficult to sift through the technical jargon and detail. It would have been of great benefit to the reader if the Star had addressed a complex topic in more detail.,The study arrived at its conclusion based on the fact that because alcohol is so wide-spread, the issues it raises create a greater burden on the average taxpayer than illegal drugs.

While her partner was convicted of sexual assault, a court of appeal ruled that the woman had consented and overturned the conviction.,There are compelling arguments for the case on both sides. Some have argued that the ability to consent to an activity must include the freedom to withdraw consent at any time, which is impossible in a state of unconsciousness. If advanced consent is codified into law, some are concerned it could become a legal defence in cases of sexual assault.,Others suggest that the ability to relinquish the right to consent is a crucial component of an individual’s right to determine what they do with their own body.,Creating a law prohibiting this kind of behaviour will inevitably raise far more questions than it will help resolve. One Supreme Court justice questioned whether or not an individual who kisses a sleeping partner could be charged with assault. It’s a silly example, but it illustrates the essential difficulty of negotiating this concern: defining what someone can consent to while unconcious.,The problem with criminalizing this activity is that it’s essentially impossible to regulate, and thus won’t simplify any existing problems facing cases of sexual violence. Two individuals who engage in this activity consensually and without adverse consequences will never have cause to enter the legal system in the first place.,If two consenting adults wish to participate in a sexual activity and do so without concerns of wrong-doing, no one has been injured."},{"title":"The terror of tourism","url":"/story/2010-11-26/editorials/terror-tourism/","date":"November 26, 2010","content":"A report published by the Human Sciences Research Council puts an unpleasant spin on foreign visits driven by good intentions, otherwise known as “voluntourism.”,While many believe that travelling abroad marks an opportunity to do some good, the report indicates that organizations may be feeding a market which capitalizes on the poverty of others.,Some tour agencies allow travellers to visit orphanages or pay to distribute food, reducing the children to a spectacle to be observed and pitied. Orphanages will often allow tourists to work with children, a safety risk that most would never condone at home. In addition, some groups have indicated that these visits have serious emotional consequences for the children in question, who form attachments to foreign visitors very quickly. Little of the profit generated by tourist vists is spent feeding and sheltering the children, who are often abused into the bargain.,Other forms of volunteering come with invisible costs to less-fortunate populations. Paying to work abroad for a brief period of time robs local workers of viable sources of income, and the money spent is rarely directed to improving the local community. Similarly, the time and energy put into housing these visitors could be better spent elsewhere.,Sometimes a little bit of help is better than none, but that reasoning doesn’t seem to apply here. Charity isn’t charity when the money doesn’t help someone in need. This doesn’t mean that we should condemn volunteering abroad wholesale, but instead look for productive and effective ways to contribute our time and energy.,Individuals looking to volunteer should conduct critical research into the activities that they will be conducting. Not all organizations conducting charitable activities are actually charities.,It’s also important to make sure that you aren’t simply writing a cheque for a feel-good experience. Volunteering is about helping others, not about your self-concept. As well, would-be volunteers should make sure that they’re addressing a serious issue, not a hot-topic trumped up by a celebrity or the media.,Volunteers should take time to recognize the value of contributing time and energy at home, where one can see the positive effects of charitable contribution clearly, and be more directly engaged.,It’s important that money-making schemes don’t supplant legitimate cases of need."},{"title":"Truant?

Students who skip class miss out on new material and instruction, which often can’t be regained by copying notes or last-minute cramming.,Falling behind discourages a student from attending future classes, especially in an already difficult or dry subject. It’s also disrespectful to the instructor of a course.,While some students are able to teach themselves unfamiliar material, this sort of high-risk approach doesn’t work for the majority. Keeping students in the classroom is absolutely vital.,At the same time, a truancy cap needs to be properly instituted. Though this sort of structure is important for younger students, older students need to take some initiative and responsibility. Over-supervising students about to enter adult life doesn’t teach them about the consequences of absentee behaviour.,It’s also important that educators recognize that persistent truancy isn’t necessarily a sign of laziness. Though the average student at any level misses the occasional class, some students may find the learning environment counter-productive for a number of reasons. These students need additional support, not just a motivation to sit in a chair.,This punishment won’t resolve truancy entirely.

The book is based on interviews conducted between the Pope and a German journalist. In the quoted interview, the Pope stated that he believes that condom usage may be appropriate for male prostitutes, as an indicator of a “first step” of moral responsibility.,Benedict drew considerable fire for downplaying the usefulness of condoms in preventing the spread of AIDS while visiting Africa in 2009. The move towards the acceptance of condoms marks a clear departure from Pope Benedict’s perspective as stated previously.,Officially, the Catholic Church opposes the usage of any contraceptive method, including condoms. The Vatican was quick to insist that the Pope is not adjusting existing doctrine.,It’s difficult to determine the exact significance of the Pope’s statement. While it’s encouraging to see the Church approaching contemporary issues from a more contemporary perspective, some insist that the Pope’s words were too vague.,It’s tempting to criticize the incompatibility of the Church’s stance on homosexual relationships with their acceptance of condom use in this case. However, a sweeping reversal of Catholic beliefs is an unreasonable expectation.,A statement like this will at least prompt discussion in religious circles. The Church has long been subjected to quiet pressure to loosen their opposition against condoms—pressure coming from inside and outside the church. Approving of condoms for male prostitutes, even in an unofficial capacity, will likely help those struggling to negotiate faith and contraception.,While the Pope’s statement may not have been a categorical endorsement of condom usage, it represents a move towards a more inclusive and proactive understanding of contraception.,Hopefully it isn’t the last move the Church is willing to make."},{"title":"Just one for the road","url":"/story/2010-11-12/editorials/just-one-road/","date":"November 12, 2010","content":"The government of British Columbia is planning an advertising campaign letting people know that it’s ok to drink and drive—a little bit.,The move comes in response to aggressive drunk driving measures the province enacted in September. The measures allow police to apply a three-day driving ban on individuals caught in the “warning zone” with a blood-alcohol content (BAC) between .05 and .08. Drivers who exceed .08 can face a 90-day driving ban and 30-day car impoundment.,Most of the complaints about the new measures have come from the public and the hospitality industry. The latter has a faced a 15 to 30 per cent drop in business since the provincial government enacted aggressive penalties in September.,Drunk driving kills 130 British Columbians a year. While police claim the new restrictions have played a large part in reducing drunk driving, the Solicitor-General, Rich Coleman, pointed out that no hard statistics support this conclusion, and suggested that police have been too quick to exercise their ability to impound cars.,Coleman is concerned that individuals have the mistaken impression that they can’t have a drink with dinner and drive home within the law.,While plenty of drivers are able to safely operate a car after one or two drinks, there’s no reason for the government to encourage drinking and driving. Placing emphasis on the “safe” BAC needed to drive is problematic, because it’s not easy to assess qualitatively. People with certain body types and tolerances probably shouldn’t be driving after even a few drinks—BAC aside.,If drunk-driving measures are having a direct effect on restaurants and bars, which hasn’t yet been proven, these businesses should look to proactive measures that will allow patrons to drink without exposing others to possible harm.,Partnering with taxi companies for a discounted fare would allow restaurants to provide a safe alternative to driving home in fear of getting pulled over.,As long as people continue to drink and drive, the government isn’t doing enough to combat drunk driving.

Weaving through a sea of clever dress and miles of exposed skin, my friends and I stopped to speak with Karl Marx and a seemingly uncooperative friend. Holding the Communist Manifesto and sporting a lengthy beard, we guessed the famed philosopher right away. Giving in and breaking the ice, I asked his friend—dressed in a black sweater and blue jeans—what he was supposed to be.,Casually he responded, “I’m myself. Aren’t we all liars anyway?” I started thinking. Then I got scared.,This morning I told my housemate someone else drank her milk. Last night I didn’t accidentally spill cranberry juice on Snow White’s petticoat. I’m a liar, I’m a denier, I’m a midnight falsifier. I don’t think Karl Marx’s friend was speaking about the white lie pandemic that fueled my internal crisis. I think he was talking about denial. Like dressing up, denial is a form of lying, but the costume we wear is for our own peace of mind, not the entertainment of others.,While Halloween flips self-denial outward, allowing folks to be whomever they’d like for a night, it certainly isn’t the only time we do this. Anybody can wake up in the morning and decide to act as another.,I believe denial is healthy. Anna Freud’s research into denial dubbed it a defence mechanism, used to safeguard the human psyche from damaging thought.

The piece focuses on concerns within the academic community about the implications of a university gaining—as one student put it—a “reputation of being Asian.”,The article cites claims that Asian students are more likely to apply themselves to academics, while white students are more likely to emphasize social interaction, extracurriculars and alcohol. Some administrators fear that having an “Asian” reputation will alienate non-Asian applicants.,The question of being “too Asian” is a high-profile concern in the US, where universities are often accused of arbitrarily controlling the ethnic makeup of their student body—accusations supported by scientific studies. The article suggests that Canadian universities face a difficult problem. Because these institutions operate as meritocracies, racial identity shouldn’t influence one’s ability to be a successful applicant. However, universities must choose between acknowledging the presence of these stereotypes—and risk being labelled as discriminatory—or avoid acknowledging them altogether.,The piece has become the target of a substantial amount of hostility, as many have suggested it merely perpetuates racial stereotypes. Because many of the interviewees are citing individual experiences, the article appears to be a series of racially-motivated generalizations put forth as fact.,The Maclean’s article faces a significant hurdle engrained in the topic it discusses. Writing a news story about an acknowledged problem based on stereotypes and generalisations is difficult. While the piece includes a variety of quotations from students, faculty and administrators, contextualizing individual opinions is nearly impossible. No one is in a position to make a definitive statement, nor does any one individual’s opinion speak for anyone else.,Despite the numerous criticisms levelled at the Maclean’s piece, one of its most unequivocal points is also its most valid. An admissions system based on anything other than merit is discriminatory. As the Maclean’s article concludes, universities should target racial stereotyping by encouraging diversity and equity within campuses, not by artificially ensuring a ratio of some ethnicities to others.,Ultimately, an individual is free to discount attending a university based on whatever criteria are most important to him or her. If this includes concerns about a university’s “Asian” reputation, then that student is simply letting their own racism inform a highly consequential decision.,And he or she should probably think twice."},{"title":"Don’t say no to Mo’","url":"/story/2010-11-26/editorials/dont-say-no-mo/","date":"November 26, 2010","content":"A new trend in men’s style has erupted on campus in recent weeks.

To do this, they have subjected themselves to a month of ridicule and judgement from strangers, their families and their closest friends.,I donated on the condition that he send me photos of what I had heard is an offensive moustache.,Movember was started by a group of friends in 2003 at a pub in Australia, and has since become an international phenomenon. Millions of dollars have been collected for charities, and global awareness about prostate cancer is on the rise. After all, it’s tough to ignore the statement of support plastered across the faces of your male friends. The rules of Movember are simple. One must have a completely hair-free upper lip on Oct. 31, dubbed “Shadowe’en,” and grow a moustache without other facial hair over a four week period. Thankfully, joining moustaches with sideburns is strictly prohibited.,Movember activities escalate each year. Thirty men took part in the first official Movember seven years ago, and today the number has climbed to almost 2,000,000. According to Movember Canada, over 115,000 Canadians have raised almost $13 million this month.,Men are now finding unique ways to increase their fundraising potential by doing things like keeping the moustache for an extra month.,Another new trend for Movember is the participation of all sexes. Most recently I was invited to participate in the Nov. 16 “Have sex with a guy with a moustache day.” Men, I am not sure whether that additional facial hair is hurting or helping your game, but I am glad that the moustache has become the new signature of support for men’s health.,I hope that in years to come, men sporting moustaches in November will be a pleasant reminder to think about important health issues but also, for men to see their physicians for screening and health risk reduction measures in general.,As Movember 2010 comes to a close, I offer my congratulations to those who stuck it out. If you grew a silky smooth moustache worthy of Tom Selleck or Ron Burgundy, I applaud you.,For those of you who could only manage patchy, fuzzy upper-lips, don’t worry.,There’s always next Movember."},{"title":"Costs don’t add up","url":"/story/2010-11-02/editorials/costs-dont-add/","date":"November 2, 2010","content":"While I sit at my desk writing this editorial on a Friday night, it has become painfully obvious to me that people have unrealistic expectations for students. A lot of people I know are working 40 hours a week trying to pay for tuition while they’re enrolled in a full course load.,Others are accumulating so much debt that the value of their university degree is becoming increasingly questionable as the years go by. Some are lucky enough to have wealthy parents who can pay for their education. But for the rest of us, it’s a tough obstacle to overcome.,Tuition costs often influence academic performance at school because the time students spend at work is time they don’t have to study or go to class. They end up skipping classes to work in restaurants and retail stores to finance their education. Then professors are surprised when students don’t do their readings every week, and students are disappointed because they can’t achieve the perfect scores they had in high school. How does that make any sense?,When you think about it, tuition is an unfair thing to ask from someone straight out of high school, who hasn’t had the opportunity to make money yet. It’s basically cornering people in need of a service and putting them in debt before they even have a chance. Educating people shouldn’t be a business. It should be free for anyone who is sincerely interested in it.,Let’s face the facts. Not everyone who goes to university actually wants to be there and tons of people who aren’t attending really wish they could, but don’t have the means to do so. It’s unfair that universities let financial backgrounds take precedence over the hard work students put into school.,I have a friend who works one semester and studies every other semester. We graduated from high school at the same time. I’m in my fourth year and he’s still in his second year. I admire his dedication. But I can’t help but be angry that his education presents such a financial stress that he needs to interrupt his learning to finance his way through. At this rate he’ll be out of his mom’s basement by 25—at the earliest.,In some countries like Scotland and France, tuition costs are largely subsidized by the government. An average Scottish student’s tuition varies from $0 up to $2,000 depending on parental income. However, in the US, tuition costs can range up to a whopping $60,000 per year. I don’t understand how tuition could cost so much when some places are capable of making it accessible for everyone. Where is the tuition money going anyway? I don’t feel like it’s always targeted towards things I agree with.,Personally, I could do without the abundance of plasma TVs in the ARC. Most people aren’t watching them and there are always 3 or 4 on the same channel. Is that necessary? I mean, it’s not a Future Shop, it’s a freaking gym. Meanwhile, budget cuts are restricting the classes we can take, and students are working too hard to pass."},{"title":"Online in the real world","url":"/story/2010-10-29/editorials/online-real-world/","date":"October 29, 2010","content":"Right now, my best friend is tucked into the corner of a Starbucks in Vancouver sipping a pumpkin spice latte with whipped cream.,How do I know this moderately creepy tidbit?

I have a reputation as a bookworm, but my mother knew to cross that off of my list.,The Kindle became available in Canada about a year ago. It’s an e-book reader: a piece of technology that’s no bigger than a book itself, with a screen that displays the text of a novel, magazine or newspaper.,I’m not bothered by other people wanting a Kindle, because I understand that it has practical value. But why is there a need for practicality when it comes to glorious books, when a few pages of text bring such comfort to me and make me feel so much smarter.,Books take up space, wear with age, and buying new ones inevitably means leaving the house. The Kindle is turning books into a high-tech pastime, where you have to download stories and stare at a single computer screen to read a novel. But this is what I don’t understand—how do people get enjoyment out of these things?,My childhood was spent staring at bookcases at the library, at the bookstore, at my house. Shelves of books that made up a rainbow of colours with fancy fonts and authors’ names that sounded exotic to an eight-year old.,I still remember the words of Goodnight Moon, and I Love You Forever still brings tears to my eyes.,The experience of opening a book for the first time is like no other. The crack of the spine, the smoothing of the pages, the crisp black text and the first folded page that acts as a bookmark. And don’t even get me started on that new book smell.,Books bring people together. As you sit on the bus or in-between classes reading a novel, someone recognizes the title and stops to chat with you. They declare their love for Little Women or ask you if you really think Wuthering Heights is as romantic as some perceive it to be.,That’s not possible with the Kindle, which has no front cover to recognize, or a title to indicate which fantasy world you’re immersed in. Even worse is that the Kindle cannot show the same physical declaration of use that a well loved book can. There isn’t the broken-in spine, the dog eared pages or even the strange stains that slowly accumulate on the pages over the years. Instead, the Kindle just has ugly scratch marks and dents that hint towards carelessness—and a need for a new edition instead of a much adored book.,This is not a complaint about technology, but a celebration of a childhood love that has become a central part of my adult life.

Moore suffers from partial blindness, deafness and severe memory loss.,However, none of these difficulties prevented her from voting in the recent Toronto municipal election. Moore lives in a long-term care facility that hosted a polling station with officials on hand to aid voters who need assistance through the voting process. Moore was unfamiliar with the candidates in the municipal election. She chose one at random, and cannot remember who she voted for. The Star captured the concern of Moore’s daughter-in-law, who said she’s concerned that Moore may have been manipulated.,While this concern is plausible, the public has to have some faith in the scruples of the average electoral employee. It’s more reasonable to worry about Moore’s ability to make an informed decision than the possibility of a corrupt official.,It’s unsettling that Moore’s impairments may have prevented her from making an informed decision, but it’s a reflection of one of the practical limitations of any electoral system. While individuals should educate themselves as carefully as possible in order to make an informed decision, they aren’t obliged to do so. Many people vote from an uninformed—or mistaken—perspective.,The only practical solution to avoiding uninformed voting would involve some kind of aptitude test, where voters prove their ability to make an informed decision by indicating familiarity with various platform issues.,Not only would such a process be costly and time-consuming, it would also be undemocratic. The Star article includes an interview with a political science professor who stresses that every person has the right to vote, regardless of state of mind.

Several English universities are trialling two-year fast-track degree programs. This follows a Staffordshire University study that concluded that students taking a two-year course track ended up with significantly less debt over time.,Many suggest that this new academic option will help students who are strapped for cash, or those who are looking to get into the job market as quickly as possible. But not everyone has jumped on board, including a lecturers’ union which has branded fast-track programs as “academic sweatshops.” Others suggest that fast-tracking will impair the quality of education, or deprive students of a valuable opportunity for personal development.,It’s praiseworthy that universities want to offer an education that accommodates an individual’s schedule and budget, but many of the concerns surrounding this proposal seem well-founded. While a fast-track program doesn’t necessarily impair the quality of an education, there is a risk of fast-tracking being seen as less challenging or less worthy. Potential employers might develop an unspoken bias—especially those educated in the traditional format.,Fast-track programs might also turn out to be less flexible than intended. Students in a shorter program wouldn’t be able to adjust their areas of study as easily as those pursuing a multi-year degree. In some cases, a fast-track course could lock students into a path that they end up regretting.,Though it’s true that a university degree allows students to learn about themselves and undergo personal development, it’s important to keep in mind that much of this development can take place outside of an academic community.,However, students in a two-year program won’t have as much time to draw on a university’s range of extra-curricular activities. This is not only a great way to discover new interests and develop new skills; it’s also a key part of applying to graduate level studies and other forms of higher education.,It’s unclear exactly how these issues will apply to university education in the long-run, but the first goal of enrolling at a university is to receive a quality education.

His plan also involves granting anonymity to teachers accused of misconduct while inquiries are undertaken.,He said that existing guidelines on classroom management are too dense to be of practical value, and should be simplified.,Gove’s comments have drawn fire from the Children’s Rights Alliance, which claims the move threatens human rights and child protection laws.,While it’s important that teachers understand that this does not give them the right to physically reprimand students—something Gove addressed directly—it’s pretty clear that this is a realistic take on the responsibilities that teachers are entrusted with.,Teachers must have the ability to separate students physically to prevent injury. Children don’t always listen to verbal instructions. In the event of physical altercations, a teacher trying to defuse a situation without intervening physically could quickly result in a child being injured.,Comforting small children with a hug is equally important.,A transparent and highly visible set of rules—generalized across school boards and districts—would be the ideal way to implement such a plan.

For example, providing a support network to help the military adapt to such a consequential change is absolutely vital.,In any context outside of the military, a policy like “Don’t ask, don’t tell” would be nothing more than discrimination, hardly tolerable in any society which is founded on principles of equality and mutual respect.,It’s still unclear exactly what will follow Judge Phillips’ ruling, but this decision is definitely a step in the right direction."},{"title":"Safe Exit has risks","url":"/story/2010-10-19/editorials/safe-exit-has-risks/","date":"October 19, 2010","content":"A controversial speaker held an even more controversial talk in Toronto on Wednesday.,Australian doctor Philip Nitschke led the city’s first “Safe Exit” workshop, which provides individuals with reliable and comprehensive advice on methods to end their own lives.,The workshop is aimed at helping those considering ending their lives to find methods that allow them to commit suicide without implicating others—who can face a penalty of up to 14 years in jail for assisting them.,Dr. Nitschke is the director of Exit International, an advocacy group for voluntary euthanasia based in Australia.

He charges Armstrong with hosting an orgy in his residence room in 2009 and attempting to inculcate other student government figures and first-year students into “the homosexual lifestyle.” Shrivell has defended his actions by insisting that he worked on the blog in his personal time, but this doesn’t excuse the fact that his criticism of Armstrong focuses almost entirely on Armstrong’s personal life.,Shirvell has also admitted to protesting outside of Armstrong’s house.,Homophobia may not be illegal, but discrimination certainly is. While Shirvell may claim he’s exercising his First Amendment rights, there’s a difference between freedom of speech and libel.

Prostitution itself is not illegal, but practically every action involved with it is.,Judge Himel’s decision overturned three major sections of the prostitution law which criminalize communication for the purpose of prostitution, living off the avails of prostitution and brothel-keeping.,The challenge was launched by three female sex workers.,While some may not be pleased with the decision, it seems guided by common sense. Forcing prostitution underground doesn’t make it go away. By making prostitution less visible, we sacrifice the well-being of sex workers.,In the meantime, those who work in the sex trade face public stigma and legal repercussions that make seeking medical attention or reporting threats and violence nearly impossible.,Ensuring that sex workers can work safely has nothing to do with questions of morality, and everything to do with human rights. Brothel-keeping would allow prostitutes to screen prospective clients, and create a support network by working in a secure location.,Individuals concerned about living near a brothel should acknowledge that this is a safer—and far more subtle—alternative to street prostitution.,This decision does raise many questions, especially in the interim period while the government debates drafting new laws to combat prostitution. There are no guarantees against a new set of laws as confusing as before.,The concern put forth by the Crown—that easing or removing laws that “combat” prostitution will encourage people to pursue it as a “career choice”—are absurd.,It is likely that social stigma will always surround sex work, hardly glamorizing it.

But while this presentation won’t do away with the problem of “hockey parents,” Hockey Calgary’s decision is commendable.,It’s unsettling that parents who enrol their children in an extra-curricular sport might be driven to abusive behaviour. Making this measure mandatory for the parents or guardians of a player is a proactive attempt to combat a problem before it develops.,Hopefully, even the minor time commitment made to the RIS program will encourage parents to be more careful about their own behaviour, and more considerate of the feelings of others.

By doing so, they deny their children a chance to take part in a rewarding team activity, and waste money previously spent on equipment.,The RIS program won’t eliminate problem parents in organized sport, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction."},{"title":"Rx for disaster","url":"/story/2010-10-19/editorials/rx-disaster/","date":"October 19, 2010","content":"An article published on Oct. 15 in the Journal considered the ongoing use and abuse of prescription drugs at Queen’s.,The article focused primarily on the use of drugs meant to treat Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which are among the drugs of choice for students looking to boost productivity and concentration as the school year becomes increasingly busy.,The article also detailed the lengthy process by which an individual is assessed and prescribed these medications.,It’s tempting to blame the increasing recreational usage of these drugs on over-prescription or the growing pressures of the academic lifestyle, but it speaks more to a general ignorance of the real risks of abusing prescription medication.,People who underestimate the dangers of taking drugs that aren’t prescribed to them are simply misinformed. Because this medication is intended to address a specific problem with a specific degree of severity, taking it without being properly diagnosed by a doctor could produce no effect, or a severe reaction.,Amphetamine-based drugs come with a risk of addiction, compounded by the fact that controlling drug use isn’t always in the hands of the user. Doses are specifically tailored to an individual’s needs and watched carefully by the doctors that prescribe them.,As with any other drug, it’s important that people who enjoy abusing these drugs—and their friends—be aware of the warning signs of addiction and adverse reactions.,But beyond the possibility of physical harm, the destigmatization of this kind of drug abuse has other damaging effects. Using a drug as a quick fix for a day of cramming for an exam or an all-nighter to finish a paper marginalizes the issues it’s intended to treat.,The person giving away these drugs—whether for fun or profit—is effectively hurting themselves by refusing to properly address a serious and lifelong condition.,There’s no reason why a desire for a quick buck should lead someone to short-change themselves."},{"title":"Star eclipsed by Globe","url":"/story/2010-10-26/editorials/star-eclipsed-globe/","date":"October 26, 2010","content":"In the midst of the controversy surrounding former Canadian Forces Colonel Russell Williams, a dispute has sprung up between two major news outlets covering the case.,Photos of Williams posing in women’s lingerie stolen from his victims and home invasions have circulated in the media and online. On Oct. 19, the Globe and Mail published an explanation of its decision to limit these pictures to its online content. The Globe’s print coverage was limited to a cropped photo of Williams’ face on the cover, and a grouping of women’s undergarments presented as evidence in his case on an inside page. In contrast, the Toronto Star published the revealing photos on its front page and featured them prominently on its website.,The Globe explained that the newspaper was unwilling to force disturbing content on unsuspecting readers. Instead, they provided a great deal of written coverage about Williams’ actions, and directed readers online if they wished to see the photos.,Three days later the Star published a similar explanation. They acknowledged that overt exposure of the photos would likely upset some readers, and stated that their decision would likely hinder, not help, sales of the publication. However, in the words of the Star’s publisher, the images are “the most honest portrayal” of the story.,The Globe’s approach was not only more appropriate, but also more responsible. The Globe didn’t suppress the controversial photographs, but tried to provide its readers with the ability to make an informed decision before viewing them. While people have the ability to stop reading an unsettling article, they can’t “unsee” a photograph—a fact that the Globe’s decision took into account.,The Star’s argument that the photos are the best representation of “the evil wielded by a man of power over his female victims” doesn’t add up. The reality of Williams’ crimes is far more graphic than photographs of a man wearing women’s underwear. In fact, the photographs eclipse Williams’ crimes, because they’re so easily absorbed—they finish conversations instead of starting them.,The Star’s consultation with an expert on the ethics of photojournalism feels like an attempt to disavow responsibility for the paper’s decision. Quoting this expert as commending the Star’s “bravery,” hints at damage control. The final line of the Star’s article: “Who among us after all would have ever wanted to face the ugly truth about Col. Russell Williams?” suggests that those offended by the photos and the Star’s decision are somehow condoning Williams’ actions. It’s a suggestion that is both absurd and offensive.,Ultimately, there’s no final word on the “right” decision each publication should have made. But for now, one paper’s explanation holds more water than the other."},{"title":"Shocking film just isn’t","url":"/story/2010-10-12/editorials/shocking-film-just-isnt/","date":"October 12, 2010","content":"In one of the most controversial studies of the 1960s, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram showed that authority figures can often override an individual’s moral beliefs, even leading them to kill a complete stranger.,Milgram’s experiment put test subjects in a position where they were ordered, by a phony researcher, to administer increasingly strong electrical shocks to a stranger.,The majority of subjects agreed—even when the shocks were of a lethal strength. Milgram’s study is the inspiration for a French documentary entitled Le jeu de la mort, currently playing in Quebec.,The film reenacts the obedience experiment by putting participants in a fake game show with the same premise, delivering shocks to another person while an audience watches. If a participant becomes reluctant, the audience eggs them on from the sidelines.,The vast majority of participants administered lethal shocks, even though the show offered no cash prize for participating.,The film’s creators meant to expose the dangers of television. They allege that contestants were so enraptured by the thought of being on television, and so overwhelmed by the glamour of the game show set, that they were willing to commit murder. The general public takes television for granted, unaware of its deadly potential.,It’s important to note the form the filmmakers chose to test their theory: the so-called “reality” TV show.,While seeing Milgram’s study reenacted in a modern setting is interesting, it’s far from hard science. The film’s creators aren’t scientists and it’s likely they had an outcome in mind when they started their project.,Reality TV bears the faintest possible similarity to real life. Imagining that it is in some way representative of how things work in the “real” world is pretty far-fetched.,The most interesting “conclusion” offered in the film—that members of visible minority groups are least susceptible to mass pressure—borders on stereotyping.,In any case, what is the viewer supposed to take from this conclusion? The simple act of watching television doesn’t place us in control over life and death, nor is it likely an unscrupulous broadcaster will suddenly attempt to incite a riot using high-pressure programming.,Concluding that television can make us kill doesn’t really fit the picture."},{"title":"Being sad isn’t all bad","url":"/story/2010-10-15/editorials/being-sad-isnt-all-bad/","date":"October 15, 2010","content":"In an article published in Monday’s Globe and Mail, Sarah Hampson considers the overlooked value of one of humanity’s less appreciated emotions: sorrow.,The article, titled “Don’t always look on the bright side of life” suggests that we live in a culture which seeks to purge sadness entirely, in favour of a “relentless focus on happiness.” Sadness has become so undesirable that we can’t share it with others. Hampson suggests that we’re afraid to admit that we’re sad because we don’t want to appear weak or self-indulgent in the eyes of others.,Hampson differentiates between depression and the feeling of sadness—the former being a serious problem.,Hampson consults with experts in psychology and sociology, and concludes that we need to acknowledge the valuable role sadness plays in the normal range of human emotions.,Aside from informing any number of artistic or creative endeavours, she points out that sadness plays a crucial role in letting us know when something is wrong, especially when we need to reflect on the decisions we’ve made.,Sadness also gives us a point of reference to savour other emotions—we appreciate being happy more because we know how unpleasant it is to be sad.,While it’s difficult to accept that being sad is a good thing, the Globe article makes a number of good points.,We don’t do ourselves any favours by overlooking how we feel. One of the most effective ways of dealing with sadness, or the problem that is causing it, is to share that sadness with someone else.,A reluctance to share our feelings with others prevents us from gaining perspective. Our friends and family often help us understand who we are, and help us with emotional concerns. Part of being more willing to talk is being more willing to listen. By marginalizing the problems of others—or by focusing entirely on our own lives—we contribute to the idea that there is something inherently wrong about being sad and we deny others an outlet to share.,However, we need to keep in mind the distinction between engaged discussion and blind sympathy. Validating the emotional concerns of others doesn’t mean that we should become a culture of bleeding hearts and pillowy shoulders to cry on. We shouldn’t be afraid to disagree with others when it seems like they’re being unreasonable or self-indulgent. Doing this is still considerably more helpful than refusing to talk at all.,We should listen to and engage with the concerns of others, because it’s the easiest way to help ourselves as well."},{"title":"Man up?

Consequently, men now come with their balls—as Cribb colourfully puts it—“pre-busted.”,As much has Cribb has a point—that popular television shows often revolve around a bumbling male character—it isn’t only men who suffer in these pop culture productions. Television and media in general are a form of escapism, not the final word on gender politics. It’s a bad idea to use them as some kind of benchmark for relationships on the other side of the screen.,More often than not, the bumbling male character has a long-suffering wife or girlfriend, who has to forgive his latest screw-up and accept his firm promise that he won’t do it again—until next week, when he does. Hardly a role most women would jump to embrace.,It’s hard to decide what’s most troublesome about the Star editorial. There’s the basic assumption that being a man automatically involves certain “manly” responsibilities, the suggestion that pop culture dictates how we perceive each other or the idea that men and women are trapped in an “us vs. them” mentality.,The idea that being a man “has to” mean certain things is short-sighted and offensive, and does nothing but contribute to gender stereotypes. Advocating for a return to the primal manhood of yesteryear, Cribb overlooks that the flexibility of gender roles is exactly what has made it possible for women to shake off proscribed domesticity.,The real problem with the Star editorial is that Cribb fails to articulate any of the terms he assumes the reader will take for granted. This makes the content controversial, without being articulate: what exactly does “manning up” entail? What is involved in returning to “the ancient protocols of manhood”?,Cribb’s interview with Elliott Katz—author of a book entitled Being the Strong Man A Woman Wants—doesn’t answer any of these questions. Instead, the reader gets an unsettling view of how Cribb’s ideas would work in real life, summarized by the following statement: “Leaving decisions to her is very frustrating for women. We all believe in gender equality. But you’re still the man and you have to take charge.”,Who made Katz the spokesperson for women, everywhere?,And who made Cribb the spokesperson for men, anywhere?"},{"title":"Last doesn’t lack lustre","url":"/story/2010-10-22/editorials/last-doesnt-lack-lustre/","date":"October 22, 2010","content":"Ontario municipal elections will take place on Monday, October 25. The Journal’s editorial board sat down with the six candidates running in the City of Kingston’s mayoral race. Each candidate was asked an identical set of three questions, which focused on student housing issues, Town-Gown relations and public transportation.,The Journal believes that a Queen’s student’s vote is best directed towards John Last.,Last stood out as a candidate due to the uniqueness of his ideas. Several of the candidates stated that increased bylaw enforcement would be a key component of addressing current property standards issues in the student neighbourhood.,However, Last suggested a specific strategy targeting problem areas by “setting zones where those bylaws should be enforced more rigorously.” Furthermore, he is in favour of a mass mailing at the beginning of each academic year, making students aware of their rights and responsibilities as renters.,Many candidates were quick to suggest that Town-Gown issues would be best addressed by increased communication and a transparent working relationship between the University and the City. However, Last stressed a more precise platform of communication between the municipal government and the AMS which would allow the AMS to cross-promote relevant information to students in an efficient and timely manner.,He also addressed transportation practically, prioritizing faster service over extending existing routes.,These unique ideas demonstrated an understanding of the issues relevant to the Queen’s community that surpassed any other candidate. Last was well-spoken and addressed questions head-on.,The same can’t be said for the other candidates running under the “Run This Town” banner. Ultimately, the trio may have done been better off choosing one face to clearly represent their platform.,Last was pragmatic in discussing the nature of the “Run This Town” campaign. He was quick to insist that the campaign is not intended as a gratuitous soapbox for existing youth voters. His goal is to make young people aware that they have a real ability to influence the outcome of an election—provided that those who don’t currently vote are mobilized.,While Last can’t lay claim to the same level of experience as some of the candidates in this election he spoke with as much knowledge and authority as any other. He was frank about the likelihood of winning the election, but demonstrated a compelling understanding of what a victory would represent—a genuine dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in municipal politics. Last called this a “mandate for change,” and expressed his hope that his campaign would force the winning candidate to focus more on student issues. It was inspiring to see that he had considered the long-term significance of his campaign.,Candidate Barrie Chalmers lacked Last’s familiarity with the Queen’s community. His suggestion of a Fauxcoming-sanctioned event on Tindall field was interesting, but unlikely. While he supported a joint-committee to discuss Town-Gown issues, his acknowledgement that such a committee would probably not receive funding was discouraging. His suggestion that a two per cent property tax reduction would help landlords save money is valid, but it’s unlikely that the benefits will be passed on to students—they are rarely property owners.,Mark Gerretsen seemed more in touch with Queen’s-related issues. Gerretsen provided a compelling plan for a permanent task force to address Town-Gown issues. He also displayed an informed perspective on the ability of a few “bad apples” to ruin the image of the University. He had an understanding of transportation issues facing Kingston residents, and emphasized community involvement in facing these challenges. However, Gerretsen relied too heavily on his experience as a landlord in framing Town-Gown issues—it would have been nice to encounter a personalized understanding from a Queen’s alumnus.,Rob Matheson provided practical, realistic solutions to the problems he was asked to address. He stressed more stringent measures for students caught misbehaving, and suggested welcoming Queen’s students with a Fauxcoming bash at the K-ROCK centre, not riot police. Of special note was his acknowledgement that the current discussion around Fauxcoming issues is too transparent. This transparency, he said, makes discussion focus on venting public antagonism, and is ultimately counter-productive.,Ultimately, John Last’s insight and unique ideas made him the most compelling candidate. The greatest obstacle Last faces is not inexperience, but rather low voter turnout. Queen’s students, staff, and faculty represent nearly 30,000 people, which makes up a substantial portion of the voting population.,We have a profound ability to influence the outcome of this election, which is what John Last’s campaign is all about."},{"title":"The long & short of it","url":"/story/2010-10-22/editorials/long-and-short-it/","date":"October 22, 2010","content":"We don’t watch soccer because not enough goals are scored.

North American society is obsessed with instant gratification, even though true satisfaction should come from long-term dedication.,Short-sightedness pervades many aspects of our world. One of the reasons that Canada’s aging population is such a large strain to the Canada Pension Plan is that the policy was created at a time when the baby boom was in the labour force. In the short term it was a sound policy, but now that the baby boom is reaching retirement it is simply not feasible without a substantial financial burden on younger people.,We judge our leaders by the stability of the present, which is completely rational. But we need to acknowledge that what goes on in the present is often influenced by what happened in previous terms. Moreover, politicians’ incentives revolve around public appeal and maximizing the number of votes they will get. The welfare of a country’s economy takes a backseat to chasing votes.,The business world may be one of the worst culprits in the chase for a short-term gain. Various companies pay very little attention to the long term. Consider the crash of American car companies in the States. Foreign competition was creating vastly more efficient products, but US producers chose not to innovate or look to the future, instead asking the government to save them. GM specifically lobbied against the innovations of the electric car, ultimately hampering a project that could be hugely productive in the long run.,While some people claim to be making or following long-term plans, I feel that many of us are just going through the motions. As students, we spend years educating ourselves in pursuit of a brighter future. We respect those that go onto graduate school or professional education because we understand the benefits of the commitment.,In personal financing the importance of the long-run is just as vital. Most wealthy people haven’t suddenly struck oil in a field, but have saved gradually over 10s of years, perhaps making sound investments along the way.,Any serious athlete will attest to the immense time commitment necessary to improve skills or shave insignificant amounts of time from a personal record. Those who pursue excellence relentlessly visualize succeeding, and while many don’t make it all the way, for those that do that moment is the greatest of all.,I cannot hope to provide a full argument on this subject with so few words, but I want to emphasize the importance of looking off into the horizon every once in a while and chasing something far away.

It places images of aborted fetuses next to victims of genocide in Rwanda, Darfur, Yugoslavia, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Pearl Harbour, the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City bombing and the racist lynch mobs of 19th century America.,I’m not going to argue about the abortion issue itself. I’m not interested in condemning anyone’s opinions, and I do believe that groups like these have the right to disseminate their message.

Certainly it was their tactics, not their message, which the University of Ottawa saw to be incompatible with their image as a place of learning.,Nobody likes extremism. The Tea Party, the Black Bloc, Al-Qaeda and the like are all nuisances. Any message they have is lost in their childish actions. They prevent any moderate, thoughtful people from participating in their discussion because people are so off-put. Instead, they have to rely on indoctrination.,I’ll bet a lot of anti-abortion groups wonder why they see so many sour faces when holding up signs comparing hard-working doctors to officers of the Third Reich. It’s an insult to reason and intelligence. With the variety of horrific motivations that produced the images used by the GAP, it’s difficult to follow their message. It’s insulting to anyone who has considered abortion to be lumped in with racism and hatred.,Nobody wants to pick up a flyer with those images on it. It’s why people mock the poorly-printed warning labels on cigarettes. The images are so far removed from what people consider reasonable that they react with disgust rather than reflection.,A university campus is supposed to be a place of dignity and discourse, not shock tactics. I’m not surprised that the University of Ottawa’s administration responded the way that they did. As an institution of learning, the University has an image and a reputation to protect. The protestors were given a place to display their signs, but they chose to disobey and demonstrate elsewhere. In order to protect their image—and their students’ stomachs—the administration uninvited the group from protesting. I don’t blame them.,How do anti-abortion groups expect to bring their issues to discussion by turning so many people away immediately?

There isn’t a single culprit.,The spread of pictures from Aberdeen St.—be it on Facebook, in the Whig-Standard or the Journal—take away our faces as Queen’s students. This body of over 20,000 students has a wide variety of interests and attitudes, but in the pictures we are a drunken horde menacing our neighbours and milking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the municipal purse for the police presence required to keep us in line.,Kingston has a population of over 100,000, yet when it comes to describing its residents within a Town-Gown context there are only two portraits—the curmudgeon and the drunken student with a sense of entitlement.,It’s an issue of misconception and Aberdeen illustrates it effectively. I saw one police officer berate a girl with his finger an inch from her nose. She had stopped to talk on the sidewalk instead of adhering to the “keep walking” policy.,Another public order officer told me he volunteered to police Fauxcoming last weekend to ensure public safety and escape Toronto for the weekend.,Chants of “Fuck the Police” were directed at all officers lining the street, regardless of their personal motives for working.,This binary between Queen’s students and non-Queen’s students won’t die fast and neither will Aberdeen St. I hesitate to use “Kingston residents” to refer to non-students because the term is an umbrella that reaches inhabitants of the Queen’s Ghetto. We all live here.,But lawns in the Ghetto are largely vacant of campaign advertisements for this month’s municipal elections. This election is an opportunity for students to assume the role of resident instead of the perceived transient pillagers of the Limestone City.,Debates between candidates for mayor and city councillors are an opportunity for students to display an investment in this community. Every question posed by a student to a prospective councillor will help to indicate that the students of Queen’s are engaged members of the Kingston community—and not part of a binary that is divisive and ever-present.,The student Ghetto and campus is split between three city districts.

Your balance comes from your toes, and to make the spear fall tip-first requires a wrist flick that takes lots of practice.,It’s the technical and counter-intuitive aspects of the sport that keep me so intrigued, but there’s also a visceral level to it. Letting out a feral roar as you whip your arm forward gives a satisfaction that can be felt at the most primal level; it sends a cathartic jolt to your deepest guts.,Not to mention the smile that comes to my face when I think of the echoes of raging Achilles, cunning Odysseus, and courageous Leonidas that this simple implement carries with it. The closest I can get to fighting in the Trojan War is running around with a pointed stick in a park, and that’s just fine with me.,It’s an activity that combines aspects of athletics, history, geometry, precision, strength and technique into a single rhythmic movement.

These were things that you knew were going to happen, yet you still looked forward to them.,Now I know it may seem that as Queen’s students we are more likely to follow traditions, but outside these tricolour walls we all seem to leave behind our passion for tradition and join the masses.,Take the “Oil Thigh” for example. You can often find your average Queen’s student at various sporting events chanting and singing the words to the beloved school song. The students who participate in these school events tend to lose this unifying bond when they graduate and move on to their professional lives.,Some alumni maintain strong ties with the University after graduation, but most people fall short in keeping these bonds once they leave campus.,When I say ‘traditions,’ I don’t necessarily mean long-standing family rituals. By traditions, I’m referring to any group activity that you enjoy.,I think that people fail to recognize that traditions give people the opportunity to participate in something that once meant a great deal to our predecessors.

Have we lost our need for community relations?

The near miss comes in many different flavours: a sharp turn without a shoulder check, a door opened quickly into traffic, or the worst: the angry driver who feels you’re encroaching on his or her private property.,This situation is more common than one might think—only the serious cases make the news. A recent incident near Rougement, Quebec saw three dead and three injured when a truck struck a group of cyclists riding single file on the edge of a busy motorway.,I’ll be the first to admit that it takes two to tango. While many riders lack the experience to ride safely on the road, it’s unfair to blame either cyclists or motorists for being the sole cause of dangerous road conditions. But if experienced cyclists are encountering dangerous conditions every time they ride, then motorists’ contributions cannot be ignored. The dangers aren’t simply caused by minor transgressions—they stem from drivers’ lack of empathy with cyclists.,Stereotypes of riders have built up some dangerous perceptions among non-cyclists. The notion that cyclists are non-taxpaying, un-licensed, rule-breaking pests is pure ignorance. Many cyclists are also drivers, fully aware of the rules of the road. And as citizens, cyclists also pay local taxes. The bottom line is this: we don’t just need more cyclists. What we need are more drivers to become cyclists.,When we were children, learning how to ride a bike was a major milestone. It became possible to explore further, to go places beyond the reach of foot travel. I fondly remember skinned knees, splashing through puddles, and my father’s inevitable two-hour struggle with the minivan’s bike rack before family outings. Riding bikes defined childhood fun.,As we got older, we traded in our two wheels for four. With this new step, our horizons expanded further—bikes were left for those too young to drive. Many of my friends only got back on their bikes once they realized they could sleep in an extra 10 minutes before an 8:30 class—their ridership is now exclusive to saving time.,The truth is that more bikes on the road means a safer environment for all road users. With greater numbers of riders, drivers are reminded that they are not the only ones on the road, in the same way that a police car reminds drivers to curb their speed. Most importantly, bike riders who also drive cars understand the dynamics of being a smaller, human-powered vehicle among a sea of fast moving, metal boxes on wheels.,What’s my suggestion? Go ride. Not just to campus or to the supermarket. Ride just for the sake of riding. Ride to rekindle that childhood fun. Ride to assert that bikes belong. Bikes aren’t just for spandex-clad athletes, car-deprived students, and kids. They’re for everyone, motorists included.,I’ll see you on the road. Give me a wave or a shout.

The author, Gloria Galloway, points out that while women make up half of Canada’s population, they account for a mere 22 per cent of parliamentary seats. In this respect, she says, Canada lags far behind other countries like Angola, Ecuador, Mozambique, Guyana and Afghanistan, which have more female representation in their governments.,It isn’t that women are undereducated. They’re just stuck in the ranks of middle management, afraid of the familial sacrifices and male-dominated atmosphere they’d face should they move up in the ranks.,That same day, another article—this time in the National Post—took a very different stance on a very different issue. The Post article argued that due in part to older celebrity mothers and faulty medical advice, women think they’ll be able to have children later in life.,The article’s author, Tom Blackwell, spoke to a psychology professor who said that while 28 per cent of mothers gave birth after the age of 36, they shouldn’t wait much longer—by the time a woman is 41, technology-aided birth is only successful one per cent of the time.,The article suggested policies should be amended to help women bear children while also having a career, but it put out limited ideas and really only suggested that women with children move at their own pace through the ranks. It didn’t offer a solution, it offered a white flag.,Women today aren’t fighting for spots in universities or equality in the workplace. They were raised with a sense that they could have any career they could imagine so long as they worked hard enough for it. The problem is that diaper bags don’t match power suits and women end up putting off having babies, putting off having a career or else finding a compromise in middle management.,The two articles have conflicting messages. The Globe tells us that women need to focus on their careers and find their way into more leadership positions. The Post tells us women need to stop putting off having babies because of misconceptions about fertility. Both articles hint that a compromise in middle management is less than desirable.,Lately I’ve been focusing on grad school and job applications and I’ve been panicking—I don’t want to be like any of these media stock types. We’re redefining what it means to be a woman in the workplace and these conversations are being played out through media depictions of the frazzled mother and the emotionally distant career-woman.,Balancing work and family is a reality women will have to deal with for sometime. But for my own sake I hope there’s more room for a happy medium than these articles would like to admit."},{"title":"Software’s hard news","url":"/story/2010-09-14/editorials/softwares-hard-news/","date":"September 14, 2010","content":"In a decision made Friday, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal concluded that software developers can place restrictions on the use of their products.,The decision represents a major blow to “first-sale” doctrine, which is a popular defence used against accusations of copyright infringement. The doctrine holds that an individual can resell his or her copy of a copyrighted product however they wish, regardless of the creator’s intentions.,The court concluded that this defence does not apply to software where an individual is only a licensee, without being an owner.,In an age where most people have never read a software license—which is usually lengthy and full of obtuse legal jargon—many will be surprised to discover that they are not “owners” of many of the applications on their computers. While this decision will help developers control the sale of their products, it will further the divide between consumers and software companies.,Many legal software buyers sell their old copies to others to fund the cost of upgrades. But, as the availability of bootleg software persists, consumers are rapidly running out of incentives to purchase software. By demonizing those who attempt to recoup some of the money spent on older software, this decision will likely encourage individuals to pirate software.,Though the decision applies only to nine western U.S. states, this is a dangerous precedent to start. The court’s ruling overturned a decision made in a lower court that first-sale doctrine applies to software. Furthermore, though Greg Beck, the defence attorney in the case, plans to request that the case be reviewed with 11 judges, the initial finding was unanimous—3-0.,The American Library Association protested the court’s decision, concerned that this decision would eventually expand to include other copyright material, effectively making it illegal to resell books or movies. While only time will indicate how far this loss of fair use will spread, this court decision is disturbing news."},{"title":"Curtain call for Indian Act","url":"/story/2010-07-27/editorials/curtain-call-indian-act/","date":"July 27, 2010","content":"In an impassioned speech delivered July 20, Assembly of First Nations head Shawn Atleo insisted that the time has come for the aboriginal community to take an active role in determining its status within Canada.,Speaking at the AFN’s annual assembly, Atleo said the time has come for the aboriginal community to craft a more autonomous relationship with the federal government. He insists this project should include rejecting both the Indian Act and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, governmental structures he charges as condemning the aboriginal population to one of the lowest qualities of life of any Canadian population.,Mr. Atleo’s concerns are well-founded. The Indian Act—which determines who has aboriginal status, as well as regulating taxation, band membership, and land management—has a long and checkered history. After coming into law in 1876, the Indian Act became a government tool to encourage assimilation of Canada’s aboriginal population throughout the first half of the twentieth century.,This assimilation included interfering in aboriginal cultural affairs, and the forced enfranchisement of aboriginal peoples.,While some of the major shortcomings of the Indian Act have been addressed, it is no longer practical to amend and re-amend a document created nearly 150 years ago. The time has come to create a new approach to negotiating aboriginal affairs, especially as the aboriginal community faces widespread poverty and horrific living conditions on reservations.,The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs is equally tainted, reminding many Canadians of the residential schools in which many First Nations, Inuit and Métis children were subjected to physical and sexual abuse.  ,Debate concerning removing the Indian Act will be fiercely divided within aboriginal communities and on the political stage. Some will accuse aboriginal leaders of attempting to expand current entitlements beyond what is equitable. Others will insist that those who support the Indian Act are the relics of a paternalistic era where the aboriginal community is concerned. Regardless, the current living conditions and abuses suffered by the aboriginal community are strong evidence to support Mr. Atleo’s goals. The time has clearly come for a change. "},{"title":"Stay abreast of reality","url":"/story/2010-09-17/editorials/stay-abreast-reality/","date":"September 17, 2010","content":"In a story printed in Tuesday’s Globe and Mail, Laura Blenkinsop considered the merits of various “nursing covers.” These apron-like garments allow a woman to nurse without exposing herself in public.,Nursing covers have become popular partly because of ongoing concerns about public breastfeeding. The article lists related incidents that have occurred in Canada over the last year, where breastfeeding women have been asked to move or cover up.,While it is easy to understand that some individuals might be uncomfortable seeing the breast or nipple of a stranger, it’s up to the individual to negotiate his or her discomfort. Women are allowed to breastfeed in public across Canada, with Ontario being one of two provinces to have a specific law encoding this freedom.,Some believe that a woman exposing her breasts in public is in some way indecent or sexually explicit. These individuals must acknowledge that these are personal values which do not impact the decisions made by others. Women breastfeeding are not exposing their breasts as a sexually gratuitous act—and even if they were, going topless is not a crime.,Unfortunately, there is a great disparity between theory and reality. In theory, the public must respect a woman’s right to breastfeed in public. In practice, women who do so will likely encounter problems at one point or another.,Some individuals insist that the nursing covers are easy to use, and that women should consider the feelings of those around them out of politeness. Many are quick to point out that they have an equal right to be made uncomfortable by a woman exposing her breasts in public. While discriminatory or hostile behaviour cannot be tolerated, signs of silent censure—pursed lips and looks of disapproval or shock—are an unfortunate reality.,The presence of designated breastfeeding areas in some spaces further complicates the issue, as opponents to public breastfeeding sometimes pressure—or harass—women into using these spaces, taking the “designated” status as obligatory. These spaces exist to accomodate a woman’s needs, not the delicate sensibilities of the public. This uneasy situation means that women who breastfeed publically must weigh the strength of their convictions against the possibility of public backlash. Some will choose to avoid tension and disapproval. Other will act upon the rights they possess, and face varying degrees of strife along the way. This is far from an ideal choice. For the moment, however, it is the most realistic one."},{"title":"Getting short about form","url":"/story/2010-09-24/editorials/getting-short-about-form/","date":"September 24, 2010","content":"As first-year students adjust to the Queen’s community every September, they never suffer a lack of acronyms. JDUC, QCARD, AMS—the list goes on. An article published in Intelligent Life magazine’s autumn edition considers the growing usage of acronyms like these.,The Intelligent Life article suggests that acronyms are far from an adolescent phenomenon. The perceived generation gap in acronym usage has more to do with context—young people create and use primarily colloquial acronyms, while adults use acronyms in a professional capacity.,The Intelligent Life article’s perspective seems reasonable and rooted in common sense. The most appropriate way to deal with acronyms is to acknowledge that they are mere placeholders, simplifying common or technical expressions to save time. Acronyms hardly represent the demise of the English language—a fear often expressed by those concerned about a generation saturated with instant messaging and texting.,The fact that acronyms are so easily adopted in specific contexts—medical, bureaucratic, social—is a testament to the flexible nature of language. This flexibility is also indicated by the manner in which many colloquial acronyms become blanket terms without an exact usage—“LOL”, for example, can express many degrees of amusement, not just ones that make us laugh out loud.,The only—though very real—downside to acronyms is the burden of proper usage. While acronyms may save time, those who employ them must judge the context in which they do so. LOL may be fine in a text message to a friend, but not in an e-mail to a professor or teaching assistant. Proper context for acronym usage also helps ensure everyone is on the same page, as nothing is harder to understand than speech laden with unfamiliar short forms. When in doubt, it’s probably best to err on the side of caution, and employ them when you can be certain no one will be confused—better that no one get short with you over short forms.,With the above caution in mind, there’s no reason why acronym usage need be considered inappropriate. While time will tell whether acronyms are a passing fad or an entrenched convention, they’ll definitely be around for some time yet."},{"title":"Don’t judge Douglas","url":"/story/2010-09-10/editorials/dont-judge-douglas/","date":"September 10, 2010","content":"A Manitoba associate chief justice is facing calls for her resignation in a controversy around a series of sexually explicit photographs that were posted online.,The pictures of Judge Lori Douglas were taken by her husband, lawyer Jack King, seven years ago. In July, Alexander Chapman filed a complaint with the Canadian Judicial Council, claiming King gave him the photos—and urged him to have sex with his wife—in 2003.,Chapman, a former client of King’s, went public last Tuesday. Public debate has become fiercely divided between those who believe that Judge Douglas must resign, and those who believe that her private life and her judicial career are wholly distinct.,While Judge Douglas made a risky decision by agreeing to take explicit pictures with her husband, calls that she resign—or be ousted by an act of Parliament, as required by law—are extreme. Judge Douglas has done nothing wrong: the photos her husband gave to Chapman depict activities conducted between consenting individuals.,Some individuals feel that Judge Douglas should resign simply for participating in the photos. Judges, they insist, must be held accountable to a different standard than the public.,However, judges are held to the same legal standards as a member of the public, and—as of yet—Judge Douglas appears to have broken no laws. Claims that her actions reflect an inability to make sound decisions are equally unfounded. While Judge Douglas helped create the photos, she clearly appreciated the importance of keeping them from the public eye—her husband has since indicated he acted without her knowledge.,Others insist that Judge Douglas must resign because she can no longer command the respect necessary to do her job.,Judge Douglas’ ability to do her job has nothing to do with her reputation, and everything to do with her knowledge of the law and her ability to apply it. Those individuals over whom she exercises judgement do not have to respect her as a person—or approve of her private life—in order to be bound by her decisions.,Where Judge Douglas’ reputation counts most is exactly where it has been severely damaged; not in the public eye, but rather within the legal community and the eyes of Judge Douglas’ coworkers. The impact of this scandal on Judge Douglas’ professional reputation and career is as detrimental as being fired. Whether or not Judge Douglas is obliged to resign from her position permanently, this controversy is likely the end of any future advancement she may have been working towards.,Those individuals who believe that Judge Douglas needs to be reprimanded for her actions should acknowledge that she already has suffered—and will continue to suffer—a profound punishment."},{"title":"Upselling’s downside","url":"/story/2010-09-17/editorials/upsellings-downside/","date":"September 17, 2010","content":"If you’ve ever gone shopping, I’m sure you’ve experienced something called the ‘upsell’: the wonderfully irritating efforts of sales clerks to offer you every useless bell and whistle imaginable at the checkout.,According to a recent article in the Globe and Mail, those harmless extras can really do a lot of damage to your expenses. The article points out how much money one can waste buying items such as a discount card at Chapters, a breakfast food with a morning coffee, an extra DVD rental for “only a dollar more” and of course those ever-popular “extended warranties” for every piece of technology in existence.,What’s the big deal with getting sucked into spending a couple of extra dollars here and there? I, for example, am a sales clerk’s dream customer: the mention of a muffin with my latte from the friendly Starbucks barista gets me every time and “a dollar more” for an extra item I don’t really need is basically something for nothing, right?,Don’t even get me started on extended warranties—besides having the technological knowledge of a carrot, I’m always worried I’ll do something stupid to my computer like step on it (guilty) or mysteriously cause the “blue screen of death” (also guilty). Needless to say, I never hesitate to drop money on a warranty.,After looking through my bank statements each month, I’m always shocked to find out where my money goes—all those supposedly harmless add-ons add up!,So why, exactly, do I have such a hard time saying no?,Maybe it’s because I realize that many sales clerks aren’t a bunch of secret schemers trying to steal all my money.,Trust me; I’ve been on the other side of the counter. Having worked in retail, I know what it’s like to receive an ominous glare from a manager when my sales pitch doesn’t work out. I’ve also experienced the equally ominous glare from customers clearly telling me to get out of their face. The memories of shamefully slinking away are all too fresh.,Despite being able to sympathize with sales clerks, there’s no way I can continue going through life falling for sales pitch after sales pitch. If you’re like me, how can we steer clear of careless spending?,Although it seems obvious, what really helps me is asking the question “do I really, really need this extra?” During my semi-annual trip to Chapters, should I drop 20 bucks on that 10% discount card? Probably not. When I buy a new iPod, should I shell out the cash for those gimmicky warranties? Well, considering my history, probably.,It’s also often difficult for me to toe the line between assertive politeness and passive acceptance that gives sales clerks the green light to keep offering me stuff. Maybe I smile too much. Or maybe ... I just don’t say ‘no’ enough.

Though lectures will always be a necessary teaching method, Hughes insisted they must be properly taught and supplemented with more modern teaching tools.,Not only do instructors need to focus more closely on encouraging discussion, but should also have some background in teaching itself, she said.,The problem according to Hughes isn’t only that lectures become boring and long-winded, but that lectures begin to emphasize memorization over their intended purpose of encouraging student engagement with material. An instructor’s primary focus needs to be making the content as accessible as possible.,Hughes’ comments address some of the major issues facing university instructors. Since most information is readily available online, students increasingly use the internet to supplement or even replace the lecture process entirely—especially when doing so allows them to avoid 80 minutes of monotony. Rising class sizes have made facilitating discussion increasingly difficult, and lectures are often reduced to a bare recitation of facts in order to ensure all the material is covered.,The lack of formalized teaching experience imparted to instructors means that teaching often becomes a question of individual responsibility. Most instructors value an engaged learning environment, but some are completely disinterested in the instructive component of academia. Faculty members with tenure that don’t value class instruction are often hostile to adjusting their teaching methods, leaving students little recourse.,The key to addressing this issue is increasing student feedback, which will encourage instructors to stay abreast of their student’s needs. In some cases, instructors and students become trapped in a vicious cycle, where an instructor teaching especially dry material in a dry fashion will quickly find student interest flagging, and correspondingly lose interest in attempting to engage students. If instructors make it clear that they are willing to negotiate group learning preferences with their own expectations, each group may be able to reach a model which is satisfying for all.,Lectures will always be a part of post-secondary education. Though satisfying the needs of every student is impossible, universities and educators need to prioritize teaching, and focus on ways to make material accessible to the widest range of students."},{"title":"Globe spins too far","url":"/story/2010-09-21/editorials/globe-spins-too-far/","date":"September 21, 2010","content":"In an article published Sept. 18, the Globe and Mail considered the status of Queen’s University’s reputation as an academic institution. The piece, titled “Crackdown on partying at Queen’s threatens university’s raucus reputation” focuses on the university’s negotiation of alcohol-related issues.,Opening on Aberdeen St.—calling it the “party nexus of Canada’s party university”—the article describes a local landlord eyeing a number of luxury cars parked curbside, and quotes him calling Queen’s students “a bunch of spoiled rich kids who don’t want to be seen with a garbage bag.” Car ownership is far from common among Queen’s students. Among those with said form of transportation, luxury cars are the exception—not the rule. This opening sets the tone which dominates the article—not a tone of hostility, but rather one in which the least-representative elements of the Queen’s community are implicitly set up to stand for the whole.,It isn’t that the Globe’s article makes baseless accusations. The real problem is that the piece fails to contextualize the facts.,It’s nearly impossible to argue that Aberdeen street is not the party nexus of Queen’s. Referring to Queen’s as the party university of Canada is a separate issue.,The article appears to be sensationalizing the party reputation it claims to be describing. Though the Globe firmly states that the 2005 Homecoming street party gave Queen’s students’ reputation a “tinge of recklessness,” little mention is made of any recent problems on a similar scale. The article even points to the docile atmosphere in the student neighbourhood, describing students drinking at “a swift but polite pace.”,In fact, the Globe article focuses largely on the unsanctioned 2005 Aberdeen Street party, and the recent two-year cancellation of Queen’s official Homecoming festivities—a far cry from the vague “crackdown” mentioned in the headline. While the article refers to the university’s cancellation of Homecoming festivities—which it later mistakenly lists as lasting indefinitely—it fails to distinguish between the university-sanctioned Homecoming weekend, and the street party unaffiliated with the university.,These distinctions seem like splitting hairs to a Queen’s student or Kingston resident, but for someone with no knowledge of the university’s stance on the Aberdeen Street party, it sounds as if Queen’s itself condoned an event that left its “reputation in tatters.”,An aside that “the tipsy crowds still come” to the party in September completely overlooks the effective steps that Queen’s and the city of Kingston took to combat the party last year, which saw a drastic reduction in attendees.,Reference to the familiar “Slosh the Frosh” style parties that occur following orientation week is equally vague. While mentioning that Queen’s senate officials plan to do away with these events—due to their promotion of binge-drinking—the article failed to indicate that these events are not university-sanctioned. For those who have no familiarity with Queen’s or the Kingston community, an article like this effectively dictates their perception of the university—a perception long on hype and short on facts. The Globe article sacrifices the best—and largest—parts of the Queen’s community for the sake of documenting the worst—and the smallest. A number of slovenly houses on Aberdeen St.—however offensive—do not represent the majority of student housing, nor is the average Queen’s student likely to glorify living in a pigsty.,As for the street party, Queen’s students aren’t the only ones in attendance. A large portion of those arrested have been from other schools in the area and across Ontario.,It’s odd that the Globe avoids directly acknowledging the reality that Queen’s Vice-Principal John Pierce indicates in the concluding paragraphs of the article—that alcohol-related issues are a problem that every university must deal with. While Queen’s may be a special case due to the density of its student housing—a vital part of what enables street partying in the first place—this is a unique symptom of a common problem.,One quoted student specifically disavows the raucous reputation suggested in the article. Another expresses the same practical view as Vice-Principal Pierce, stating, “Students will drink no matter what you do.” Individuals don’t represent the Queen’s community as a whole. But why couldn’t the Globe find one student willing to act as poster-child for the so-called “party university”?,It’s tempting to react to the Globe’s article with hostility simply because it depicts Queen’s students as luxury-car driving snobs—or, more poetically, as “the blondes of Canada’s university community.” In fact, the real issue is that the headline promises a crackdown at a party university, and delivers neither the former nor the latter.,The faculty, students and alumni of Queen’s University don’t want to be associated with binge-drinking and buffoonery. By re-hashing events from five years in the past, the Globe article has simply ensured that it will take as long as possible for the memories of that distasteful evening to fade."},{"title":"First aid for last call","url":"/story/2010-09-17/editorials/first-aid-last-call/","date":"September 17, 2010","content":"The British Red Cross is promoting a new campaign intended to teach children how to help those suffering asthma attacks, epileptic seizures and other injuries. The most interesting component of the campaign is its emphasis on dealing with alcohol-related issues.,The program, which teaches children resuscitation techniques and the recovery position, was prompted by a Red Cross survey which found that 14 per cent of youths between the ages of 11 and 16 had been involved in an alcohol-related emergency.,It’s hard to find fault with a program that is so in touch with the realities of youth, but it is important that such a program be properly applied and structured.,There is a reasonable concern that the training might create a false sense of security among youth. Young people are often over-confident about their ability to handle alcohol, and brief first-aid training might lead some to believe they are prepared for emergencies beyond the training program’s scope. As with any emergency, seeking properly trained adult assistance is the best first step.,Fears that the program’s teachings might go misapplied and make a bad scenario worse are equally hard to disperse. In the case of alcohol-related emergencies, especially those involving head and neck injuries, minor decisions can make the difference between life and death.,For this reason, it’s probably best that the program be voluntary­­—but strongly encouraged­—so that only those who are interested in learning attend.,The concern that this sort of training might act as an enabling device—putting ideas about drinking into young minds—is hard to stomach.

The university’s library has confirmed that it will provide students access to a variety of games on-site, in a new collection to be unveiled next fall.,The decision to include video games in a university library legitimizes gaming as a cultural medium. There are any number of reasons why video games warrant study at a post-secondary level. Today’s big-title video games feature complex soundtracks, and striking graphic work—some even rivalling that of major Hollywood blockbusters. For students of literature, animation and graphic design, video games are a profound resource to engage with first-hand.,Gaming is also closely related to issues distinct from artistic merit. Video games have always been a source of controversy, and never more so than in the last decade. Games like Grand Theft Auto have prompted sales restrictions or outright bans, sparking debates about freedom of speech and responsible parenting.,While some criticize video games as mere entertainment, it’s important to keep in mind that the material we use to entertain ourselves reveals a great deal about our values. The video games which draw the most fire are usually not violent, but sexually explicit, which says a great deal about the images we believe are the most controversial.,Similarly, the manner in which video games transcend identity—allowing an individual to become someone else—have great relevance to those studying culture. As game designers attempt to provide gamers with a variety of personalized options, including a customized appearance, experts can look to these options and consider what we find desirable, and why.,The library’s inclusion of a selection of older titles is equally laudable. Hands-on experience with classic titles enables those who study video games as entertainment to consider how technological limitations have influenced game development—and vice versa. While the era of the quarter-operated arcade game is long gone, some ubiquitous titles—like Tetris or Pac-Man—are relevant cultural phenomena.,It’s odd that the library’s decision doesn’t appear to coincide with a particular course or program of study in an official context, but many will draw on these resources in an academic context regardless.,While some may criticize the University of Calgary’s new collection, it’s encouraging that the library recognizes that playing video games doesn’t have to mean playing around."},{"title":"Cough-out smoking ads","url":"/story/2010-10-01/editorials/cough-out-smoking-ads/","date":"October 1, 2010","content":"The federal government has said it needs more time to consider how to move forward with more aggressive anti-smoking advertising measures.,The statement was prompted by a letter written by a group of anti-smoking organizations in June.,The letter called for the government to introduce larger and more graphic warning labels on cigarette packs, which would also include a mention of a 1-800 helpline and website aimed at those trying to quit. Cigarette warning labels almost exclusively target those who already smoke, but it’s too easy to avoid the advertising on cigarette packages, simply by asking for the least graphic one on display or by carrying cigarettes in a case.,Once a pack is purchased, the effectiveness of the advertising becomes questionable—smokers need to look at the advertising for mere moments, while the process of smoking a pack takes far longer.,It’s interesting to note that this problem may be exacerbated by a different, though more effective, anti-smoking measure. Previously introduced “power wall” legislation requires all tobacco products sold in convenience stores in Ontario and Quebec to be covered by shields.,While the power wall shields keep cigarettes out of sight, it also reduces the effectiveness of the anti-smoking ads, ensuring that cigarette packages remain invisible until someone has already decided to buy one.,While the fact that smoking kills is almost common knowledge, individuals across Canada and around the world continue to smoke. Anti-smoking groups should focus on reaching individuals before they start smoking—or those who are already in the process of quitting.,More emphasis should be placed on reaching young people before they or their peers start smoking. Further restrictions on smoking in public would ensure that smoking becomes less convenient and less visible.,If anti-smoking groups want to target smokers directly, they should lobby for measures that smokers can’t avoid. Aggressive “sin” taxes on cigarettes would hit smokers where it hurts—their wallets.,While the push for more visible warnings is certainly guided by good intentions, it doesn’t seem like the most practical way to spend money in an effort to combat smoking."},{"title":"Creating carrot cash","url":"/story/2010-09-10/editorials/creating-carrot-cash/","date":"September 10, 2010","content":"The bright and flashy packaging often used to wrap junk food and candy may soon be crossing borders to an unlikely new food item: baby carrots.,A group of carrot producers is launching an ad campaign that aims to make carrots into a “brand” item. These carrots will be sold in packaging similar to potato chip bags, and advertised as being edgy and desirable.,It’s difficult to assess this new approach to selling vegetables. As childhood obesity rates rise, any measure which encourages children to eat vegetables is a laudable one.,However, the attempt to sell more carrots by giving them a new image may be impractical. The type of advertising the carrot producers intend to use is more likely to influence children than adults. Children rarely take an active role in determining their diet, beyond refusing to eat certain foods.,If parents aren’t involved in encouraging their children to eat vegetables, those children are unlikely to develop a sudden interest in a less than popular childhood food. This problem is amplified by practical concerns; junk food is often cheaper than fresh produce, a major factor in guiding the dietary decisions parents make.,The nature of the plan raises troubling questions about how we relate to the food we eat. Dietary decisions should be based on an informed understanding of the health benefits of eating certain foods, not influenced by whichever food product has the neatest advertising.,As good food attempts to masquerade as bad food and vice versa, making informed decisions may become significantly more difficult for the average consumer. The possibly detrimental long-term effects of this process may be hinted at in a Twitter post made by the company, encouraging people to eat carrots “like there’s no tomorrow (maybe there won’t be) ...”. This is the same sort of devil-may-care advertising that once made cigarettes popular.,Ultimately, it’s difficult to say whether or not the carrot branding plan will prove to be a good or bad idea. In the meantime, it’s probably best that we continue to eat what’s good for us, and avoid what isn’t as much as possible—however edgy it may be."},{"title":"Places in your spaces","url":"/story/2010-09-28/editorials/places-your-spaces/","date":"September 28, 2010","content":"IPhone-owning Facebook users may quickly become the most visible users of the popular social networking site, due to a new feature made available Friday. Facebook’s “Places” feature allows a user with Facebook’s iPhone application to use the phone’s GPS to broadcast his or her location—following pre-input landmarks—to update his or her Facebook profile in real-time.,A Facebook spokesperson was quoted as saying the new feature was an attempt to accommodate users who already use their Facebook status boxes to narrate their whereabouts.,It’s important to note that this is not unbroken ground. The social networking site Foursquare awards users points for “checking in” at certain locations using their GPS enabled phones—and users have the option of posting their Foursquare locations on Facebook and Twitter. Businesses stand to gain a lot from a feature like Places, which will enable them to target people on the go, not just those seated at computer screens. While the Places feature suggests Big Brother-style surveillance to some, Facebook’s latest toy is an opt-in feature, so those who don’t want to trumpet their location on an immediate basis are free to stay away. Those who choose to use the Places feature should exercise common sense in doing so. While some people don’t mind the idea of their Facebook friends being able to track them online, it’s important to remember that Facebook profiles can be left logged in on public computers, or compromised by snooping friends. Facebook offers its usual range of adjustable privacy preferences in terms of how a user’s location is shared, and any responsible user should be familiar with how they work.,The concerns don’t stop there, however. Other users have the option to input addresses to track their location—including those referring to friends who don’t have the feature. While a Facebook representative was quoted as saying that unwanted information can be taken down “within a matter of hours,” the thought of one’s home address secretly floating around on the internet is disconcerting at best.,Any process of social networking involves placing some personal information in the public eye. In this sense, Facebook’s Places feature is a handy reminder of the real purpose of social media. As much as it’s comforting to imagine that websites like Facebook exist to facilitate social networking, they also serve the interests of the advertisers and companies that use them to target clientele.

You know this person’s full name, their hometown, their birthday and any mutual friends you may have. Why is it so difficult to interact with them in person?,Since the advent of social media, the lines between friends, family, acquaintances, hook-ups, exes, pseudo-acquaintances, coworkers and strangers have blurred. The privileged information that you used to reserve for your closest friends is now readily available to the five-hundred-or-so people that are able to view your profile.,Back in the day, your friendships were measured by the time you were willing to invest in them and the information you were willing to share with your closest circle. But friends lists on Facebook today are usually in the hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals. The reality is that humans aren’t made to keep track of so many people, let alone meaningful relationships.,Aside from the superficial friendships that Facebook and Twitter have created, social media may be damaging the real relationships we already have. It’s become so easy to maintain contact with our friends through technology that we begin to take for granted what really strengthens those bonds: human interaction. Status updates may have made it easier for us to follow developments in our friends’ lives, but they’ve also led to a passive approach to staying in touch that may be pushing us away from each other without us realizing it.    But the side effects of social media aren’t limited to relationships. Texting and instant messaging give us the luxury of being able to type out and edit our comments before we send them, something that does not translate well to face-to-face interaction. The filter normally honed through years of conversation is rusty at best, and we find ourselves saying a little too much before we realize that there is no delete button in real life. The truth is, we’ve forgotten the art of conversation.,I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t victim to these social pitfalls. And the reality is that social media aren’t going away any time soon. Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are only going to become more entrenched in our lives as time goes on. But it’s important to remember that at the end of the day, these portals are effectively glorified phone books, and not a replacement for real, human relationships. It’s time for all of us go offline and spend some time with our friends face-to-face. And no, Skype doesn’t count.  "},{"title":"Get in bed with Eds","url":"/story/2010-09-14/editorials/get-bed-eds/","date":"September 14, 2010","content":"My name is Elias Da Silva-Powell and I’m the Editorials editor of the Journal for this year.,Almost immediately after starting at the Journal, I realized that many people don’t understand how editorials are generated. As the year begins, I want to address the most common misconceptions in order to spare our regular readers unnecessary confusion.,Misconception #1: The editorials are written anonymously by members of the Queen’s community.,I’m responsible for writing the unsigned editorials on the left-hand side of this page. The content and direction of the editorials is determined by the editorial board. I also edit the signed editorial columns that occupy this space, and lay out the page itself, as well as the masthead below.,Misconception #2: The Editorials editor can use this page as a soapbox to express his or her opinion.,Before every issue of the Journal is printed, I bring in stories for the Journal’s editorial board to discuss. Frequently, other members of the board suggest alternative topics. The topics we address are chosen by a straight vote, with each board member voting twice.,Misconception #3: The stance taken in the editorials page is the opinion of every Journal staff member.,While the editorials page is intended to act as the “voice” of the Journal, it’s difficult to combine the feedback offered by every member of the editorial board into one statement. Sometimes the editorial board has to take one stance on an issue—like endorsing a political candidate.,In these cases, the stance is determined by a majority vote, of (50 per cent + 1 vote) of the individuals who attended that editorial board. Attendance is mandatory, but must consist of at least 1/3 of the total number of members. Debate is usually strong and a unanimous opinion quite rare. For the sake of encouraging open discussion, what is said at editorial board remains private.,In other words: if the Journal runs an editorial taking a stance you don’t especially like, don’t conclude that this was the opinion of any one individual. I have often heard people insisting that an individual from the Journal adheres to an opinion based on the Journal in the paper; this is incorrect.,I do my best to represent the Journal’s stance as accurately and concisely as possible. However, I am not a specialist on every topic we discuss, nor is 400 words a lot of space to communicate an opinion. I’m completely willing to accept responsibility for the content in this section of the paper. I am however unwilling to state that the opinions expressed on this page are the opinions of any one individual at the Journal, including myself.,I encourage you to respond to the editorials online, as they are intended to encourage discussion and debate. Further information about Journal policy is available on our website.,Just don’t gear up for an argument when you see me around campus, ok?"},{"title":"Refuse back-to-school blues","url":"/story/2010-09-10/editorials/refuse-back-school-blues/","date":"September 10, 2010","content":"A few weeks ago as I was preparing to move into a new apartment and begin the new school year, I went to Staples to stock up on school supplies. As a child, nothing excited me more than the prospect of humming and hawing with my dad about which pencil case would go best with my recently purchased binders. ,Back-to-school time was just about the most exciting part of my year. It wasn’t just the new purchases that excited me; my excitement was almost entirely tied to my undying love for school itself. ,My recent trip to Staples was considerably less enjoyable than trips past. I spent no more than 10 minutes in the store, quickly grabbing the cheapest supplies I could see and then rushing out, the panic in me already beginning to rise. While school supply shopping once evoked feelings of joy and anticipation, it’s now a stress-causing reminder that school is just around the corner.,That’s not to say that I’m dreading my classes, or that I don’t find my area of study interesting. It’s just that the stakes are a lot higher now (something that my nerves are quite aware of).,My generation is often painted as careless and carefree, but I think the real problem is not that we care too little, but that we care about too many things. In my experience, it’s rare to find a student who doesn’t have multiple extra-curricular obligations, a part-time job, athletics or all of the above on top of their busy course load.,I’m certainly not alone in dealing with this problem, and I think it’s become expected for post-secondary students and even secondary students to feel tense at the thought of school. In the previous issue of the Journal I wrote about stress, and I find it hard to think of a student who wouldn’t benefit from the advice offered in the article.,It’s easy to suggest in the mellow days before classes start that what students really need to do is take a deep breath or something equally useless, but what I think students do need to do is put things in perspective.,I think back to the sleepless nights in high school that I spent powered by nothing but Red Bull and adrenaline, and I have to shake my head at my nearly driving myself into a state of panic over assignments that mattered little in the grand scheme of things. On top of that, I can look back at the work that I stayed up all night to finish and note that it likely would have been much better had it not been completed in a caffeinated frenzy.,University assignments are obviously worth a great deal more than those in high school, but a single assignment rarely makes or breaks a student’s academic career, and the stress of worrying about such things usually does the most harm of all.,Everyone knows that university is challenging and sometimes tedious, but with the right attitude I think it can also be exciting and stimulating. I may not have adopted this attitude entirely yet, but I hope that as my studies go on I can gradually put my stress and fear at bay and learn to love school again."},{"title":"Conrad Black, I salute you","url":"/story/2010-07-27/editorials/conrad-black-i-salute-you/","date":"July 27, 2010","content":"Recently, former Canadian media mogul Conrad Black was released from a Florida prison after serving less than three years of a seven year sentence.,Expressing opinions on Black has long been a preoccupation for members of the Canadian media. In the past few years, Black has been labelled everything from a malicious robber baron to a tragic hero, plagued chiefly by his own hubris.,Conrad Black is neither of these things. He is an unwilling victim of both a crusading U.S. judicial system and the political milieu that made it possible.,It should come as no surprise that Lord Black has remained the whipping boy for many commentators in this country. This is a man who betrayed his country and abandoned his Canadian citizenship in order to play dress-up across the ocean, right?,Well, no. But those who have derided Black are not interested in discussing the painfully anachronistic Nickle Resolution, because it’s not really about Black the man, it’s about Black the idea.,From Enron to Bernie Madoff, from oil spills to risky lending practices, the public animosity toward private enterprise is understandable. However, this outrage has precipitated a backlash against business that has done far more harm than good.,The public now perceives the entrepreneurial spirit itself as malicious and exploitative, and the government and judiciary systems have nurtured this perception. Consequently, they unjustly targeted perhaps the most opulent and bombastic business figure of our time: Baron Black of Crossharbour.,His incarceration was part of a broader trend that has been labelled by some commentators as “the criminalization of business.” The “honest services” law used to convict Black was so poorly conceived that it was deemed “unconstitutionally vague” in a unanimous decision by the US Supreme Court. The criminalization of business is real, and it is dangerous.,In a story filled with humiliation and injustice, perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is the waste of resources. Black was initially accused of stealing $400 million, but was only convicted for $2.9 million of fraud. Now even that charge has been thrown out.,Compare these amounts to the $200 million price tag for the investigation that led to Black’s arrest, not to mention the millions spent on his trial and imprisonment. We are all victims of this disaster.,I am also sympathetic to Black the man, who will never recoup the time, wealth and status that were stolen from him. But the majority of Canadians still see him as the apotheosis of business in the new millennium, an arrogant cosmopolitan on the psychopathic pursuit of profit. A perennial victimizer, never a victim.,That brings me back to my original point. The conviction of Conrad Black was made possible by an environment not only hostile to business, but also to those who make it their craft. We will only be able to move past this fiasco when we realize that society is not a zero-sum game, and Lord Black’s success is not our failure."},{"title":"Celeb news, isn’t","url":"/story/2010-09-24/editorials/celeb-news-isnt/","date":"September 24, 2010","content":"As an assistant news editor I am generally told what is newsworthy. But that doesn’t stop me from being horrified by what the general public looks for in the news.,The legitimization of celebrity news by supposedly serious news outlets is downright scary, and it has been this way for quite some time.,Jessica Simpson’s shockingly abnormal weight gain is thought to be an appropriate topic to be placed next to a story about President Obama. CNN, once the ultimate source of all things newsworthy, apparently considers Tiger Woods’ extramarital affairs deserving of the public’s attention.,And God forbid Britney Spears leaves the car without underwear on—again.,Am I the only one who sees a problem with this?,Granted, I’m guilty of having a sick obsession with celebrity gossip too. I’ve been known to enjoy reading/allowing my brain to be turned to mush by Perez Hilton just as much as anyone else.,I’m not proud to say I engage in the voyeurism of celebrity culture during my leisure time. But when did mindlessly reading this garbage become a form of appropriate behaviour?,A frightening majority of the educated, intelligent people I know are shamelessly admitting their love for the characters on MTV’s newest reality disaster Jersey Shore; characters who I hope are playing up their mind-numbing, logic-defying, STI-welcoming actions.,The frightening thing is that many people, young and old, don’t even realize that these “reality” characters are pseudo-celebrities. Kate Gosselin, Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi and Bachelorette number 500 to name a few are all featured prominently on television, magazines, and for what?,Apparently the sacrifice of dignity is now sufficient justification to warrant public attention. While these types of people mercilessly offer their lives and often exploit their own children for our enjoyment, it is our choice to buy into these trainwrecks.,We are the ones who watch their shows, read about them in magazines, and are addicted to following literally every aspect of their lives. It is my hope that at some point in the near future we will start looking up to people who have worked hard and deserve our respect, instead of the money-grubbing, attention-seeking Lindsay Lohans of the world.,When will our generation start to form opinions about real issues, issues that we have the power to change? Our endless fascination with these celebrities could be put to a much better use.,For the sake of the intelligence and respectability of my generation, I hope that if reality stars whose IQ is seriously questionable continue to stick around, we can all just acknowledge their idiocy and allow them to fade into obscurity… at least until they make a new sex tape."},{"title":"One child, many troubles","url":"/story/2010-09-28/editorials/one-child-many-troubles/","date":"September 28, 2010","content":"Thirty years after China’s “one-child” policy was first introduced, the Chinese government has started to consider relaxing the rules in some provinces, the Globe and Mail reported Sunday.,The policy is a blanket term used to describe a complicated set of restrictions that determine the number of children a family may have. Restrictions are based on factors like parent family size, province of residence and previously-born children with disabilities. The one-child policy was introduced in an attempt to combat resource scarcity and spare China’s strained educational system and labour market.,There is no simple perspective on the one-child policy. Critics are quick to point out the policy’s shortcomings, which have resulted in sterilizations and forced abortions in some areas. Also, state-determined limitations on family size run contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.,While the policy appears to be guided by a concern for the well-being of the current population, it has created long-term problems that may be more difficult to resolve than simply repealing existing restrictions. China has a reported birth ratio of about 1.19 male children for each female birth—far above the usual ratio of 1.05 to 1. Some claim this is a direct consequence of the one-child policy, as the cultural preference for male children places female babies at a higher risk of abortion or infanticide. An abundance of single men—and the difficulty of finding a female partner—feeds an increasing occurrence of wife and infant trafficking. The gradual easing of the birth restrictions—which weren’t universal to begin with—suggests that the one-child policy will eventually be scrapped. Some experts suggest that large families are now less likely to occur, as rising housing and education costs have a similar effect on family size.,The real issue the Chinese government and population face is what originally led to the one-child policies in the first place. If the Chinese economy cannot support a “natural” population growth, they will inevitably encounter difficulties with or without external limits on population—a rapidly aging working class is first among these issues. Whether or not the one-child laws are entirely abandoned, the Chinese government still faces many hurdles in terms of population growth."},{"title":"Fashion’s curve ball","url":"/story/2010-09-21/editorials/fashions-curve-ball/","date":"September 21, 2010","content":"I’m sure I’m not alone in flipping through this month’s issue of Vogue with a feeling of excitement and relief at the article “Va Va Boom,” which explores the increasing number of runway shows that are using curvier models instead of teenage waifs.,I skimmed through the pages of perfect models, with their perfect faces, perfect hair and perfect bodies, unable to focus on the stories as I was so ready to see healthier models that look like me.,And then—after 600 pages—I reached the story, about how “bodacious Victoria’s Secret models are bringing their sexy curves to the catwalk.”,Wait. Victoria’s Secret models are supposed to be the new image of healthy women? Arguably they are curvier than most models, but they are far from your average woman. These women strut down the runway in sparkly lingerie with massive angel wings on their backs—clearly something most of the world can’t relate to.,I know this argument has been raised again and again, but how hard is it to get some models that look like the rest of the world? Modeling should emphasize what the rest of the population looks like, not what we dream of looking like.,The movement of designers like Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton to use curvier models is a step in the right direction, but it is also a reflection that the fashion world and society as a whole are still not accepting of truly curvy women.,Take Christina Hendricks, the gorgeous star of Mad Men. She’s undoubtedly the definition of bodacious curves, but her size draws fire every time she goes out in public.,The worst occurred at this year’s Golden Globes when fashion critic for the New York Times, Cathy Horyn wrote “You don’t put a big girl in a big dress.”,To essentially call a woman with curves fat is only further causing women—and especially young women—to lose self-esteem as we fail to look like the skinny models on magazine covers.,My favourite recent fashion move is by Victoria Beckham, who on The View said “I just want to celebrate a woman’s curves. Although, you’re right, I don’t have that many myself.”,Victoria: you don’t have any curves at all. There is something extremely off-putting about having a tiny fashion designer tell us she is celebrating curves. The implication is that she’s in a position of superiority and must help us lowly curvy women feel like we are beautiful.,Why can’t we all just practice what we preach? If fashion designers say that they want to celebrate curves and healthy women, maybe they should actually get models with real curves that look like real women. I doubt my fairytale world of real models will come true anytime soon, but at least Victoria’s Secret models are a small, albeit sparkly, step in the right direction."},{"title":"No abortions abroad","url":"/story/2010-05-18/editorials/no-abortions-abroad/","date":"May 18, 2010","content":"Stephen Harper’s stance on foreign aid threatens to re-open a debate that has been uneasily settled in Canada for more than twenty years. In 2009, Prime Minister Harper announced that child and maternal health programs in developing countries are to be a major focus at the upcoming G8 summit in June.,On May 10, International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda explained that the Conservative government’s approach to international aid “does not mean supporting abortions.” While the Conservatives are willing to consider incorporating contraception into their maternal health programs abroad, abortion will not be included under any circumstances.,The formulation of an aid program by a developed country to aid a developing neighbour suggests that the former has the ability to make decisions that are in the latter’s best interest. Harper’s approach runs contrary to a key tenet of foreign aid, the understanding that citizens of all nations are entitled to certain basic rights and amenities which must be provided. 98 per cent of all unsafe abortions take place in developing countries with restrictive abortion laws, resulting in 70,000 deaths annually. It is hypocritical for the Canadian government to formulate an aid program which fails to ensure a medical right which its own citizens enjoy. Harper’s insistence upon a definition of family planning that excludes abortion is clearly an attempt to curry favour with his constituents. This suggests that the Conservative government has put ideology ahead of effective foreign aid.,Where abortions are going to occur, they must be safe. Funding safe abortions would help protect the lives of would-be mothers who would otherwise be forced to place their lives in jeopardy. Whether the Conservative government likes it or not, the Canadian definition of family planning encompasses the right to elective abortion; Canadian foreign aid must reflect this right.,Stephen Harper is the Prime Minister of Canada. He should therefore limit himself to endorsing Canadian laws and values, and avoid promoting policies abroad which he cannot enforce at home."},{"title":"No prom, no gain","url":"/story/2010-03-26/editorials/no-prom-no-gain/","date":"March 26, 2010","content":"Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Mississippi cancelled its prom after the administration learned student Constance McMillen wanted to bring a female date and wear a tuxedo, BBC News reported March 23.,McMillen, who identifies as a lesbian, lives in Fulton. Mayor Paul Walker acknowledged the town is “conservative” and “deep in the Bible Belt” with a Baptist following.,School officials said they cancelled the prom because McMillen’s situation was becoming a “distraction to the learning process.” The principal has received several e-mails supporting McMillen’s cause, in which he has been called a bigot and a homophobe for canceling the event.,McMillen recently appeared as a guest on the Ellen DeGeneres show, where she was given a $30,000 cheque to go towards her college tuition.,For a school to be preoccupied with the identity of any student’s prom date is trivial, but the outcry in McMillen’s case is unfair and unwarranted.,Her school’s belief that opening the floor to same-sex prom dates would be distracting to students’ learning is shortsighted. Encountering issues of sexual orientation is more likely to inform students’ perspectives than to detract from their education.,Cancelling Itawamba Agricultural High School’s prom this year has caused significant upset among students and has the unfortunate effect of pitting McMillen against the rest of her classmates. The school’s decision is reprehensible in that it ostracizes a student for her identity.,Presenting McMillen with a scholarship is a strange response to the issue that fails to address her real concerns. The donation links socioeconomic status with homosexuality, a parallel that may not be intentional but is nonetheless harmful. In this case, money is misguided altruism that will do little to make up for the scorn McMillen will undergo in her school community.,Given the town of Fulton’s strong Baptist convictions, it’s not surprising same-sex prom dates are causing a stir. But it would be limiting to peg the school’s decision on faith alone without considering other reasons for the choice.,It’s unfortunate McMillen’s school principal has to shoulder the blame and face pejorative labels for a decision made to reflect the views of the larger community that may have little to do with his personal ethics.,Regardless of the fate of the prom, McMillen should be applauded for coming out in her hometown, where it’s clear a queer identity is not as accepted as it should be."},{"title":"Finding XXX on the WWW","url":"/story/2010-06-29/editorials/no-prom-no-gain/","date":"June 29, 2010","content":"Almost anything can be found on the Internet. This has long been the Internet’s greatest strength, but is also its greatest weakness. Since anything can be found online, it is often difficult to find specific content.,This has never been a problem with pornography. Finding pornography on the Internet is like finding clouds in the sky; despite your best efforts, you will see some.,One company wants to make the easy task of finding pornography online a little easier. ICM Registry has submitted an application to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to register the domain name “.xxx.” Websites registered under this domain would end in .xxx, as opposed to .com, .ca or other common suffixes. ICM’s goal is to provide an easy way for websites to indicate the pornographic content that they provide.,After initially approving the .xxx domain in 2005, ICANN came under fire from religious and special interest groups opposing the application. ICANN subsequently denied ICM permission in 2007. It took ICM three years to get the decision overturned.,Fighting the creation of a adult-specific domain is counterintuitive even if one opposes this content. Providing a direct means of indicating explicit material hardly makes a substantial change in the simplicity of locating pornography, as the Internet is already saturated with adult-only content.,By providing a domain which could be blocked entirely by child protection software, ICM’s plan would make the Internet slightly safer for young users—though websites are not obliged to register, less accessible adult content must be considered as an advantage. ICM has shown a laudable commitment to protecting young Internet users, pledging to donate $10 from each website’s annual registration fees to various initiatives that report and combat child pornography.,If ICM’s plan is successful, registering as an .xxx could become a standard move for pornographic websites, allowing them to be accessed more easily by adult content-seekers and quickly categorized by parental controls. Ideally, this registration would become mandatory, effectively addressing the concerns of both parents and religious groups alike. However, this would mean creating a universal definition of what constitutes pornographic content, something that is far from established. While the .xxx domain may not revolutionize Internet pornography, it is certainly a step in the right direction."},{"title":"Posters beyond provocative","url":"/story/2010-03-12/editorials/posters-beyond-provocative/","date":"March 12, 2010","content":"The Vagabond Theatre’s posters promoting an upcoming production of The Merchant of Venice, a play written by William Shakespeare, have come under fire for their offensive use of Nazi symbolism.,The posters show a Nazi flag without its characteristic swastika, but with a star of David in its place. The posters were designed to advertise a production directed by students Nathaniel Fried and Ryan LaPlante which aims to address the anti-Semitism in Shakespeare’s era by comparing it to the issue’s 20th-century connotations.,Since hearing of the controversy, Fried and LaPlante have removed any remaining posters across campus, which were initially approved by the JDUC front desk, and have apologized to Queen’s Hillel.,The directors encourage anyone who has been offended by the posters to buy a ticket to see their show.,The promotional poster apparently aimed to have shock value and failed to clearly address the academic look at anti-Semitism the production claims to take. Subversion of common symbols or expectations is nothing new from Vagabond Theatre, but the creation of this month’s Merchant of Venice poster verges on hate imagery rather than innocent controversy.,Depicting the Star of David, a symbol of Judaism, superimposed upon a Nazi flag, an overt symbol of oppression, is offensive to Jewish people, especially in the context of the play’s 20th-century set.,The fact the poster was approved in the first place is unsettling and suggests there should be much more pointed discretion involved in the approval process.,It’s encouraging the production’s directors have taken positive steps to make amends. It’s unlikely the directing team intended to create hate imagery, but it was insensitive to use the subverted Nazi symbol for advertising in a public space where people don’t have a choice of whether or not to view it. With little context to justify its boldness, the poster failed to be productive.,Pushing boundaries in a mature and informed way for artistic reasons is one thing, but creating sensational symbolism to sell tickets is another. The Merchant of Venice poster demonstrates a choice made without considering its possible ramifications.,The directors’ desire for people to come see the play, even if they found the poster’s symbolism offensive, is transparent.

While many criticize these security measures as excessive—the six-kilometre fence alone cost more than five million dollars—the most unsettling defence deployed for the summit is one which has received far less public attention.,Individuals who breach a five-metre zone around the security fence may be asked to provide identification and explain the intent of their visit to police. Those who fail to comply can be searched without a warrant, fined five hundred dollars and spend up to two months in jail. These powers are granted to police by the Public Works Act, a piece of provincial legislation passed June 2 by Queen’s Park. The Act also states that testimony given in court by security personnel will be treated as “conclusive evidence.” While many fear that their right to peaceful protest is trampled, the violent history of previous G20 summits makes the erection of the fence a valid safety measure; security staff must err on the side of excessive protection.,Some of the G20 security measures are harder to defend. Though the new police powers only apply for the duration of the G20 summit, the speed and subtlety with which they were enacted sets a troublesome precedent. What prevents the authorities from enacting these restrictions for lesser events, or even to shut down entire cities?,Furthermore, the secrecy with which the regulations were enacted has put the public in harm’s way. The rules aren’t clearly indicated around the G20 site; some individuals who were unaware of the Act have been arrested after attempting to invoke their rights. Police statements already carry more weight than public testimony in the legal system. Making the word of a security officer de facto evidence makes it nearly impossible for an accused individual to mount a defence in court. The Public Works Act allows on the spot conviction of the public by police and security officials.,Though the conclusion of the G20 summit will dictate which security measures were necessary, the evidence will likely condone their application in either case. As this paper goes to press, rioters have already broken the windows of banks and stores, and set two police cars ablaze. Security forces will be quick to use these events as evidence that the existing protective measures were justified. Even if the summit protests had remained peaceful, many would have claimed that this was due to the new security measures. In either case, it seems likely that protective measures like those enacted in Toronto will become more common, not less."},{"title":"Charity needs clarity","url":"/story/2010-03-19/editorials/charity-needs-clarity/","date":"March 19, 2010","content":"A Liberal Member of Parliament is proposing a new private member’s bill that would require the five highest-paid executives of registered Canadian charities to publicly disclose their salaries, the Globe and Mail reported March 16.,Albina Guarnieri, the Liberal MP for Mississauga East—Cooksville, created the bill hoping it would help Canadians make more informed decisions about where to donate their money.,The proposed bill also sets a $250,000 cap on salaries for the senior executives of registered Canadian charities and requests that charities exceeding this payout be officially deregistered.,Guarnieri cites costs like golf club memberships, dining out and business class travel among the ways in which some of the 85,000 registered charities in Canada currently “spend money on themselves.”,The charity transparency bill is a promising proposition. It can be difficult to track how dollars donated to charities are spent, and it’s surprising a transparency bill relating to top salaries hasn’t appeared until now.,It’s in donors’ best interests to know where their money is going, and disclosing top executives’ salaries is a simple step that would go a long way towards accountability.,It’s unlikely the bill, if passed, will result in any significant decrease in how much Canadians donate to charity. Rather, charities are more likely to use their public accountability as a selling point in order to rake in more donations.,If the proposed bill comes into effect, donors shouldn’t fall into the trap of equating how much a charity’s top executive is paid with how much good his or her organization does. For some charities, the most effective way to bring about positive change may be through recruiting a high-quality, high-cost leader. Focusing on the larger question of accountability is more relevant than enforcing blanket salary caps.,Charities are corporate bodies, and racking up dinner bills and rounds of golf should be acknowledged as part of the business. In order to secure large donations, charities often need to make the relatively minute investment of dinner with a potential donor.,If not voluntarily or by good conscience, registered Canadian charities should be compelled by law to state where their money is going. Ideally, the bill would go further to address more than just the top five charity executives in Canada, but for now it should be appreciated as an incremental step towards transparency."},{"title":"Palin's mosque mess","url":"/story/2010-07-27/editorials/palinbs-mosque-mess/","date":"July 27, 2010","content":"Nearly ten years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the impending construction of a mosque threatens to ignite discrimination and religious intolerance in America.,The planned location of the mosque—only a few blocks from ground zero, the former site of the World Trade Center — has some up in arms, claiming that a Muslim site of worship has no place near one of the most hallowed sites in America.,Former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, was quick to contribute to the discussion, stating via Twitter that the planned mosque “stabs hearts” and is “UNNECESSARY provocation.”,Palin’s comments illustrate the Islamophobia some Americans endorse, influenced by—but not limited to—the 9/11 attacks. Many detractors insist that their concerns are not over the construction of the mosque itself, but rather its proximity to ground zero.,However, those who want the area around ground zero to become in essence a “Muslim-free zone,” fail to recognize that the 9/11 attackers were terrorists who happened to be Muslims, not Muslims whohappened to be terrorists. This cognitive leap clearly escaped Ms. Palin, who directed her Twitter post to “Peace-seeking Muslims” only.,The controversy becomes even more embarrassing on Palin’s side when one acknowledges that those associated with the “Park51” project are welcoming their opponents with open arms. The project’s developer said she would like to see Palin visit the mosque during prayers, so that she might have a chance to appreciate that the mosque’s visitors are “just as American as she is.” The head of the project, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, is committed to inclusivity, having founded a non-profit organization that pushes to assert women’s rights in Islam, and encourages interfaith dialogue—some time before the terrorist attacks in 2001.,Those opposing the project insist that they are fighting an affront to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. In reality, they are perpetuating this affront upon another group of victims; the silent majority of Muslims and individuals perceived to be “Middle Eastern,” who have faced discrimination and hate crimes in the period following the 9/11 attacks. Palin and her ilk must recognize that while few Muslims are terrorists, many Muslims are Americans.,If Palin and her followers are proud of the freedom of religion that America offers, they must also learn to uphold it."},{"title":"Facebook’s ad-mad lad","url":"/story/2010-05-18/editorials/facebooks-ad-mad-lad/","date":"May 18, 2010","content":"On April 21, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the social networking site’s latest gimmick, one which allows Facebook to engage with a user’s internet activity outside Facebook’s homepage. Websites that have partnered with Facebook can greet visitors with personalized content.,Furthermore, the infamous “like” button associated with Facebook’s various groups and applications has now moved beyond Facebook itself, appearing on comedy websites, blogs and online retail outlets. Facebook’s new features will provide external websites with enormous amounts of personal information about individual preferences and interests—information which Facebook can share freely.,Though Facebook’s vice-president of public policy, Elliot Schrage, has stated that the company doesn’t connect identities to shared information, a computer error—like that experienced by AOL in 2006—could make this information public at any time.,It’s difficult to imagine anyone being upset that they aren’t sharing more of their personal information with retailers.,By the same standard, many groups insist that Facebook’s dissemination of personal information should be an “opt-in” rather than an “opt-out” program. Others have criticized Facebook’s resetting of users’ privacy preferences with\neach new incarnation.,Though Facebook has become an integral social tool, it’s important to remember that it is still a business, seeking to maximize profits. As Facebook has become more popular, the amount of information a user is required to make publically accessible has slowly increased. While Schrage insists\nthat this is in order to “facilitate the kind of experience people come to Facebook to have,” this process also facilitates Facebook’s development as an advertising tool.,While Facebook should endeavour to be more transparent about their usage of personal information, it’s already clear they’re reluctant to accept this responsibility; Schrage was also quick to sidestep a question about Facebook’s liability in the event any data was mishandled.,Technology pundits grumble that Facebook’s aggressive sharing of personal information and complicated privacy settings will eventually prompt the website’s downfall. As ambitious developers discuss and create privacy-oriented Facebook alternatives, it is possible that dissatisfied Facebook users will vote with their mice, rejecting the wholesale distribution of their marketing preferences.,For now however, the burden of protecting information on Facebook falls to the users themselves; until a viable alternative presents itself, Facebook is here to stay."},{"title":"“SUMO Showdown” offends","url":"/story/2010-04-01/editorials/sumo-showdown-offends/","date":"April 1, 2010","content":"On Tuesday, the National Post published an article about the AMS’s decision to cancel a Food Bank fundraiser called the “SUMO Showdown” that would have made use of two sumo wrestling suits.,The suits, oversized plastic costumes designed to mimic the ancient Japanese sport of sumo wrestling, are yellow-tinted and include helmets with structures resembling black buns of hair on top.,Upon hearing from a group of deeply offended students, the AMS published a two-page apology letter on their website and cancelled the fundraiser altogether.,The apology letter said having students wear sumo suits “appropriates an aspect of Japanese culture” and “turns a racial identity in a costume.” The letter further states use of the suits “devalues an ancient and respected Japanese sport, which is rich in history and cultural tradition” and apologizes for the student government’s failure to consider potential racist meanings behind the use of the suits.,The sumo suits are owned by the Athletics Department and have been used in the past at sporting events like halftime shows at football games. Mike Grobe, speaking on behalf of Athletics, said no complaint had previously been brought to his attention about offensive aspects of the sumo suits.,The Post quotes AMS communications officer Brandon Sloan as having identified “white privilege” as a factor that made the student government blind to the gravity of the issues implicated in using sumo suits.,The Post further states Queen’s “has a proud tradition of inclusivity” for being the first university in Canada to graduate a black student and for naming a campus bar after Alfred Pierce, who was the son of a runaway slave—but that current Queen’s students’ understanding of political correctness suffers from the school’s “reputation for drawing its student body from the privileged neighbourhoods of Toronto and Ottawa.”,The AMS’s mission statement is “to serve and represent the diversity of students at Queen’s.” This is the Society’s mandate, so it follows that any event that marginalizes a group of Queen’s students would represent a deviation from the mission and a failure to be inclusive.,If students feel discriminated against by a course of action the student government intends to take, it’s reasonable to consider the potentially oppressive aspects of the initiative.,The AMS should be commended for their quick response to concerns that surfaced after the “SUMO Showdown” event was posted on Facebook. The AMS’s course of action in quickly drafting an apology letter shows thoughtfulness and tact.,After giving the issue some consideration, students and the broader media should see how sumo suits can be construed as offensive. The helmet is problematic for its mockery of traditional sumo hairstyles, while the coloured tint of the suits can also be seen as appropriation.,The costumes are a caricature of a noble, culturally meaningful sport and as such, they are offensive.,The suits’ comedic effect is tied largely to their size rather than their cultural aspects, but the line is easily blurred. It’s inappropriate to go forward with an event that could be misconstrued as mocking a cultural identity.,It’s also out of line to suggest that groups of people shouldn’t take offence to issues such as these. People naturally have different degrees of internal connection to what is being satirized and have little choice how they feel about racial mockery. The harm caused by this event is troubling, but the ensuing discussion invites thought about the potentially harmful implications that linger beneath the surface of culturally accepted things like sumo suits.,The Post’s treatment of the issue is deplorable for its willingness to tie this event, which was handled quickly and responsibly, to the issue of systemic racism, and also for its readiness to capitalize on loaded terminology like “white privilege.” The AMS discussed “privilege” in their apology letter, but never used the term “white privilege.”,Examples the Post invokes from Queen’s distant past are largely irrelevant to the current problem. By posting the article online beside links to articles addressing issues of free speech at universities, the Post misread this situation.,The sumo suit issue is not one of free speech, but rather a misguided choice made about an event that was meant to be fun.,Featuring the article on the Post’s front page also sensationalizes the issue. Sumo suits hardly qualify as national news.,By quickly formulating a thoughtful apology rather than a recycled statement, the AMS demonstrated a real desire to understand the issues brought forth and a strong focus on continued dialogue.,It’s clear the plan to use sumo suits in a fundraising event was hurtful to a group of Queen’s students. Othering and oppression is not the business of a responsible student government. We can be proud that the AMS, unlike the Post, has its priorities straight."},{"title":"The scourge of anonymity","url":"/story/2010-03-19/editorials/scourge-anonymity/","date":"March 19, 2010","content":"The newspaper’s gradual shift toward web-based content has some huge implications, the largest of which is that news coverage has become a two-way street.,Instead of reading a news story and then putting the paper down to sip their coffee, people can react immediately by posting comments online in response to the story or to other people’s comments.,Most news websites, including the Journal’s, allow users to comment anonymously. As one of the two people responsible for moderating the Journal’s comment boards, I can say with certainty that this is both a blessing and a curse.,Comment boards have the potential for great discussion. Critically examining a news story, responding to an opinion piece or adding some information to a blog post creates unprecedented access and capacity for interaction.,Unfortunately, this blessing is the exception that proves the rule. Many of these discussions are hijacked by the scourge that is anonymous commentary.,If you really want to lose faith in humanity, read almost any comment thread on the CBC or Globe and Mail website. Instead of crafting a well-written, thoughtful response to an issue, your average anonymous commenter often contributes counterproductive, fallacious and entirely inappropriate thoughts to a discussion.,Letters to the editor, the online comment’s predecessor, took time to write and cost money to mail. People took them seriously.,The Internet changed all that. Comments that tend to drag conversation down to a horrifyingly base level are most often posted anonymously. That isn’t always the case, but it’s a general rule.,The Journal, the campus newspaper at one of the country’s best post-secondary institutions, is no different.,The easy solution to this problem would be to ban anonymous comments, but it’s a tough situation. If you disallow anonymous comments, you’re stifling discussion. But if you allow them, you end up with boneheads spouting off with no idea what they’re talking about.,Allowing anonymous commentary is a fine line between encouraging discussion and encouraging cowardice.,After reading and moderating hundreds upon hundreds of comments this year, I’ve learned to disregard the anonymous ones. If commenters really stood behind their words, they wouldn’t hesitate to use their names.,For some reason, people seem to give anonymous commenters some merit. But I hope that as the public learns to deal with the Internet’s vast information database by filtering out the crap, anonymous commenters will soon be preaching to deaf ears.,There’s an expression that if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. That can’t be directly applied to anonymous commenters, but here’s a new version: If you’re not willing to put your name on it, keep it to yourself. You’re wasting everyone’s time.,I’m expecting a few smart-ass anonymous comments on this. If you’re tempted, go ahead. I won’t take you seriously anyway."},{"title":"A reminder to be kinder","url":"/story/2010-05-18/editorials/reminder-be-kinder/","date":"May 18, 2010","content":"Being nice is underrated.

Some crazy little thing came to give me my mandatory orientation.\nShe pointed at the treadmill.\n“That’s the treadmill,” she said\nwith “enthusiasm.”\nShe pointed at the class schedule.\n“That’s the class schedule,” she said, with even more “enthusiasm.”\nA great tour!\nWe sat back down and she essentially told me it was time to open my wallet.\nI asked for a student deal.\n“It doesn’t exist,” she said.\nIt does.\nI asked for a trial period.\n“It doesn’t exist,” she said.\nIt does.\nFinally, she “bent the rules” for me and gave me a seven-day trial and I hightailed it out of there, vowing never to return again.\nWhy couldn’t she have been attentive, maybe even … nice? She had tried to guilt me into signing-up right away, telling me that I would lose the offer, and that it was just plain lazy to get a trial first.\nI think nice must have gotten a bad rep.\nEveryone says the nice guy finishes last, but I don’t believe it for a second.\nBecause I’m a nice girl I can get away with things no one else can. If I stir the pot I can be assured someone else will be blamed for it—it’s kind of, well, nice.\nThe downside is that as soon as I start talking to someone, crazy little thing at the gym included, their nice-radar goes off. Once that happens, people get the idea in their heads that I can be pushed around and walked all over but that’s just\none big delusion.\nAs a nice girl, it may take me a few extra minutes to word my refusal to avoid hurting your feelings, but I’m not afraid to say no. People are often shocked to hear me assert myself, but they always back down when I take a stand.\nThe thing is, there are a lot of misconceptions about what being nice means. I think we fear that being nice will get us trampled, but nice isn’t necessarily sweet and it definitely isn’t passive or girly.\nBeing nice, like tear-free shampoo, does the job without the tears.

Twitter also helped—watching my tiny laptop screen light up with a new tweet was often much more entertaining and interesting than watching my TV set. Forty-one million people in the U.S. watched the 2010 Oscars—the largest audience for the awards since 2005—and I have no idea why.,It’s hard for me to articulate just what was wrong with the Academy Awards this year. There was such a lack of energy. Dull, flat jokes by two aging hosts, the lacklustre musical and dance performances and the even more dreary speeches almost made me turn off the television. This year, the Oscars were like an elaborate car crash that I couldn’t look away from. Neither could 41 million other people.,The show did have some lovely and legitimately amusing bits. George Clooney’s soured expression and non-English speaking girlfriend looked like parodies of themselves. The John Hughes tribute was heartfelt and seeing the aging members of the brat pack was both disheartening and entertaining. I was upset at the absence of my high-school crush Andrew McCarthy in the tribute, though I’m almost positive he wasn’t busy. But these minor parts of the show were overshadowed by the bad. James Taylor singing “All My Life”? Really?,Kathryn Bigelow’s Best Director win was also another point of contention, not because it wasn’t well-deserved, but because the only thing people seem to be talking about is the fact the Best Director winner is a woman. They seem to be forgetting her film, The Hurt Locker.,Oscar’s obsession with making history is just plain annoying and the self-congratulatory tone is even worse. Bigelow was only the fourth woman to be nominated for Best Director in the Oscars’ 82-year history. Perhaps a woman might have won much earlier if Oscar made an effort to pay attention to the films women have been making. The Hurt Locker was actually released in 2008—better late than never, I guess.,Before one commercial break, that disembodied voice of the Oscars was quick to point out that “Oscar history” could be made because an African-American man or a woman could win the Best Director award.,Barbara Streisand’s smug face and unnecessary comment upon opening the envelope—“Well, the time has come”— before announcing Bigelow’s name took away from the win. There are hundreds of amazing directors working in film, who also happen to be women, who would rather be regarded as filmmakers than “female filmmakers.” Our hyper self-consciousness and preoccupation with the fact that women, too, are directors, is my problem. Of course women can direct movies. Let’s just accept that and move on. When it was over, I couldn’t help but think the Academy Awards will always give us a snapshot of the American mood, however strange it may be, but never a gripping outlook on what’s happening in the rest of the world of cinema. For that, I guess we’ll have to search on our own."},{"title":"Professors: priceless","url":"/story/2010-04-01/editorials/professors-priceless/","date":"April 1, 2010","content":"Last week, one of my professors took the first five minutes of class to gauge students’ opinions on the proposed changes to the English department’s curriculum. An hour later the class was still talking, and had opened up to a larger discussion about Queen’s academic future.,The University’s latest round of academic planning got me thinking about the changing role of professors at post-secondary institutions. Yes, professors. Remember them? They’re the people with PhDs who arguably have the biggest effect on students’ university educations. And in case you haven’t noticed, larger classes, diminishing course options and the mounting pressure to publish has, in some cases, restricted professors’ ability to actually teach students.,Admittedly, I’m a jaded fourth-year student in the last two weeks of my undergraduate education. However, one thing I can say without hesitation is that when it comes to higher learning, having good professors was one of the things that kept me from dropping out of this somewhat stodgy institution.,I spent a lot of time during my first two years at Queen’s asleep in the back of lecture halls barely listening to certain professors mechanically pump out lectures for an hour and 20 minutes before disappearing into a sea of 200-plus students. I’ve also been incredibly lucky over my last two years at Queen’s to have thoughtful, interesting professors who have salvaged my faith in academia.,This doesn’t necessarily have to do with age or experience. I’ve had classes taught by older-than-water tenured professors that lacked any discernable interesting structure, and classes taught by PhD candidates with zero teaching experience that I’ve loved—and vice versa.,Whether it’s a first-year course with more than 300 people or a smaller niche seminar course where only 10 people routinely show up, a good professor makes the difference between robotically going to a class and actually caring about—or, dare I say, engaging with—the course material.,Amidst the other complex issues Principal Daniel Woolf and his constituents have to consider, I urge them to take a step back and remember the professors who do the academic grunt work day in and day out.,Mega-gyms and impressive student centres are great, but not necessarily at the expense of forsaking the resources of the people Queen’s relies on to disseminate information. Remember, the first classes at Queen’s were held with 13 students and two professors. I’m not suggesting we go back to 1842, but taking the time to remember Queen’s was established as a place for people to teach other people might help to reign academic values back towards where they should be.,The possibilities of virtualization, interdisciplinary study and alternative modes of learning are important avenues to explore to protect Queen’s academic future, but investing in professors who still genuinely enjoy teaching is priceless. Woolf should understand—after all, he’s a professor too. When it comes to keeping Queen’s securely at the top of the academic ladder, you only get out what you put in."},{"title":"Fast forward","url":"/story/2010-04-08/editorials/fast-forward/","date":"April 8, 2010","content":"Last week, I read about an impossible feat. The Globe and Mail interviewed Sean Aiken, the author of One-Week Job. Aiken, a business school graduate, wrote about his experiences working 52 jobs in 52 weeks—one job for every week of the year.,Besides thinking about how great all his experiences must have been and the fact that he donated all his earnings to charity, I had to think, how the heck did this guy manage to get 52 jobs?,This seems close to impossible, especially considering the stress many of my peers and I face each year just to find one summer job. It’s the last week of classes, and as a result everyone seems to be preoccupied with how they will spend their time after exams are over.,In a way, Aiken’s experience was the perfect resumé builder; who wouldn’t want 52 different jobs to show off to future employers?,Close to everything we do seems to contribute to our competitive edge in the job market as many students are constantly working, volunteering and joining countless extracurricular activities. Once we arrive on campus after Reading Week, everyone seems to be dusting off their resumés and asking how they will spend the upcoming summer break. Upon thinking about what the heck I was going to do this summer, I realized we have constantly been questioned about our futures.,From the “What do you want to be when you grow up?” question in elementary school to the “Which university will you go to?” question in high school to the present “What will you major in and what do you want to do with that?” question, thinking about the future even a few months ahead becomes stressful.,My anxiety doesn’t cease when everyone from my cab driver to my bank advisor seems to be asking about my summer employment plans. All these questions spur me into thinking I constantly have to be doing something, that if those four long months of summer break aren’t spent doing something productive that—what, exactly? Will the world end?,So I had to think: If I had all the time in the world and no obligations, what would I want to do? Would I go on a road trip to a random city with my friends? Go bungee jumping? Learn to scuba dive? I’m a lot less anxious thinking about that than about when I will hear back from potential employers, if at all.,Maybe instead of feeding our anxiety, we should focus on what we want to accomplish during our summer break instead of what we think we have to accomplish. I don’t think worrying about getting a summer job is going to get me one any faster.,Besides, if Sean Aiken can get a job every week of the year, maybe there’s hope for the rest of us.,If not, then I’m sure my future book, One-Week Slob, will be a bestseller.

Big stories need to be reported on before they turn stale, or someone else gets the scoop.,As citizen journalism and blogging mature and become competing forces for readership, newspapers are racing to be first to report. These competitors have the motivation to report the story with little compensation and the ability to report with low-cost. All you need is a mobile phone, free or cheap web hosting and a Twitter account.,Google has put everyone on a level playing field. A search is just as likely to return a blog post as a newspaper article. A search for a topic on Twitter will get you anybody’s opinion.,To avoid missing the opportunity to catch those eyeballs and sell more advertising, newspapers have adopted the live-blog, Twitter and the RSS feed to get information out to their readers as quickly as possible, who seem to lap it right up.,The problem with being first is that first can also be wrong, or at least wrong by omission.,Look no further than the mass of G20 reporting from last weekend. The Toronto Star’s Twitter page and live-blogs are wastelands of lazy copy editing and vague information. It’s clear that reporters were posting directly to the site from the chaotic streets without an editor’s second glance.,But what really bothered me was the lack of a clear perspective. For all the TwitPics of busted windows and black-clad protestors, there were no accounts of how many windows were really broken and how many protestors were throwing bricks.,There is too much reporting on the ‘what’, and not enough of the ‘why’, ‘who’ and ‘how’.,The last bastion of solid, in-depth reporting is news magazines like Maclean’s, the Walrus, and the New Yorker. Their production schedules force them to go deep, and play to that strength, since there’s no way they can be first.,When I’m feeling like reading some good journalism, the articles that get bookmarked or put into the genius Instapaper iPhone app (it strips away all the ads and saves articles and blog posts in a readable format to read later) are tending to be longer and longer. Nothing compares to an article by a reporter who has had months to research its subject.,The downside of this kind of writing is that it’s expensive. The cost of sending a writer to remote locations to interview important people can be prohibitive, but the payoff can be huge. For example, Rolling Stone gained lots of readership for their feature on General Stanley McChrystal. The article resulted in President Obama relieving him of his command of American forces in Afghanistan.,Newspapers are allotting a huge proportion of their resources to live-blogs and Twitter but are fighting a losing battle--other people are doing it for free.

In the past, Empress Magazine’s fee has been resoundingly rejected. But the Queen’s Students for Literacy fee passed with 70 per cent of the vote.,Do you see a discrepancy here?,I work at the most visible source of campus news at Queen’s but, frankly, I’m tired of the Journal’s monopoly on news reporting.,The short-lived but well-intentioned blog fthejournal.wordpress.com caught my attention earlier this year, at first with its misnomer but later with its manifesto points.,Despite feeling misrepresented by many of its claims, I think the bloggers made some good points.,A single news source won’t capture all the issues or cover all of the events that take place on campus because, let’s face it, it’s overworked and underfunded.,That’s different from saying the Journal’s not doing a good job with the limited resources it has. But alternative news sources need to step it up and fill in the gaps.,This campus needs magazines, perhaps another newspaper, blogs, stronger radio and TV programs to create multiple outlets for student expression.,I read about mature women students’ experiences on campus and reports being compiled by the University on this topic through the arts magazine Queen’s Feminist Review last week. Humour newspaper Golden Words broke a story about misplaced AMS employee T4 forms last year. I’ve read Ultraviolet and Syndicus to get a feel for issues students are interested in.,These media are informative, educational and engaging. They form a necessary counterpart to the Journal but, ideally, exist as more than just opposition to it—despite what fthejournal would have you believe.,In an ideal situation, the growing number and strength of alternative publications would eventually break the mainstream-alternative divide and each publication would become a primary news source to students. The publications would keep each other in check, share news tips (or not), offer competing perspectives and bring up topics they felt other publications were ignoring.,Here’s a wild idea: having enough resources to have multiple media reporting on the same event. Boisterous media scrum, anyone? If we want a critical, engaged student body, we need to put our money where our mouth is.,Queen’s has a solid base of alternative media but many of these news outlets have lost a significant portion of their funding because their opt-outable fees didn’t pass.

But on Monday, Rochette withdrew from the World Figure Skating Championships which take place next week in Turin, Italy. Rochette cites tough emotional circumstances and missed training time as reasons for withdrawing.,The International Skating Union (ISU) originally condemned Rochette for breaching the Union’s rules with her plans to go ahead with the tribute while withdrawing from a major competition. The ISU had planned to implement punitive measures for Rochette, stating she wouldn’t be permitted to compete in any ISU-sanctioned events in the future.,A day later, the ISU agreed to acknowledge Rochette’s “unique and extenuating circumstances” and avoid punishing her.,Rochette’s choice is legitimate given her circumstances. There’s a significant difference between the exhibition environment of an ABC made-for-TV tribute and the competitive grind of national competition. Rochette demonstrated foresight in recognizing she would be unable to enter the World Championships with a polished enough routine to give the sport the respect it deserves.,The ISU did well to reconsider their insensitive threat of punitive measures in this case and instead seek to understand why Rochette wouldn’t want to compete.,This kind of behaviour is encouraging from an international sporting body, as they often have a pattern of tactlessness—for instance, the Togo soccer team was banned from the next two African Nations Cup competitions after withdrawing from this year’s tournament when their team bus was attacked. During the attack, the team’s press officer and assistant coach were killed.,In Rochette’s case, the ISU’s decision to apply rules with nuance and consideration for personal circumstances is more laudable.,While it would be wrong to allow a complete breach of their rules without explanation, the ISU did well to acknowledge Rochette’s situation as a rare exception without fearing that a harmful precedent might be set."},{"title":"Rock on, Rogue","url":"/story/2010-03-26/editorials/rock-rogue/","date":"March 26, 2010","content":"Last Thursday in the Queen’s Centre a small group of students made an alternative fashion statement with “Rogue,” a fun and fearless show designed to challenge mainstream norms of body image and gender identity, among others.,The event was inspired by a similar show at York University and was created to speak back to representations of fashion, identity and the body portrayed in performances like Vogue Charity Fashion Show.,Rogue participants were quick to say their guerilla-type exhibition wasn’t intended as a specific attack on Vogue, but as a critique of the larger culture of conventional fashion.,Rogue was successful in its attempt to create a positive fashion statement and to raise important ideas like pride in one’s own unique appearance and identity. Rogue is a sterling example of student initiative being channeled into something impactful and different.,Rogue’s response to mainstream fashion is pointed and valid. In productions where a selection committee decides which models fit with their image, there’s little opportunity to create an inclusive space.,Rogue’s mandate to promote different standards of beauty at Queen’s speaks to the fact that many students feel excluded from what is considered normal.,Rather than setting a negative tone, Rogue established a spontaneous, feel-good spirit. The demonstration included some direct mockery of mainstream fashion trends like Lululemon pants and Ugg boots, but this was done in a satirical, tongue-in-cheek way.,The clear wordplay in Rogue’s name easily invokes the Vogue show, but it’s unfortunate many Vogue supporters are taking offence rather than seeing the ensuing dialogue as constructive.,It’s important to recognize Rogue was intended as a dialogic response to normative fashion culture rather than a malicious attack on Vogue’s charity initiatives.,Vogue is the most popular and visible fashion show at Queen’s, and as such it received the brunt of Rogue’s passion. Responding in a divisive way to such a positive display is an unproductive response to an initiative whose very mandate is inclusion.,Rogue was a great use of the Queen’s Centre and one of the most celebratory and upbeat demonstrations the school has seen recently.

A push for non-religious alternatives in Manitoba would be a positive step.,But it’s also important for non-religious patients to maintain an open mind when entering treatment programs and to not simply reject important self-reflective phases of the process because they bear loaded labels like “spirituality.”,It would be misguided to assume people who struggle with addictions are unstable because they lack a connection with a higher power, but religion can play a powerful role in the recovery process if a patient is willing.,Downright dismissal of faith-based rehab centres is unproductive. These systems do a lot of good. But it’s important for alcoholics to have the choice of which treatment method meshes best with their personal beliefs.,Johnston makes an important point about addicts’ vulnerability at the point they seek treatment. Forcing religious elements on unwilling patients is exploitative, especially because these people have addictive personalities and are likely to grasp onto whatever aid they are offered.,Many established rehab programs happen to contain essential elements that liken them to organized religions, including a central manual, emphasis on indoctrination and the importance of having faith in the system.,It would be beneficial to offer treatment options with fewer religious connotations, especially if this is a concern preventing other addicts from seeking treatment. Religion can play a very useful role in the recovery process, but creating some more secular options in Manitoba wouldn’t hurt."},{"title":"Host country not to blame","url":"/story/2010-02-18/editorials/host-country-not-blame/","date":"February 18, 2010","content":"British media outlets like the Daily Mail and the Guardian are criticizing Canada for being a poor Olympic host, CBC News reported Feb. 15.,The Daily Mail places the blame on Canada for the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died during a practice run in Whistler, British Columbia on what has been called one of the world’s fastest and most difficult luge tracks.,Officials from the International Luge Federation concluded the accident was caused by human error rather than problems with the track, despite the fact that the track was altered for safety reasons after the tragedy.,It’s a misrepresentation to say Canada is to blame for Kumaritashvili’s accident. The luger’s death was brought about by human error rather than malicious intent. The track in Whistler was designed with input from professionals in countries other than Canada and was built by a German, Udo Gurgel.,No country should shoulder the blame for Kumaritashvili’s death. The incident should be taken at face value as a tragedy for which it’s impossible and unnecessary to place blame. The global community can learn form this incident going forward, rather than pointing fingers at Canada. It’s a call to look for ways to ensure safety in the Games.,It’s also naïve to suggest there’s no risk to luging. Olympic athletes want to compete in the most challenging facilities, and to critique the Vancouver Games’ organizers and engineers for delivering competitive quality is misguided.,Some of the British media’s other criticisms of Canada’s Olympic hosting are valid. Hosting the Games was a good opportunity for Canada to showcase the nation’s capabilities, but several glitches suggest we’re falling short. The mechanical failure of the main torch structure during the Opening Ceremonies provided an opportunity for Canada to be mocked on the world stage.,Complaints about there not being ample snow at Cypress and Whistler are legitimate, but weather problems are hardly the fault of a host city’s people.,It’s likely British media is coming down hard on Vancouver because London would like an easy act to follow when their turn to host the Games comes in 2012.,The Olympics generate nationalism, for better or for worse.

Recent discovery of private draft copies has revealed the fact that Kenney struck out sections pertaining to gay rights.,Kenney’s spokesman stated the choice was made in an effort to curtail the guide. The previous publication of Discover Canada, produced in 1995, contained no mention of any kind of marriage.,On Wednesday, Kenney—who has been a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage—denied crossing out the sections.,Material outlining gay rights is an important guide of any citizen’s guide to Canada, and should have been included in the document.,Regardless of whether Kenney’s motive was political or simply meant to conserve space, he was misguided in removing these sections.,The few brief clauses addressing gay rights in the earlier edition of Discover Canada pointed out essential information, such as the fact that it’s illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation in Canada. Many immigrants are coming from countries where this may not be the case and it’s important to bring them up to speed with the expectations of our laws.,Kenney’s choice wasn’t just a neglectful omission, but an active removal of content. As a political leader, Kenney is expected to push his own partisan agenda. But it’s discouraging our national citizenship guide reflects his deliberate omission, given Canada’s wider reputation as a country that embraces diversity and acceptance.,Facts about gay rights need not be included in the guide in a self-congratulatory way, nor should Canadians parade the fact that same-sex marriage is legalized here as a way to prize our ethical advancement. Issues of homophobia are still unfortunately common, despite legal progress.

Since then, over 10,900 troops have been let go due to their sexual orientation.,It’s upsetting the U.S. forces continue to systematically exclude personnel who are openly gay. Especially considering U.S. forces are currently involved in two major combat operations, they can’t afford to deny any willing troops.,The ban’s only merits are to reduce potential distraction for soldiers and to quash the mockery that might be associated with coming out as a homosexual in the army. But it’s high time to repeal the archaic ban that makes the American military seem discriminatory and homophobic.,Being unable to discuss one’s personal life or romantic partner with colleagues out of the fear of being expelled from the army is unnecessarily burdensome.,The “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy was considered progressive when it was implemented by Bill Clinton in 1993, but times and social perceptions have changed for the better. The U.S. military is taking a necessary and positive step towards equity.,Pledging to repeal the ban on gay troops was one of Obama’s main mandates when elected, and it’s encouraging his State of the Union speech last week touched on the topic. But the fact it took him a year to address the issue is disheartening.,It’s also surprising a plan to revoke the ban on gay personnel in the military is still a contentious issue. Equity regardless of sexual orientation is a mandate that shouldn’t have to be argued. In any other industry, it’s unlikely a similar level of debate on the issue of homosexual rights would exist.,Banning openly gay troops from the U.S. forces is an outdated mentality and it’s time the ban were overturned.

We’re each other’s peers, and we’re supposed to be in this together. But more and more frequently I’m noticing students turning down their classmates’ requests for notes from that lecture they missed last Friday. What’s the big deal, guys?,But, the diligent note-hoarder counters, they’re the ones who attended the class. They showed up while you were sick/frantically writing a paper for another class/hung over as all hell. They put in the time and you didn’t.,This is true.,But let’s think about it. The act of note-taking involves little to no work; you effectively sit in a room and write down the words of someone more intelligent than you. You don’t own the knowledge. Nobody is going to the professor and asking for make-up notes.,Realistically, someone who was absent from class isn’t going to benefit from second-hand notes to any great degree.,Robbed of its context, “-Freudian analysis of King Arthur character” doesn’t mean much, and will provide only the most basic assistance in the absentee’s quest to understand whatever they’ve missed.,Similarly, any participation component included in the grading scheme of the course has already cost the skipper some marks, so they’re likely heading into the final exam with a diminished average.,But what’s wrong with helping a classmate succeed academically? Are we so Machiavellian that we want to see our colleagues fail? Surely there will be some point in the note withholder’s academic career where they will indeed also miss class—an environmental disaster, perhaps? Being held at gun point?—and they will find the tables turned. Do they expect a similarly harsh refusal?,I owe a great deal of my success in a recent history course to a kind benefactor who sent me a last minute package of his study notes. He asked for nothing in return and didn’t gain anything from sending them to me. And although he finished the course with a mark two per cent higher than my own, I did pretty well in my own right, and couldn’t have done it without him.,If a friend needs to borrow my notes, they’re more than welcome to them.

But as many schools in the U.S. move ahead to implement merit pay for teachers, Canadian educators are warming to discussions of its effectiveness.,It’s beneficial to bring new ideas on education reform to the table, but introducing a merit-based pay system for teachers in Canada isn’t the best way to go about improving our country’s schools.,Putting energy and creativity into lesson plans and classroom instruction are the basic requirements of a teacher’s job. Educators should be able to achieve this level of care without school boards having to resort to a system of merit pay.,It’s unlikely introducing merit pay would improve the quality of learning in schools. Having teachers vie for the prize of merit pay might threaten a congenial workplace culture by causing competition or by making co-workers less willing to share good ideas.,Level of education and years of experience are currently considered the main indicators of a teacher’s salary, but these measurements don’t always point to the best educators.,A teacher’s character and energy can’t be measured in dollars. It’s difficult to quantify a teacher’s performance and to objectively determine what attributes or classroom results define a good educator. Quality instruction can come in the form of students’ higher test scores, but also includes the life lessons students learn or the confidence they develop.,Introducing a merit element to teachers’ pay system in Canada would also reinforce the skewed idea that it’s acceptable to have different standards of education in different classrooms.,In Canada, we’re lucky to have a group of high-quality teachers who generally receive too little pay for a highly-respected and important profession. It’s time to reward teachers for their work with higher pay all around.,A more effective way to strengthen the level of teaching in Canada’s classrooms would be to develop and lengthen teacher’s college programs.,Those who pursue a career in teaching should have a strong desire to impart knowledge on young people while aiding in their development and socialization.,If this desire is lacking from the start, it seems unlikely that merit pay will be a strong enough catalyst to foster its growth."},{"title":"Research helps, not harms","url":"/story/2010-02-12/editorials/research-helps-not-harms/","date":"February 12, 2010","content":"Recent tests run by scientists from the University of California, Berkeley show that toxins released by cigarette smoke can pose a danger when they linger on clothing and furniture, BBC News reported Feb. 9.,The Berkeley researchers report having found “substantial levels” of dangerous toxins called tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) on surfaces that were exposed to “high but reasonable” amounts of pollutant.,Pioneers of the study have labelled the residue of cigarette toxins on clothing and furniture “third-hand smoke” and have suggested banning smoking inside homes and cars.,Simon Clark, director of a smokers’ lobby group called Forest, said publicizing the new results only generates alarm and that “scientists and campaigners should resist the urge to tell us how to live our lives.”,Public awareness of the Berkeley study’s results and circulation of the term “third-hand smoke” will likely increase the culture of fear surrounding smoking. But the fact that nicotine clings to smokers’ clothing and furniture is nothing we haven’t heard or smelled before.,Assigning the label “third-hand smoke” makes the study’s results jump off the page and incite more fear than if the nicotine residue were to be discussed using less charged terminology. But without the sense of urgency that comes with the term “third-hand smoke,” it’s unlikely these important research results would garner the same level of discussion.,It’s a personal choice whether or not to smoke, but people have less of a choice when it comes to being around cigarette smoke. The study’s results bring to light what has been common sense for some time: when sharing a home with children or other individuals who choose not to smoke, it’s respectful to keep the nicotine outside.,There’s nothing amiss with scientists trying to influence our health choices through their research. In the past, much good has come of health research initiatives. Many positive strides have been made in anti-smoking legislation, including the ban on smoking inside bars and restaurants.,It would be hasty to accept the Berkeley study as cause to introduce legislation against smoking in one’s own home.

Vieria mistakenly called Betty Fox’s son Michael. Then a photo of the young Terry Fox, fading to a photo of Michael J.

NBC’s fact-checkers should have picked up on the difference between Terry Fox, who ran across the country on one leg in 1980 to raise funds for cancer research, and Michael J.

NBC wasn’t obligated to delve into Terry Fox’s history, but if a network chooses to cover an angle, they should be expected to do it right.,NBC’s error wasn’t just a slip of the tongue, but a categorical error with a flawed lineup of photos depicting two entirely different men. This incident demonstrates a stunning level of ignorance that doesn’t bode well for the remainder of NBC’s Olympic reporting.,In addition to being about the spirit of sport, the Olympic Games also aim to educate people about the host city and country.

This number was based on the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students, but the SGPS never formally agreed to contribute the funds.,SGPS Vice-President (Finance and Services) Amir Nosrat said the SGPS believes the University administration is purposely overlooking other graduate student issues, like increased residence space and teaching assistant rights, in order to provoke graduate and professional students’ payment for the Queen’s Centre.

I’d prefer to draw attention to the absurd nature of the debate.,While the Canadian broadcasters backing the “Local TV” campaign implore visitors of their website to “take action” by sending a message to their Member of Parliament, guests of stopthetvtax.ca are asked to “send a tax-o-gram to the CRTC.”,The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is the punching bag for both of these groups because it is ultimately the arbiter on the matter, subject to seldom-exercised federal oversight.,This debate isn’t centred around what’s best for consumers, but rather who can convince this supercilious regulator that their interests more fully serve those of the country.,The CRTC exists for the purpose of regulating and supervising Canada’s broadcasting and telecommunications systems.

So why is it so important for us as Canadians to see someone come out on top in a sport whose rules we may not even know?,Especially with these games taking place on Canadian soil, I’ve seen a renewed interest in Canada’s standings and medal count. Although this can be seen as support for our home and Canadian pride, I think it also comes down to Canada’s poor standings in past Olympic games.,Let’s face it. We’ve hosted three Olympic games and, up until Sunday night, we had not yet captured a gold medal on Canadian soil. The idea that Canada does so poorly in the summer and winter games, despite the high number of athletes we have competing, has become a sore spot for many Canadians and athletes alike.,The idea that we, as a nation with mountains and snow for most of the year, could not obtain a gold on home soil seems to have confused most of the country. However, when one looks at the root of the problem and why these standings are so low, one can only arrive at a single conclusion: funding.,What the Canadian Olympic team receives in funding from the government compared to American athletes in the same sports gives us an idea of why we end up so far down in the ranks when it comes time for our athletes to represent us in the games. Our athletes are content to train for hours on end with minimal funding and go out there and give it their best. But wouldn’t it be better if we stood behind them as a nation and gave them the tools they need to actually achieve victory?,Maybe if we, as a people, brought more support to the sports that we may not watch other than during the Olympics, it would be easier for these incredible athletes to beat someone on a level playing field.,Look at it this way: the sport we are known for at the Olympics—the sport in which we usually come out triumphant—is hockey. Canadian hockey players are paid millions of dollars in the NHL to train all year long, and concentrate only on hockey.,Imagine we gave as much support to someone in the biathlon event, or even cross-county skiing. How different would the outcome be then? Support for our Canadian athletes is an integral part of the games.

McLaren used an anecdote about a cruel boss to make the assertion that vegetarians are, by nature, cold-hearted, humanity-hating hypocrites. Vegetarianism, she said, is a “seriously unattractive character trait.”,McLaren’s column sums up most people’s reaction to vegetarianism: that is, it’s not the act of refraining from meat that is repulsive, but the label itself.,Having shied away from red meat for most of my life and given up meat entirely about five years ago, I’ve had to deal with my fair share of shocked reactions, strange questions and full outrage about my diet.,When I was 15, a teacher yelled at me for spitting out a bite of pizza that I realized all too late had a hidden layer of pepperoni under the cheese. “Stop being so sensitive,” he told me. “Meat won’t kill you!”,From questions like “But don’t you miss it?” to incredulous cries of, “Well that can’t be healthy! You must have a protein deficiency!” I’ve heard it all. There’s a definite stigma attached to vegetarianism, a stigma full of misguided stereotypes and false assumptions.,In my case, my dietary decision was determined simply by my dislike for meat. For many people, this seems to be a very difficult concept to grasp. There appears to be a popular belief that all vegetarians secretly love meat but uphold their vegetarianism simply as a political statement.,While this may be true for some, for me and many others I know the decision to stay away from meat has less to do with ethics and more to do with personal preference. Believe it or not, some people just don’t like the taste of flesh.,It’s not that I don’t love animals or recognize the often horrendous conditions of commercial farms, but I think the true sentiments of animal rights activism often get tainted by radical groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the image of vegetarianism they present in the media. PETA frequently objectifies women in their advertisements and has been known to compare human tragedies and deaths to the meat industry.,In 2008, after the Greyhound bus murder, PETA created an ad that compared the stabbing and beheading of Tim McLean and the alleged cannibalism of his murderer to the slaughter of animals for meat.,This kind of gross insensitivity shouldn’t be associated with all vegetarians or vegans, but because of widespread ignorance, it is.,As long as people continue to buy into false media portrayals of vegetarianism, misguided stereotypes like McLaren’s will continue to be the norm."},{"title":"Monotony, interrupted","url":"/story/2010-03-05/editorials/monotony-interrupted/","date":"March 5, 2010","content":"I’d be fucking boring to stalk.,To save anyone considering it the trouble, I’ve catalogued my day.

And since I can’t force myself to do something that will make people pull out their headphones and stop looking at the street on their way to campus, I’ll wait until someone does me that favour.,I’ve tried small measures. I’ve taken to running frantically past people when I’m in no rush to be anywhere. Some people get snide, but that’s not enough to justify the exertion.,There’s a force on this campus—and maybe even in mainstream society—that keeps people from doing bizarre things. Whether it’s modesty or rationality, someone needs to catch this beast and force it to wear a burlesque outfit.,Regardless of what’s causing the boredom, someone needs to interrupt the quiet walks with the occasional stop to talk and complain about midterms. If not, then it will continue to be normal.,One person choosing to wear a top hat on campus will make it easier for the next person because it will have been seen before.,This may be paradoxically monotonous to even write about. But one person walking naked would affect the way I walk on the street. I will never expect to see someone walking nude until I see it and it ceases to be bizarre.,Some people inch odd behaviour into the mainstream.

This was closely followed by the wholesome air of the ’80s, characterized by shows like Cheers and The Brady Bunch.,The ’90s followed with an uplifting comedy streak, sparking classic favourites like Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Friends, and creating memorable characters like the haphazard Steve Urkel and the dreamy Brandon Walsh of 90210.,These shows, succeeded by the new millennium’s craze for reality television, gave way to shows like Jersey Shore, Laguna Beach and the infamous Jon and Kate Plus 8—a show chronicling the lives of an American couple and their eight kids. In turn, these shows have created a Big Brother-like obsession in 21st century television—so prominent, in fact, that industry professionals created a show in its honour.,The shows we’re familiar with today no doubt deliver their promised entertainment value and our daily dose of celebrity pseudo-drama, but I often wonder about the volumes they will speak of our generation.,These shows are a sort of guilty pleasure—yet, as more and more of them air, they become widely unexpected hits. I am not advocating nostalgia or the lost value of television, nor do I want to moralize about the naïveté society has been said to lose.,But I do wonder what this trend, like any trend, means for society.,These shows revolutionized television. They took the creative power from men with typewriters and democratized it. Celebrity now belongs to people who could previously only idolize stars.,The ideas of hidden values—good or bad—and the purposeful creativity applied to developing plots, three-dimensional characters and comedic cues are significantly lessening. Viewers are given the power to draw their own values and laugh without audience cues.,It’s also interesting to look at the alleged truth-values of these shows. These reality TV shows, supposed to stream truthful, unscripted occurrences, have often been proven, to do just the opposite.,The reality of television, it seems, isn’t as dispensable as we think. When we’re clicking the remote to find the latest episode of The Real World: Brooklyn, we’re expecting real characters, unscripted events and uncharted territory. But television is rarely so candid.,Reality shows can be seen as a wider social occurrence, a constant need for connection with the lives of strangers.,In an unprecedented age of technology, politics, arts and entertainment, it seems we can orchestrate a choose-your-own-adventure of the reality we want to believe.

Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but from what I understand this system is supposed to be in place to award and celebrate the best music of the year.,After watching the festivities, I’m sad to report that it seems the award show has once again done its part to perpetuate the mainstream popularity and album sales of the same artists, labels and bands that continue to prevail year after year.,Yes, Beyoncé is undeniably fierce, “Use Somebody” tears at my heartstrings and Lady Gaga with Elton John almost made me pee my pants—until I saw Stevie Nicks. But, the irrelevance of the Grammys is becoming almost too painful to watch.,The fact that the show honours only a small and cherry-picked group of artists each year isn’t exactly an innovative realization. Stephen Colbert explained it honestly by confessing he was happy to help “celebrate our most precious right—the right of celebrities to congratulate each other.”,Don’t get me wrong. I genuinely enjoy a Cirque-de-Soleil-esque acrobatic number and Michael Jackson tribute as much as the next person and I’m the first to run to the dance floor when “Poker Face” or “Single Ladies” comes on.,This aside, I find myself wondering what the point of watching the Grammys is,anymore when some of the most talented and talked-about artists of the year are omitted entirely. This is especially concerning for me considering people’s tendency to coin 2009 as the year of indie music’s “arrival.”,I have to question who has arrived when I see Ke$ha covering herself in glitter and strutting down the red carpet while other artists like Uffie and Little Boots are seemingly banished away to the walls of the blogosphere. To be fair, I was pleasantly surprised to see French rockers Phoenix take home the best alternative album award for their Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, and found myself wondering if there could ever be a place for bands like Animal Collective, Grizzly Bear and Passion Pit to arrive in the mix outside of a unique venue like the Polaris Music Prize.,It’s important to take the Grammys for what they are: a show. Some stellar live performances, occasionally poignant acceptance speeches and the risk of a scandal make the broadcast, if begrudgingly, worth watching.,All I ask is that we also take the time to recognize the wide variety of musical achievement from last year.,Whether it’s through telling a classmate about a wicked new track or tweeting your favourite Kingston band some kudos—maybe we can bring music awards a little more down to earth."},{"title":"Time to ponder","url":"/story/2010-01-26/editorials/time-ponder/","date":"January 26, 2010","content":"As I drove towards the train station in Ottawa on Sunday, coming back to Kingston after a brief stint at home, my dad asked me how my search for summer jobs was going, reminding me that summer was a mere three months away. He then asked me how my search for a Masters program was going, reminding me that my last application is due in a few weeks.,It suddenly dawned on me that my undergraduate career was about to end. Being the over-analytical person I am, I started thinking about my time at Queen’s, from living on the all-men’s floor in Leonard in first year and going to the caf in a bathrobe, to attending Herstmonceux Castle during the summer, picking up 2.5 credits in 10 weeks and, well, going to the caf in a bathrobe.,Now I’m sitting in my 8:30 a.m. seminar, banging out this editorial and pretending to listen to my professor along with eight other people who are also doing laptop things, and I’m pondering the value of the last four years. What have I learned? How have I grown? What would past Amrits think of\ncurrent Amrit?\nIt’s an interesting train of thought I’m on, trying to figure out who I am compared to who I was. What constants have remained since high school? Since first year? Since second year, even?,I still love sports, always have, and probably always will. I started university with a staunch belief in the Conservative Party, but have since lost immense faith in party politics as a whole. I still think the AMS is largely irrelevant and doesn’t really reflect the wants of the students.,I think the one thing that will stick with me from Queen’s is the “racism.” Yes, I put racism in quotes, because I think a lot of the “racism” we’ve been whining about for the last two years has been blown so far out of proportion that we’ve all but degraded the word’s meaning.,When I was a kid and a teen, being called a racist was a very, very heavy accusation. You exercised extreme caution when using the word, and made absolutely certain that you had all your facts in place before using it.,Now, we throw it about so willy-nilly that it’s lost its weight. A friend of mine was called a racist last night because he supported a speech by Jason Kenney. I may not share all of our Immigration Minister’s views, but he has the right to his opinion as long as he doesn’t propagate hate, and people who go out to listen to them shouldn’t be blindly labelled as “racist.”,How dare we degrade such a heavy term to something we can throw around as an innocent taunt. It’s not a playground burn. It’s a word we need to refrain from using blindly before it completely loses\nits meaning.,It’s sad—I started writing this editorial with a smile on my face. Then I remembered how many claims of racism I’ve dealt with over the past two years, how many people have accused me of being a racist merely because I didn’t agree with them, and how little the word “racist” means now. And suddenly, I’m more sullen.

But tossing a pie in a speaker’s face is an unprofessional and ineffective alternative to expressing real dissatisfaction with words.,This spectacle only makes PETA look worse in the public eye, and does little to advance the ethical treatment of animals. While their cause is valuable, the way PETA presents their message is often not an effective way to spread civil awareness.,In this instance and many others, PETA’s publicity stunts go beyond activism to a level of destruction that does verge on terrorism.,Whether sexualizing women in the “I’d rather go naked than wear fur” campaign or creating an advertisement comparing a human beheading aboard a Greyhound bus to the decapitation of chickens, PETA constantly crosses the line and, in the process, undermines their message.,If PETA’s goal was to win a piece of the media share, their mission has been accomplished. But their pie-tossing is only another example of dishonourable tactics that ultimately jeopardize the weight of their message.,PETA’s actions could be described with many of the same phrases used to identity terrorism: they are acts intended to create fear that often disregard public safety and stem from an ideological motive.,But labeling PETA’s aggressive stunts with the same term used for more egregious destruction isn’t fitting considering they might then become backed with the consequences of terrorism, such as detention without charge. This might have the unfortunate side effect of stifling other valuable activist groups.,There’s a difference between political dissent and outright harassment, and PETA has swung too far to the extreme.

It’s the minor discrepancies that add up to set CHR in better stead than Team PNF.,PNF, composed of presidential candidate Mitch Piper, vice-president (operations) candidate Kasmet Niyongabo and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Davina Finn, is positioned to run the AMS reliably and uphold the status quo.,But Team CHR, composed of presidential candidate Safiah Chowdhury, vice-president (operations) candidate Ben Hartley and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Chris Rudnicki, is more prepared to hit the ground running with ambitious ideas and a focused approach.,CHR has been criticized for having lofty, unfeasible goals like bringing back Homecoming for 2011, reforming town-gown relations and working to implement solar panels at Queen’s.,The AMS could benefit from an executive team with passion and ambition behind their goals. CHR’s plans may not all end up being feasible, but they also won’t be harmful.,CHR has demonstrated sound and extensive research to back up many of their ambitious proposals. Their 40-page platform isn’t just bulk meant to sound impressive, and it doesn’t sacrifice quality or detail.,PNF’s platform lacks detail and its many careless spelling errors are a turn-off. Team PNF knows their platform backwards and forwards when speaking and have been impressive in running a good campaign. But the strength of PNF’s campaign doesn’t make up for its vague platform points.,PNF’s planned initiatives are perhaps more realistic than what CHR proposes. But in an AMS that has many weak spots, effective solutions will necessarily seem aggressive.,When it comes to anti-oppression and equity grants, PNF’s approach is concerning. The $5,000 grant PNF proposes for individuals with equity ideas is less focused than CHR’s proposal to give to established groups, and risks not addressing real equity issues on campus.,PNF presidential candidate Piper comes across as the strongest of the six. He’s an articulate speaker with evident leadership skills, but his team is behind the curve. Small delays in putting up PNF’s website and posting their platform add up to make Piper’s team appear less together than CHR.,Piper and CHR presidential candidate Chowdhury both have the potential to make a great president. Chowdhury demonstrated a strong leadership role last year at a challenging time for Queen’s University Muslim Students’ Association (QUMSA) and a similar drive shines through in this campaign.,Both vice-president (operations) candidates present as being very capable with a thorough knowledge of AMS services.,PNF’s candidate Niyongabo has a wealth of experience with finances outside of the AMS, positioning him well to handle operations.,CHR’s candidate Hartley’s experience serving on the Board of Directors also stands him in good stead. By occupying an internal position making decisions for the AMS, Hartley may have a slight upper hand. But this year, we can’t go wrong with either vice-president (operations) candidate.,The vice-president (university affairs) role is loosely defined. It’s important to select a candidate who will take the initiative to give the position some substance.,Rudnicki, CHR’s candidate for the role, has greater potential. As the Clubs Manager this year, Rudnicki has proven he can define a role for himself when given a position with unclear parameters.,Rudnicki has a tendency to let his passion get the better of him and speak before thinking—for instance, calling CHR’s proposed solar panel initiative “free money”—but this habit doesn’t occlude his potential.,PNF’s candidate for vice-president (university affairs), Finn has proven her leadership abilities through overseeing many powerful Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) organizations in her role as Society Affairs Commissioner. But she hasn’t made it clear what she would make of the vice-president (university affairs) role.,It’s unfortunate some supporters of PNF derailed the team’s campaign by resorting to petty politicking. Publicizing private e-mails and taking screenshots of Facebook activity is foolish and has undermined the representation of PNF’s quality ideas.,It’s also unfortunate the election has turned into a forum on solar panel initiatives when, in reality, whichever team is voted in will have little control over the project. There’s a role for student government in lobbying for initiatives like these, but solar panels are an issue that probably shouldn’t have made it into the campaign platforms at all.,Looking at the sum of all parts, CHR’s innovative approach, clear drive and well-stated goals combine to make them a better option for student government."},{"title":"Women’s studies worth it","url":"/story/2010-02-05/editorials/womens-studies-worth-it/","date":"February 5, 2010","content":"Women’s studies programs are on the outs at many Canadian universities—and for good reason, the National Post wrote in an editorial Jan. 26.,The Post’s editorial calls women’s studies programs “angry, divisive and dubious” and suggests many are changing their titles to appear less contentious.,Ascribing a radical feminist bent to many women’s studies courses, the Post condemns these classes for doing damage to families, court proceedings and simple everyday interactions between men and women.,The editorial is ironic in the sense that its ignorance demonstrates the very need for courses like women’s studies to continue to exist.,These courses play an important role in making both sexes aware of social issues.,In many cases, changing the nomenclature of women’s studies programs to “gender studies” is entirely appropriate and reflects a shift in the scope of the material covered, rather than an attempt to hide divisive subject matter.,Men are often turned off by course codes like “women’s studies,” which can be misleading when many such classes address issues pertaining equally to men and women.,The editorial also fails to consider the nuanced nature of women’s studies.

However, the final decision of whether or not the inquiry should be launched rests with the government’s executive branch.,Harper’s government views the request as a politically-motivated move on the part of the Opposition. But the government’s censoring of documents related to the detainee issue in Afghanistan is also driving further investigation.,While the request for an inquiry may be mainly motivated by political strategy, this doesn’t mean it should be ignored.,The Harper government should recognize that agreeing to an inquiry is a small cost to pay, compared to the jeopardy their political career may face if they oppose the will of Parliament.,Continuing to ignore warnings and resist inquiry requests only serves to make the issue more prominent, bringing it closer to the forefront of the public’s consciousness.,A government that has nothing to hide should have no qualms about being subjected to an inquiry.,Harper has asserted that opposition MPs are overstepping their bounds by questioning the integrity of Canadian troops. But this statement falls flat when considering the Opposition is more interested in investigating federal treatment of the issue, including the concealment of related documents. We shouldn’t let party politics obscure the importance of getting to the bottom of the truth. It’s disappointing questions of power are taking the front line and deflecting public attention from the significant issue of detainee treatment at hand.,Harper’s government would do well to conduct an inquiry, and to conduct themselves with transparency and accountability."},{"title":"Housing guide delivers","url":"/story/2010-01-19/editorials/housing-guide-delivers/","date":"January 19, 2010","content":"This month, the AMS Municipal Affairs Commission (MAC) posted a new online housing guide to aid Queen’s students with the house-hunting process.,One of executive Team CYZ’s six campaign promises, the guide outlines strategies on things like choosing housemates, viewing properties and signing leases.,MAC commissioner Libby Shaker said the AMS also plans to establish an online chat forum for students to share information about specific houses in the Ghetto.,The new online housing guide is a combination of various tips and factoids from existing resources rather than a reservoir of original material, but it is nonetheless a great tool for students looking to conduct a successful house hunt.,Faced with new decisions of great financial magnitude, first-years embarking on the house hunt will especially benefit from the MAC’s guidelines. The new housing guide’s easy accessibility and unified approach should ensure that most students who consult it are equipped to make informed decisions.,The MAC’s plans to add a discussion forum to the website by the end of the school year are promising. Dialogue among students is the most effective way to share the inside scoop on local accommodations.,The housing guide contains information on how to best choose your housemates, but it’s unlikely most students will take this advice. Discovering the types of people you are best suited to room with is more a question of living and learning than it is a fact that can be gleaned from a website.,The idea to develop a housing guide was one of Team CYZ’s best, but their promise will not be entirely fulfilled unless the site is properly promoted and maintained. The MAC should continue to update the housing guide so it remains relevant and should also advertise it widely.,One of the most important things to highlight for new house-hunters is the importance of being a good tenant and treating local properties with respect. Queen’s students should think of themselves as residents of Kingston rather than just visitors, and prioritize good relationships with neighbours and landlords. This is an area of tenant education the MAC would do well to target in the future.,First-time house-hunters shouldn’t let the January housing hype fill them with a false sense of urgency. With no discernable housing shortage in Kingston, house-hunters can approach the MAC’s new guide knowing there will be a place for everyone."},{"title":"Home, sweet home","url":"/story/2009-11-27/editorials/home-sweet-home/","date":"November 27, 2009","content":"As the temperature continues to drop and flu season begins to settle in, precautionary actions against the H1N1 virus become ever more prevalent in the minds of the general public.,But as November rolls slowly to an end, I’m becoming more and more weary of another kind of virus: homesickness, an affliction I am prone to catching around this time of year (and I doubt that I’m alone on this one).,While the pile of schoolwork keeps getting bigger with papers, exams, presentations and final projects, home becomes that much more appealing.,I find myself beginning to show early symptoms of the homesickness bug: class attendance is at a new low, procrastination is at an all-time high and my attention span is ...well, what attention span?,With the pressure of school at its peak and the holidays drawing nearer, all I can think about is how great it would be to be at home, equipped with a television (with cable!), a dishwasher and an always fully-stocked fridge.,I know there’s only a week of school left, but there’s so much work that I need to accomplish beforehand that home seems a lifetime away.,Homesickness may not seem comparable to the spread of the swine flu, but if you’ve ever been down this path before, then you know how much of a menace homesickness can be.,It starts with a feeling of nostalgia, probably provoked by the spirit of the holidays, then proceeds to a general lack of focus and concentration.,Memories of days spent at home before you started university only increase the awareness that you aren’t at home any longer, but away at school.,This is followed by a sudden consciousness of how much time has passed since those days spent at home, followed by the terrifying realization that you’re older than you thought and it’s probably time to start thinking seriously about what you’re going to do with your life.,Homesickness, at its worst, has the potential to develop into existential angst if you let it gain momentum.,So how does one build immunity to such a virus?,Unfortunately, homesickness can’t be averted by a bottle of Purell, but distraction is the best medicine.,Staying busy helps to keep my mind from wandering back home.

The position appears to have been created quickly, with little strategic planning, in order to appeal to the student electorate.,The ASUS Equity Commissioner’s role failed to have much effect, but this gestures less to the capability of the candidate selected than to the difficulty of the task at hand.,Overseeing equity issues for all of ASUS is a daunting task that, if given to one student, should at least have a clear mandate.

Further plans to install full-body scanners in major Canadian airports are in the works for the spring.,Current levels of airport security border on the theatrical, subjecting thousands of well-intentioned travelers to intensive searches.

Seeing a product labeled “low sodium” can be a turnoff for buyers shopping for flavour.,It’s unfortunate the taste for salt has become ingrained in Canadians’ eating habits. But in a culture where processed, packaged goods are essential to lives on the go, our desire for quick, convenient foods makes sodium a mainstay in the modern diet.,Adding salt is one of the least expensive ways to boost flavour in processed goods and, unless our lifestyles change, it’s unlikely our taste for salt will either.,The salt issue is a small facet of the larger problem of how North Americans consume food.

Last year, we decided we would choose a letter and a colour that had to apply to whatever gift we selected for each other. The letter was picked at random by my cousin as she closed her eyes and pressed a key on her keyboard. The colour was also picked at random, as I asked a friend of mine to give me the first colour they could think of.,We ended up with the letter K and the colour silver. This meant the name of our gifts had to start with the letter K and that the gift itself had to be silver. It was a challenge—I mean, K is kind of an obscure letter—but in the end it was fun.

It was absolutely beautiful and I loved it. I got her a stainless steel bottle of mousse for her hair from a name brand that started with the letter K. She had just gotten her hair cut short, so she was happy to try out a new product.,We both found the shopping to be much more fun than normal gift hunting. Plus, we went into it with no expectations.

You exercised extreme caution when using the word, and made absolutely certain that you had all your facts in place before using it.,Now, we throw it about so willy-nilly that it’s lost its weight. A friend of mine was called a racist last night because he supported a speech by Jason Kenney. I may not share all of our Immigration Minister’s views, but he has the right to his opinion as long as he doesn’t propagate hate, and people who go out to listen to them shouldn’t be blindly labelled as “racist.”,How dare we degrade such a heavy term to something we can throw around as an innocent taunt. It’s not a playground burn. It’s a word we need to refrain from using blindly before it completely loses its meaning.,It’s sad—I started writing this editorial with a smile on my face.

It’s also where Twitter’s use varies the most. While most blogs and news outlets with a Twitter account primarily provide links to their stories and articles, the Average Joe posts anything from links, pictures and music to jokes, sports commentary and what they’re having for lunch.,Somewhere in the middle lies the Twitter addict, the centre of the debate: posts dozens, maybe hundreds, of tweets a day. Re-tweets, posting popular links, following thousands of people. Creates a high signal-to-noise ratio.,How important is it that you see the newest LOLcat? Or a link to a news story that’s been re-tweeted thousands of times?,According to Nielsen Online, Twitter has a user retention rate of 40 per cent, meaning that around 60 per cent of the people who sign up don’t see the merit of these user patterns, either.,This isn’t to say there isn’t meaning to be found on Twitter. Some very smart people have accounts that enlighten thousands of people per day. They write satire, opinions and short prose worth reading. The problem is there’s no way to easily cut through all the nonsense to get to these valuable sites.,The common thread between these users is originality. The users who gain popularity on their own merit do so with original content, not the constant regurgitation of the Twitter zeitgeist.,Twitter has a “Suggested Users” list under the “Find People” link on their site. It consists mostly of people that are famous for something else, like politicians, actors, athletes and reporters. But the normal people making Twitter work for them as way to get their words out are nowhere to be found. New users have no sense of what’s really happening on the site.,Where Google is efficient at cutting through the internet as a whole to get what users want, Twitter makes it much more difficult to find what you’re looking for.,For example, the hashtag #Haiti returns hundreds of tweets a minute, making for hundreds of thousands a day since the recent earthquake. But there’s no guarantee you’d be able to drill down through the masses to find tweets about a certain aspect of the tragedy. My effort to find tweets from Haitians themselves was a lost cause.,Twitter is still in its infancy. Its vocabulary and etiquette are only beginning to be established.

I miss having my teachers know my name, being more than a number in a class of 400 and knowing where I belong within the school community.,I blame this sudden nostalgia on my high school visit, but I recognize it’s difficult not to express such emotions when you’re back in a familiar environment, talking to individuals who know you and who had a hand in creating your identity.,Catching up with my former teachers and schoolmates made me yearn for those high school days when I knew my role in the school environment. Getting to this comfortable point in Grade 12 wasn’t easy, but I often overlook this fact. If I think back to the beginning of Grade 9, I was in the same, overwhelming situation. Yet, I managed to build my niche by the end of high school.,I’m hoping for a similar outcome at Queen’s despite the great differences in population, responsibilities, and expectations between high school and university.,A comforting thought, however, is the many upper-years who have been successful in building their niches. If they can do it, why can’t I?,This is a question that I aim to answer in a few years. Until then, I’m still working on my niche."},{"title":"Opinions, anyone?","url":"/story/2010-01-15/editorials/opinions-anyone/","date":"January 15, 2010","content":"My involvement with the Journal over the past three years has taught me a lot.,For starters, no matter how hard you try to write the perfect article, there is always bound to be someone who’s got a problem with it.,Second, even though some students dismiss this paper as elitist hogwash, I see more people on campus reading it than any other Queen’s publication.,That might have to do with the fact that we come out twice a week, but—given that it’s the New Year—I’m taking an optimistic view on things.,Third, I’ve noticed the Journal discussion board is usually full of passionate dialogue and yes, sometimes I even hear that dialogue trickle around campus.,So what I’m wondering is—why, as the Opinions and Letters Editor, do I rarely receive letters or opinion pieces in my inbox?,Don’t get me wrong.

He then accessed the profile of an online “friend” to find its creator’s birthday, current city and maiden name.

The Internet is an open system designed to allow open access to information. There’s a wealth of knowledge available, but the responsibility rests with users to control and monitor what we share.,With social networking sites like Facebook, privacy settings are available for a reason. Users should take the time to educate themselves about these settings if they don’t want their personal information turning up in the wrong hands.,With few guidelines provided by social networking sites and e-mail host servers about which information to share over the Internet, Facebook’s growing popularity among young, unassuming users is concerning.,But posting personal information online isn’t necessarily dangerous, as long as users are careful about who can access it. Comparing Facebook use to displaying the contents of one’s wallet on the street is extreme, because closed-profile options are available to those who know how to use them.,Online identity theft presents a risk, but potential predators can also glean much of the same information working with what’s provided in the phone book. And although the information age has made access to personal data more instant and widespread, banks have also increased security measures.,The Internet’s power to share information is valuable and shouldn’t come under fire.

But when putting courses on the chopping block, university administrators should prioritize assessing a program’s value.,A course’s popularity is only one aspect of its importance. But the fact students actively protested the uncertain fate of Michalko’s contract suggests the course has value as well as popularity.,Michalko’s blindness should have little to do with discussion of the merits of the subject he teaches.,Whether or not his course in Disability Studies is seen as more legitimate because he has a disability himself, the program of study has its benefits.,With Michalko acting as the only undergraduate professor of Disability Studies, cutting his job would jeopardize students’ access to discussion of disability issues. The field is relevant to individuals with disabilities, but also relies on educating the public at large and creating allies in the community.,Acceptance and accessibility are issues of prime importance, especially at a university aiming to equip students as world citizens.,In a volatile economic environment, new fields with great potential to develop creative innovations are being victimized by academic programs with more stable histories.,The survival of relevant, contemporary programs depends on dialogue between students and administrators. As consumers in the educational marketplace, students should have their opinions considered.,One solution might be enrolling more students in Michalko’s 80-person classes,since the waiting lists are already teeming with names.,Discussions of not renewing Michalko’s contract hint at the University administration’s judgment on the relevance of his subject matter.

As a result, there’s a shift in the kinds of workers gaining admission to Canada.,Professional immigrants are being outnumbered by participants in the Foreign Worker Program, which brings low-skilled employees into the country on temporary permits.,Low-skilled foreign workers can be vulnerable once they immigrate, Fraser said, adding that the Department of Citizenship and Immigration has been hasty to make decisions without considering the costs, benefits and risks to the Canadian labour market.,Canada’s original immigration vision was to accept skilled, intelligent workers, giving the benefits of Canadian living to people who would work hard to improve our society. This vision seems to have gone awry, as skilled workers with qualifications from other countries still struggle to find employment in Canada.,The rise in the number of low-skilled workers being admitted to the country correlates with Canada’s shift to a service-based economy. In the service industry where many jobs require few advanced or professional skills, international workers with temporary permits can easily fill job openings. But with the economic downturn and the rise in oil prices, we can expect the service industry to see a rapid decline. It would be wise to re-evaluate Canada’s immigration strategy to keep up with these changes in the market.,Canada lets in the highest number of immigrants of any Western country, but has a disappointing track record of protecting them once they get here. Developed health, education and social services to support new immigrants should go hand-in-hand with an open-arms immigration policy.,Accepting fewer immigrants while working to improve the quality of life for new Canadians would be a proactive step.,It’s also concerning immigration decisions were made without a detailed cost-benefit analysis.,Canada’s decentralized federation, where Ottawa heads immigration but many services essential to new immigrants are provincially run, is problematic.

With 20 to 35 per cent of the Canadian population expected to come down with H1N1 if they remain unvaccinated, the influx of hospital cases could temporarily devastate our health-care system.,Guichon and Mitchell call on Canadians to engage in frank dialogue to ensure hospital beds remain available for those who need them most, such as diabetic children whose access to health care may be ousted by people who refuse the H1N1 vaccine and then come down with the illness. The firm suggestion that Canadians vaccinate themselves is valuable. If the federal government is going out of its way to invest in development and distribution of the vaccine, it’s for a good reason.,But it’s extreme to assert that other groups who rely on regular access to health care may be denied these rights in the interest of serving swine flu sufferers.,Employing scare tactics isn’t the most effective way to achieve public cooperation. The H1N1 vaccine should be treated like any other: some Canadians will refuse out of personal belief, and it’s intrusive to force the vaccine upon them.,It’s unfortunate many Canadians will refuse the vaccine as a result of being misinformed. Public health officials have struggled to control the message in a climate of media frenzy and online speculation. We can’t blame Canadians for being confused.,The normal flu shot’s unpredictability has also created a culture of doubt surrounding the H1N1 vaccine. Since the flu shot only targets what are predicted to be the most prevalent strands of the virus in any given year, it’s possible to be vaccinated against the normal flu and still fall ill by catching a rare strand. However, the H1N1 vaccine is more reliable in its specificity.,The H1N1 pandemic is worrisome, with an unusual pattern of infecting young people and a great ability to mutate.

The new courses will be available to Grade 11 and 12 students in Ontario, and will be offered as electives.,The Ministry’s initiative in launching a new group of relevant social science courses is laudable. It’s easy for high school students to be unfamiliar with topics like gender issues when these subjects aren’t part of the curriculum, and introducing courses that focus on social issues will raise younger students’ exposure to these topics.,Offering the new social science courses to high school students will also mean this group is more aware of course options in gender or cultural studies when they arrive at university.,One limitation of introducing the courses as optional electives is it’s unlikely their message will get to students who need to hear it most. Many students opting to take these courses are likely already aware of, or involved with, the related issues.,Students who would benefit most from instruction in gender, equity and cultural studies are those less aware of issues in the field—and those less likely to choose a course in this area.,Eventually, courses like the ones the Ministry plans to introduce next fall should be mandatory in the high school curriculum.,The perception that programs like gender studies are not “real” academic subjects is still surprisingly prevalent, and signals the urgency of the need for related high school courses.,Another concern is finding qualified teachers to instruct the new courses, as the interdisciplinary material lies outside the bounds of most conventional “teachables.” Gender studies is not currently considered a “teachable” subject for students in the Concurrent Education program at Queen’s, but it is no less valuable than learning subjects like French or chemistry.,The Ministry’s move is an important acknowledgment of the growing field of equity studies, and is likely to produce more informed high school graduates sensitive to current social issues.,High school students should recognize that gender and cultural studies are about more than feminism, and they should avoid the temptation to consider the new electives bird courses. The innovative, interdisciplinary course offerings have a lot to teach if Ontario’s students are willing to learn."},{"title":"Boys’ school misses the mark","url":"/story/2009-10-27/editorials/boys-school-misses-mark/","date":"October 27, 2009","content":"Boys who underachieve in the classroom may soon have a school of their own, the Globe and Mail reported Oct. 20.,The Toronto District School Board’s new education director, Chris Spence, has proposed the first-ever all-male public elementary school in Ontario. The school, called the Male Leadership Academy, would provide a more hands-on approach than traditional classrooms to target the specific educational needs of young boys.,Last year in Toronto public schools, boys were 3.5 times more likely than girls to be suspended. Boys also consistently perform at lower levels than their female classmates, regardless of socioeconomic factors. Spence cites boys’ disengagement at school as an indicator of “poor grades and unproductive lives” later on.,It’s a positive step to look at children’s engagement at school and consider ways of improving performance. Recognizing that mainstream curriculum and teaching styles don’t work for all groups is important in the process of meeting educational demands.,But it’s possible to address learning challenges without developing an entirely all-male facility.,Spence’s plan makes the assumption all boys prefer hands-on learning while girls are docile. In reality, the gender divide isn’t so clear-cut.,It’s a nice idea to give choice to those who use the public school system, which inherently doesn’t offer many options. But a separate all-male environment isn’t how our larger society works.,Living in a co-ed world is inevitable, and we may as well learn to compromise early on.,Proposing the Male Leadership Academy as a “school of choice” for families interested in the single-sex approach to education is a good approach, as families won’t be forced to send their sons to the school simply because they live in the district. But it’s unclear how the school would meet demands if many boys were interested in attending the Male Leadership Academy.,Segregating the sexes has worked in the private and Catholic school systems, but this antiquated tradition shouldn’t be used to bolster Spence’s ideas about the marvels of single-sex learning.,Private schools are an attractive choice more because of their access to funding and facilities than their tendency to divide the sexes.,Spence calls on parents to get involved in their children’s education.

For instance, terminally ill patients are often prescribed painkillers like morphine to reduce suffering, but taking painkillers in such high doses can be fatal.,The College’s endorsement of euthanasia can be interpreted as a move that conflicts with the Criminal Code. The group is calling for new legislation that will reflect the importance of euthanasia and the reality that it exists already. It’s surprising the Quebec College of Physicians is showing formal support for such a legal and moral grey area of medicine. But the group’s recognition of euthanasia’s value as an end-of-the-line option in patient care is praiseworthy.,With a high proportion of Quebec doctors saying they already witness forms of euthanasia in practise, it seems illogical to have to skirt around the law to perform a course of action perceived as commonplace.,Euthanasia shouldn’t be sanctioned simply because we know it’s happening. But it prevails because it offers an escape route for terminally ill people who have exhausted all other treatment options and wish to die with dignity.,Euthanasia does invite concerns of abuse and should be closely regulated.

But Charles Pascal, the government’s early learning adviser, said children enrolled in full-day schooling before Grade 1 are better off academically and socially than their classmates.,McGuinty cites investment in the younger generation, Canada’s future workforce, as the main reason for the kindergarten change.,Despite the looming deficit, investing in kindergarten programs is worth the high price tag. It’s easy to dismiss early childhood education with claims we won’t see the results for 20 years, but the long-term benefits of developing critical learning skills will eventually make a more productive workforce.,It’s surprising kindergarten isn’t obligatory, since it’s widely documented that the first five years are the most formative in a child’s development. There’s a critical window of development during which children can best master literacy and math skills. Expanding kindergarten to a full-day program would target these abilities at the optimal time.,As Pascal points out, enriched early learning will assist children’s academic development as well as their social skills.,Immersion in an educational environment for a full day will expose Ontario’s children to literacy, social interaction and physical education, rather than the sedentary T.V. time they would likely get at home.,McGuinty’s plan will also lift the burden on parents who have to find and finance childcare in order to work. In an economy where working parents likely have to put in extra hours, full-day kindergarten will be less disruptive to work schedules.,Filling the day’s extra hours with kindergarten, rather than basic childcare, provides a more enriching environment. While childcare might be a lower-cost alternative, teachers can offer a more targeted curriculum than Early Childhood Educators.,A simple cost-benefit analysis might suggest full-day kindergarten is too pricey to be worthwhile right now.

In a nation that functions with virtual independence, it’s easy to forget the figurehead.,As a more visible presence on the home front than the Queen, Governor General Michäelle Jean is a relevant figure to open the Olympics.,But moving away from Canada’s image as a smaller power controlled by a British monarchy doesn’t call for nostalgia. Rather, the monarchy’s changing relevance is a positive step in Canada’s self-identification as a vibrant national entity.

Until then, driver using hand-held phones will merely be given a warning.,With driver distraction at an all-time high thanks to fancy features on new mobile phones, Ontario’s initiative to crack down on behind-the-wheel phone use comes at a good time.,The new law will help reduce the temptation to talk and text in traffic—something drivers easily succumb to while knowing it’s unsafe. Typing into a phone while driving is a foolish move that puts the driver’s safety at risk and jeopardizes the safety of others on the road. The availability of technologies like Bluetooth makes it possible for the province to enact the phone ban without denying drivers the right to make calls or send messages from their vehicle.,But Bluetooth might not be much safer than hand-held phones, considering it still provides the distraction of conversation. It’s important to look into the relative risks associated with this technology.,It’s unfortunate police won’t be enforcing fines until February.

Bike rentals require a credit card deposit and a fee of one Euro per day or 29 Euros for an annual pass.,But 80 per cent of the original fleet of 20,600 bikes have either disappeared or been damaged since the program’s inception two years ago. The bikes, which cost $3,500 each, have appeared broken in ditches, tossed into the Seine or on their way to black markets in northern Africa.,The idea of communal rental bikes is a great initiative and a unique way to take action as a city against climate change. But without provisions for vandalism, the plan made idealistic assumptions about the city that created it.,With novel projects like this one, it’s difficult to find a reference point from which to calculate possible losses. But the severe damage to Paris’s bikes indicates the plan should consider taking a new direction.,With many of the bikes stolen and found in low-income neighbourhoods, it’s possible social issues are at the heart of the problem. If marginalized populations are vandalizing bikes as a form of rebellion, their resentment should be addressed as an issue of its own.,Rather than investing large sums of money in bikes the population clearly isn’t respecting, the City of Paris should consider improving infrastructure for cyclists. By using money that would be spent on the rental project to add a network of bike trails and turn some streets into cyclist-only zones, the culture of biking in Paris would be safer and more accessible to the general public.,By strengthening infrastructure and making biking a more attractive transit option, the City would move towards achieving carbon-cutting transportation methods without incurring the costs of vandalism.,Parisians could buy an inexpensive bike to use in the city with the money they save by not participating in the rental program.,With a strong public transit system and a large following of cyclists, Paris is well-placed to be a leader in green city transit.

That family of bears taught me important life lessons ranging from the dangers of becoming the jealous “green-eyed monster” to why I should clean my room.,Finally, I’m sure everyone remembers Arthur.

The Hannah Montanas and Dora the Explorers of today simply don’t match up to our favourites from the ’90s.

So naturally, I’m working on none of the above.,The procrastination bug has struck again, and admittedly it’s something I’m not totally unfamiliar with.,I was first labelled a procrastinator at age eight, when my grade four teacher assigned the class a science project that involved collecting and identifying rocks. Knowing early on that science wasn’t for me, I ignored the project for weeks in favour of book reports and art assignments. When the time came to hand in my rock collection, I had nothing to show for it and despite endless (albeit warranted) nagging from my teacher, I never did finish it.,Back then, as a carefree youngster, I felt very little guilt over my procrastination and had no qualms about watching TV or riding my scooter around the block when I should have been studying.,By the time I got to high school, my attitude changed. I wanted to learn and do well academically, but that didn’t mean I left my procrastinating ways behind. It simply meant I was procrastinating with a lot more skill and guilt.,Over the years, I honed my procrastination skills into a quasi-art form. Selected methods included: laboriously cleaning my room (who can study in a disorganized space?), taking a ‘short’ nap (to allow for optimum concentration) and catching up on my (non school-related) reading, which is more productive than watching TV, I reasoned.,I came to be known as the master of procrastination among my friends—a title I didn’t entirely reject. By Grade 12, I could proudly (and honestly) boast that I had never studied for more than about three tests or exams in my entire life. My friends would watch in awe as I left my English paper or history presentation until the night before and still got a 95 per cent.,The truth is, I hated leaving things until the last minute, and I still do. As much as I can’t stand being reminded by my parents or friends how well I could have done on that test or midterm if I had actually studied, I know they’re right.,By my first year at Queen’s, I had begun to seek out ways to curb my problem, but to no avail. Endless self-help books later, I’m still selling myself short through my chronic procrastination.,I know procrastination is a coping mechanism for anxiety; I know it’s a sign of perfectionism and indecisiveness. The problem is figuring out how to stop. Telling me why I procrastinate doesn’t help me fix the problem; it just gives me something else to think about and distract myself with.,By the time this goes to print, I’ll most likely be frantically trying to figure out why Peter the Great was so great and doing a last-minute analysis on the relationships between women in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. If you see me in Stauffer, don’t hesitate to stop for a chat. I’ll probably be looking for a distraction."},{"title":"More than a word","url":"/story/2009-10-23/editorials/more-word/","date":"October 23, 2009","content":"The list of unusable words is long, but getting claustrophobic about my vocabulary won’t help anyone.,Derogatory terms are facing the social firing squad, although there’s one that has yet to drop as hard as the others.,The word retard is still widely used, often without receiving the mass cringing the others are met with.,Correcting it shouldn’t take a social firing squad. It shouldn’t take a poster, or friends cringing. That makes it a political correctness issue when it should be a human issue.,I don’t want this editorial to be a sermon. If there’s an issue, it shouldn’t be remedied by inciting guilt or shame.

It’s a unifying quality. After it ceased to be a medical term, the word retard defined people by their intellectual limitations, not their humanity.,Disambiguation doesn’t alleviate the word’s offensiveness. Its essential meaning isn’t offensive. Retarded literally means to slow down.,But the common usage isn’t an adjective. It’s a noun that identifies people by the association with a developmental disability, and not by their individual names.,Mental retardation was a medical term—that’s the origin of the inference.,The term no longer has a technical meaning, just a derogatory stigma that remains attached. That attachment sends shockwaves beyond a single one-word insult to demean people we’ve never met.,It’s the unknown individual’s dignity that’s threatened. Those affected don’t need to be around to hear the word used, because the repercussions extend far beyond earshot.,The casual use of the term is normalizing it.,Saying “You’re a retard for doing that” contradicts the objectives of so many organizations that aim to create communities where everyone is included and valued.,I have a need to feel valued. I think it’s a basic human need.,If my name were used to taunt anyone for doing something stupid, it would erode my own feelings of value. I can’t fully create the feeling internally, but I’ve seen it felt on other faces.,The word retard is a label. It defines people by using an objectionable term for their disability. Defining someone by their challenge limits them to that challenge.,We can’t change how we’re born, but there’s potential to become more than what we’re born.,Limiting words that hinder this potential is better than limiting people by using words."},{"title":"Punch drunk love","url":"/story/2009-10-30/editorials/punch-drunk-love/","date":"October 30, 2009","content":"Amongst my friends and housemates, there’s a drunken compulsion that I’m famous for indulging.,No, not that.,You’re disgusting.,After one too many drinks, a favourite and highly-mocked pastime of mine is to explain to my friends, loudly and at great length, how wonderful they are and just how much they mean to me.,While most of these outbursts border on (or set up permanent residence in) the ridiculous—“When we’re old we’re still going to be friends and we’ll wear the most comfortable shoes ever made!”—I actually think the sentiment’s quite nice.,Working at the Journal, I’ve been the recipient of a fair share of negative remarks—thanks, Internet commenters and select members of the Queen’s drama department—and they can get difficult to ignore.,People seem to jump at the chance to express their displeasure and impatience, expounding the stupidity of a TA who gave them a bad grade and commenting with unmatched vitriol on the wait time at the Common Ground, but when a moment for every-day congeniality or congratulation occurs, there are fewer speakers to be found.,That’s not to say there isn’t a lot of love out there—because there is—I just think it gets greatly overshadowed by the human desire to complain about things.,I’m not immune. I’ve always been somewhat of a pessimist, and lately I’ve been making a concerted effort to move my brain towards the positive, which is probably where this “let’s all hug” ethos is coming from.,If someone you know has done something you admire or if a friend of yours is managing a high-stress workload with aplomb, why not tell them so?,Complaining about issues like the ones above serves no real purpose; you’re left still mad, and the people you’re whining about aren’t going to be pleased either.

If you’re a positive person, I don’t think you’re more likely to attract positive events to your life. But your experience of these events—which is really all you can control anyway—will be easier to handle.,I think it’s important to remember during the stresses of November—the month of midterms, colds and flus and dreary weather—that a crazy schedule or a breakup isn’t the end of the world, or even particularly important in the grand scheme of things, especially when you have friends you can wear orthopaedic shoes with in the future.,It’s hokey, maybe, but I don’t think it’s too much to promote a “beer goggles of the heart” philosophy.

Even worse, a display of tacky, plastic light-up things might begin to sing as you walk by.,Oddly enough, I often wonder how I would describe the holiday season to an alien. I’d probably mention something about Santa and the North Pole, sugarplums, reindeer, flocking to various places of worship and how, when it snows, people think the holiday season is infinitely better.,I’d advise the alien to watch It’s A Wonderful Life and stay away from eggnog. I guess I would also have to mention something about the importance of family and how we assemble together to binge. And something about childhood innocence and how the driving force behind the holiday seems to revolve around children—and our collective memories of youth.,But to fully explain the holiday season, I would have to answer another question about the December ritual that becomes harder to understand as I get older. How do I explain why holiday traditions and memories translate into massive robotic consumption? What does all of this buying, wrapping and credit card-swiping have to do with anything? When did we become programmed to buy? Who actually likes gingerbread?,I’m not trying to get all TV-movie special on you. It’s not that I think our immodest consumption is in some way distasteful in lieu of all those grand hymns—it just seems unnecessary. Last holiday season I was in a shopping mall and realized I desired nothing in any of the stores. I felt sick because of the lights and desperately needed air. Someone once told me that not wanting anything is a sign of depression. Thankfully my desires aren’t limited to the boxy stores in a shopping complex.,This holiday season my family and I have decided not to exchange gifts. This could all go terribly wrong because we’ll have to actually talk to one another, instead of frantically opening presents while on sugar highs only to crash into turkey comas a couple of hours later. We’ll need to come up with some ingenious way of passing the time.,Personally, I’d like to start a new tradition where, instead of A Christmas Carol, we watch George A. Romero’s Dawn of the Dead. If I were to explain this to an alien, I would say it reminds me although the zombies in the mall might engage in their relentless pursuit of brainless, monster consumption, there’s a metaphorical helicopter with enough fuel left in it to carry my family and I away from the horror.,I’m only half-kidding.

If waves of Facebook events ranging from pre-game drinking parties to T-shirt sales are any indication, this weekend is going to be wild.,I should stop here before I make you think this editorial is about football.,It’s about figure skating.,I’m pretty sure I just lost most of my readers, but for those of you still reading, this isn’t an open fan letter about how much I love figure skating, either. The hoopla over football this weekend reminds me of one downside to being a fan of this (otherwise amazing) sport.,Being a figure skating fan is kind of lonely.,It’s not the type of sport where you walk into offices the next morning to hear people chattering away about last night’s competition. It rarely makes it onto the news or gets broadcasted live, and there isn’t much off-season excitement.,As for watching a competition, it doesn’t involve dressing up in team gear or consuming copious amounts of alcohol, and I’m lucky if it involves a friend.,When someone finds out I’m a figure skating enthusiast, I’m met with one of the following reactions.,First, there are the ones who say, “Oh, I like figure skating too.” Fantastic, right? No. While you may think my first reaction is to say, “Wow, we could be friends!” past encounters tell me to approach with caution. Too many times I’ve been disappointed by their follow-ups: “I watch it once every four years during the Olympics,” or “Yeah, the stunts are totally wicked.”,The second group of people includes those who assume my current obsession is a hangover from my past. They are the ones who ask, “Were you a figure skater?” They find my obsession a little odd, but it’s an oddity that can be forgiven with the presence of some personal connection with the sport. In case you fall into this group and are now curious—no, I wasn’t a figure skater.,Lastly, there are people who go straight for the laugh. Over the years as a figure skating fan I’ve heard everything from, “Yoon, that’s not even a sport,” to “You and my grandmother would get along really well.”,But even with the drawbacks, I’ve been a fan for the last six years. I find ways to coax my friends to go with me when an event comes near the city, and I satisfy my need to follow mainstream organized sports with basketball.,The Yates Cup is this Saturday, and that’s probably where most of you will be. It’s not that I don’t have any school spirit, but I won’t be joining the crowd.

If the fee increase is approved, individual adult fares will rise from $2.75 to $3.00.,The TTC is also putting forth a motion to extend discounted rates for high school students to include university and college students.,In anticipation of customers wanting to stockpile tokens purchased before the new fare comes into effect, the TTC has implemented a rationing strategy. Per visit, customers are limited to purchases of five tokens each at booths, and one token each at mechanical dispensers. The TTC relies on the circulation of about 400,000 tokens each day to avoid running out, and rationing has resulted in long ticket-purchasing lines at rush hour. The TTC’s choice to extend student rates to those in post-secondary studies is a logical and long overdue step. Because the majority of college and university students are young adults trying to support themselves with little cash, it makes even more sense to offer this demographic discounts than to cut the tab for high school students.,Stockpiling tokens is counterproductive in a system that relies on their broad circulation to function. But the hoarding problem also highlights the token system’s archaic nature. The TTC should consider the more modern and convenient payment options seen in other major metropolises, like Paris.,It’s easy to dismiss the TTC as a service with few visible improvements to show for its rising costs. But commuters should look to the federal and provincial governments who spearhead extension projects as the source of the need for increasing fares.,Working to develop the TTC’s infrastructure should be an important priority. By extending service to new areas, more of Toronto’s suburban population can take advantage of public transit.,The TTC is actively undertaking new initiatives in infrastructure that depend on fare hikes like the one proposed for Jan. 2010. It’s the lag time between these developments being financed and being useable that creates conflict for commuters looking to get the improvements they pay for.,Without a ticket price increase, the TTC’s quality would suffer.

The President accepted the announcement nobly, as it would have been a controversial move to decline the award.,But given Obama’s short term in office so far, it’s premature to award a Nobel Prize to a man who hasn’t yet achieved tangible results for peace, though they may be on the horizon.,Obama has made pledges with great potential, such as commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But having a vision isn’t so difficult as executing its success.,When it comes to the Nobel Peace Prize, results should be rewarded, and no less. Obama is more popular than former President George W.

Elections are the arena for this recognition, and Obama has already won.,It would have been equally effective for the Nobel committee to issue a statement in praise of Obama’s efforts while recognizing a lesser-known peace worker with the prize. For an award designed to bring the efforts of valuable peacemakers into the limelight, it’s counterintuitive to give the prize to someone as present in the public eye as Obama.,For a president elected to make strides toward peace, bestowing additional honours for working towards this expectation seems redundant.,It’s unfortunate Obama will now face the challenge of having all he does in his presidency held up to the standard of what’s Nobel-worthy.

Our society’s obsession with thinness is too deeply ingrained to solve with a mere disclaimer.,Like warning labels on cigarette packages that have little effect on those already addicted, photo disclaimers aren’t likely to affect the choices of women who struggle with eating disorders.,The business of fashion photography relies on selling images people want to see. When consumer psychology demands a slim, streamlined ideal of beauty, the media will deliver. Without a larger social and educational movement to shift our perceptions of beauty, regulation labels won’t have much impact.,Introducing disclaimers lets the fashion industry keep going down the same path while feeling better about it because they’ve slapped on a warning label.,For models who already question their body image, having every digital alteration listed in the corner of a magazine ad is an embarrassing way to draw attention to perceived flaws.,In a world where retouching magazine models is standard practice, the fashion industry would find a way to do their work even with a disclaimer.,Banning digital alteration is an impossible ideal that would stunt fashion photographers’ art.

The women pioneering the case want to strike down laws that prohibit living off the avails of prostitution and establishing brothels.,Federal prosecutor Michael Morris said decriminalization could result in more women looking to prostitution as a career choice, while Laura Holland of the Aboriginal Women’s Action Network said she views prostitution as violence against women.,It’s impressive these three women have come so far in proposing such legislation. The long history of prostitution indicates the problem won’t disappear on its own unless action is taken.,Many choices in our society are illegal, yet commonly made. It’s naive to assume prostitution will vanish from streets if the act is considered criminal. It’s easy to say prostitutes should try harder to secure education or other employment, but that assumes a rosy view of these people’s situations. Often, prostitution is a last resort for those who have nothing to give but their bodies. The assertion that decriminalization could establish prostitution as a viable career choice is dubious.,Decriminalizing prostitution would minimize the harm that comes from dealing in a trade that happens away from the law’s protective eye. Prostitutes should have the safety net to call police if they run into trouble, rather than running from authorities.,Legislation would help those in the sex trade move towards basic rights to health and safety expected in any workplace. Enacting legislation doesn’t imply any moral stance on prostitution—choosing the term “decriminalization” over “legalization” has an important neutral connotation.,The assertion that prostitution is, in itself, an act of violence against women neglects to consider male prostitution.

German, Italian and Spanish would be able to merge similar courses with only a few students into one single course within the department.,The merge would be an innovative way to keep small departments afloat while coping with budget cuts of 15 per cent over three years. In an economic climate where cost cutting is a reality, merging the modern languages departments will let the University keep a broad curriculum.,The choice to cut administrative costs is the best option when the alternative is to sacrifice either staff members or whole departments.,Facing the possibility of nonexistence as departments, merging German, Italian and Spanish is the better choice.,Combining smaller courses into one is a potential drawback because it’s unclear how this would work on a practical level in the classroom. It would be effective to consult students potentially interested in taking these courses.,However, the new department may encourage students who are interested in acquiring a basic, working knowledge of several modern languages rather than an intense focus on one.

Zachary, who brought the knife to school out of excitement for joining the Cub Scouts, now faces 45 days in a district reform school while his family appeals his punishment.,Strict school violence policies have been cropping up in response to tragedies like the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings. Zero-tolerance anti-weapon rules that leave little room for teachers’ individual discretion are favoured because they avoid the possibility of bias or discrimination.,Reducing violence in schools is a valuable objective and zero-tolerance policies can be effective. However, it’s important to establish a reasonable definition of the term “weapon.” In a classroom, lunchboxes or pencils could be just as harmful as a camping utensil given the possessor’s intent to harm.,It’s unlikely this six-year-old had malicious intentions. It would’ve been more appropriate to confiscate the utensil for the day and give Zachary a warning.,Blanket policies run into trouble when they fail to leave room for nuance, such as a child’s age or the size of their “weapon.” Airplanes have established reasonable guidelines to control what’s appropriate on board, and schools should follow suit.,It’s disappointing teachers have no discretion in enforcing anti-violence policies in schools with the zero-tolerance approach. Although it’s important to avoid discrimination in evaluating infractions, schools should put faith in the teachers they hire to be unbiased.,Developing a written code of conduct relating to weapons in the classroom would allow for more discretion than zero-tolerance while setting out clear parameters.

His events, mainly held by private-sector organizations, receive security funding from the RCMP to control crowds of protesters who may pose a threat to Bush or his audiences.,Bush’s security tab far exceeds that of any other President-turned-public speaker. At a speaking event in Toronto in May, former president Bill Clinton’s security costs came to $12,000. Bush’s bill at the same location was closer to $108,000.,Having Bush as a visiting spokesman holds value for Canadians. Although Clinton’s lower security price tag makes him a desirable choice, having a diversity of dignified speakers in Canada is good intellectual exercise—even if we don’t side with their views.,It’s vital to provide any visiting dignitary with protection. Being a country where a public figure encounters harassment or injury would be regrettable and embarrassing.,Security measures are in place for the benefit of the VIP, but it’s also important to keep dissenting groups under control for greater public safety among those who attend the speaking events.

Companies shouldn’t take advantage of taxpayers’ dollars by expecting the public to chip in for the security costs of private events.,It’s logical for private firms to incur the majority of costs, because it’s these groups who will attend and benefit from the lectures. Charging higher prices for tickets would generate revenue to put toward security.,The RCMP should develop a standard level of security protection for visiting dignitaries with an associated baseline cost. If a particular guest requires more security, extra costs should be covered by the guest or by the private organization that invited the guest.,Levels of security coverage should never be determined by the general public’s opinion of a visitor.

But Vancouver’s willingness to move ahead with eco-friendly installations is a step towards environmental awareness that will have a positive impact on the air we all breathe.,The success of all-electric cars will depend on the number of people who are both willing to convert and able to afford them. Currently, only a small number of people use electric vehicles and would benefit from the chargers.,Given the high cost of electric vehicles, it’s unlikely the majority of Vancouver’s population would be able to afford one—meaning few would benefit from a network of chargers. Getting electric cars on the streets will give Vancouverites visible progress toward their goal of out-greening other cities. But it’s important to move beyond the surface hype of electric vehicles and consider the underlying factors that might not make them so green, after all.,The city should proceed carefully while considering the cost of developing charging stations, as the money comes from taxpayers’ pockets.,With the rise in dense urban living spaces, public transit and biking are often better options than choosing to drive. The City of Vancouver should focus on promoting these methods of transportation rather than encouraging a higher volume of cars on the roads.,While paving the way for electric cars is an exciting initiative that shows environmental consciousness, more dialogue is needed so Nissan’s deal doesn’t become a vehicle for taxpayer frustration."},{"title":"Think reduction, not rank","url":"/story/2009-10-23/editorials/think-reduction-not-rank/","date":"October 23, 2009","content":"The Copenhagen summit starting Dec. 7, 2009 is a chance to negotiate a new international treaty addressing climate change, columnist Simon Jackson for CBC News reported Oct. 19.,According to Jackson, the Copenhagen treaty is poised to effect more change than did the Kyoto Protocol given the rise in public support for environmental issues in the “new, post-Inconvenient Truth world.”,Jackson counters the perception that Canada is the least climate-friendly G8 country and dismisses suggestions that our country lacks a climate change action plan—or any interest in creating one.,Prime Minister Stephen Harper has left skepticism behind and changed his tune on climate change issues, Jackson argues, adding that despite more immediate concerns like the economic recession, focusing on climate change will likely give the Tories an electoral advantage.,It’s ambitious to think pithy emissions reduction slogans like Harper’s “50 per cent by 2050” will work.,The climate change we’re witnessing is a result of emissions released since the Industrial Revolution, and it’s unlikely we’ll see any major results of emissions-curbing behaviours during our lifetime.,But just because we won’t be around to reap the rewards doesn’t mean we shouldn’t put in the work now for a healthier planet.,It’s refreshing that environmental activism isn’t a concern exclusive to Left-Wing groups anymore—it has become everyone’s issue.,For politicians whose electoral success hinges on relatively short-term solutions, planning several generations into the future for climate change presents a new kind of challenge.,It’s unclear if Harper is coming around on climate change for the right reasons, but it’s still a positive shift.,Copenhagen’s value lies in bringing representatives from industrial and developing nations together.,It’s important to emphasize the environment’s importance to developing nations who see emissions-heavy industrialization as necessary.

Anti-smoking groups in Ontario are calling for any recovered money to be channelled into public health initiatives, rather than general government spending.,British Columbia and New Brunswick have launched similar lawsuits to reclaim funds spent on tobacco-related care.,Ontario is justified in holding tobacco companies responsible for health care costs. In a society where smoking and its heavily advertised image have worked their way into pop culture, the onus to pay for the consequences should rest with the industry that started the trouble. Unlike other industries considered harmful to health like producers of junk food and alcohol, cigarette companies have the advantage of addiction. The tobacco industry preys on consumers who establish a habit they can’t break. And unlike the McDonald’s or Merlot that can be enjoyed in moderation, smoking is directly related to lung cancer.,This $50 billion is better in the hands of the government than in the clutches of cigarette manufacturers.,Anti-smoking advocacy groups are proactive in suggesting any funds recovered from this lawsuit should go to public health projects. Spending money on education campaigns and cracking down on convenience store clerks who sell to minors are both good steps toward removing cigarettes from our culture.,Increasing the cost of tobacco products would also be a powerful step to reduce future health problems. Prohibitive costs from high taxation would lower demand for cigarettes.,Making cigarettes less accessible is the best way to curb destructive habits. Moving to illegalize tobacco products would only increase the underground market for contraband cigarettes, resulting in fewer regulations and easier access for teenagers.,Young people are vulnerable to their parents’ choices about cigarettes and glamorous ad campaigns target teens, the generation most likely to become addicted.

Drunk driving fatalities dropped 23 and 36 per cent in Ireland and Australia, respectively, after legislation came into effect.,Civil libertarians and others argue the proposed law would violate the right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure.,Based on the success of Ontario’s RIDE programs, the proposed legislation allowing for random breathalysers would be an intelligent step towards curbing a devastating problem. Pulling even one drunk driver off the roads would make the new law worthwhile, because this represents saving lives.,The minor embarrassment or delay associated with being pulled over for a spot check shouldn’t pose problems for sober Canadian drivers who have nothing to hide. The small inconvenience of being subjected to a random breathalyser test is far less important than preventing the fatalities that occur as a result of drunk drivers’ foolish choices.,Although slightly more intrusive than RIDE programs, random breathalyser tests are likely to be more effective at catching drunk drivers on the roads as well as deterring those who shouldn’t be driving from getting behind the wheel.,Positive results in other countries are encouraging, too. Thirty-six per cent is a meaningful figure when we consider how many saved lives it represents.,Driving is a privilege, and a dangerous one. In inebriated hands, cars can easily turn into weapons and it’s only right to reduce the harm they may cause.,It’s unfortunate an intrusive law is required to help people make the choice not to drink and drive.

Craig Kielburger founded Free the Children—the world’s largest network of children fighting against child labour—at age 12. What am I compared to them?,Well for one, I’m a Queen’s student. I attend one of Canada’s top universities, so that might give me a leg up in the world. I know many intelligent Queen’s students and I think they’re going to accomplish great things.

With the sun shining and campus packed by day—and the gargantuan list of possible outings during a seemingly never-ending Frosh Week by night—it’s easy to forget what’s approaching: midterm season.,Suddenly, September living gives way to a visible shift in the emotions running through campus.

Residence administration should have faith students will learn the courtesies of cohabitation as part of this natural learning curve. Conflict resolution is a skill students should be able to develop in real time, without resorting to a patronizing clause in a guidebook.,Even for those without a roommate, residence provides practice living in close quarters and an exercise in co-operation. It’s not easy sharing living space, but that’s no excuse for students not to employ common sense and discuss parameters with their roommates.,It’s unclear how Tufts plans to enforce the new policy. The Residential Life Office likely has more pressing issues to focus on than patrolling roommates’ sex lives. A concern that’s affected only a handful of students in recent years seems unworthy of serious intervention. It’s also difficult to define what the rule considers “sexual activity” to be, leaving grey areas in the policy.,Pierre Trudeau’s famous assertion that the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation is also relevant to school authorities and residence halls.

The rain undoubtedly played a role in keeping people away from Aberdeen, but the weather’s probably getting too much credit. I’d like to think students understood the potentially destructive party wasn’t worth their time.,The event was more notable for its strong police presence than anything else. Police clearly came in with a mandate to keep crowds moving. Our reporters saw arrests for drinking on the grass, tickets for swearing and countless other acts of borderline brutality that became the norm for the night. One of our staff got shoved by police and told to “beat it.”,I don’t buy the argument that because the street party involved mostly non-Queen’s students, we shouldn’t shoulder the blame. Queen’s students started the Aberdeen street “tradition” and it’s always been our responsibility to end it. Students made a statement this year by staying away in droves compared to years past. While the street party may not be dead, it certainly took a hit this year.,There’s something to be said for the work-hard, play-hard attitude that comes with being a Queen’s student. Having a reputation as both an academic powerhouse and a party school is unique and a source of pride for me. The street party is the ugly side of that equation. I’m proud to be a Queen’s student, but it’s hard when my neighbourhood looks more like a G8 summit than a place of higher learning.,The University’s strategy of cancelling Homecoming and turning a blind eye to Aberdeen could have been disastrous. They likely would have had to answer to any serious injuries to their students.

Whether he made the right decision or not, it was a difficult and unpopular one. But so far, it seems to be paying off.,If and when Homecoming returns, it’s inevitable partying will follow—Queen’s legendary spirit will make sure of that. When Principal Woolf reviews the Homecoming decision late next year, he would do well to consider the origins of the street party and provide a viable alternative for students and alumni so we don’t end up where we were in 2005.,Fauxcoming probably isn’t a thing of the past.

But thoughts of moving don’t come without the knowledge that there are things I’ll miss when it comes time to leave them behind.,With dreams of living somewhere past the Walkhome boundaries comes the realization that my housemates most likely won’t be coming with me.,Remember the point in your childhood when you were first introduced to the idea of roommates? For me, it was summer camp: sharing a cabin with four other girls who I could make beaded bracelets and sing Kum Bay Ya with all through the night seemed just too good to be true.,Later, TV shows like Friends glamourized apartment existence. Rooming with friends was living the dream, complete with romance, pet ducks, trivia competitions and days spent lounging at the downstairs coffee shop.,Needless to say, I couldn’t wait to have housemates of my own.,But these days, as school gets busier and commitments pile up, my two housemates and I can barely find a time in the day when we’re all home and not rushing off to somewhere else. Passing each other bleary-eyed on our way from late shifts to early classes, it’s easy to let the obligations scrawled on our wall calendar take over and surrender the Friends dream to a more pressing need to keep up with the daily grind.,So we can’t linger in coffee shops or spend the nights wailing Kum Bay Ya into the streets of the student ghetto, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t steal a moment to appreciate the chance to live with friends.,I’ve heard many students and alumni call the housemate tradition a hallmark of their years at Queen’s. The opposite of a commuter school, Queen’s breeds a sense of community with multi-person housing that fringes the campus borders.,Not that we haven’t all heard the stories about crazy housemates.

Don’t worry—I’ve got your back.,Some of you may be content going to a costume store and purchasing another sexy nurse, cat, or police officer outfit, and that’s fine. But if you’re a costume purist and Halloween enthusiast like me, here are a few tips I believe will lead you to the perfect DIY costume.,I believe the perfect costume must be a combination of many different components. Important among them is humor. I think humour and wit are some of the most important parts of a Halloween costume. If your costume makes people laugh, there’s no doubt it will be a hit at any party or gathering.,Subtlety is important to achieve the perfect amount of wit in your costume—you don’t want to go overboard and offend someone, but you also want to make sure people understand the joke without you hammering it over their heads. We get it, 2008. Sarah Palin is dumb.,The next important component to a costume is its relevance. In order for people to understand your costume, it should be up-to-date and something a wide group of people will understand and enjoy. I think relevance is an essential part of any costume, as well as an easy way to make it a standout. Dressing up as something people can easily relate to is a way to make sure your costume is one of the best in the bunch.,While you’re making your costume, it’s worth remembering although you want to be funny and up-to-date, the costume should look good on you as well. There’s no use going out as an Ugg boot, as funny as that may be, if no one can tell you’re a person under all that cardboard.,A good costume doesn’t have to go to extremes in order to elicit a response, and I firmly believe you can look good and have a standout Halloween costume at the same time. If Tina Fey has taught us anything, it’s that smart and sexy are not mutually exclusive. Most importantly, I think originality is vital to the success of your costume. If you wish to avoid being one of the many, it’s important to think outside the box in order to create something different and entertaining.,Although your costume might meet the criteria of being witty and relevant, it might be an overly-popular costume idea at the time. You could risk being one of 20 Michael Jacksons at a party.,To avoid this, it’s a good idea to ask around and see what other people are dressing up as, or to go for something slightly more obscure.,Finding the perfect Halloween costume is hard.

A plethora of views, values and choices contribute in many ways to our global awareness. But it also means there’s a plethora of views, values and choices one has to constantly keep in mind as a sort of obsessive-compulsive concern about being politically correct.,When I was writing about a study that measured attractiveness after alcohol—based on participants ranking others’ looks on a scale of one to seven— I found I couldn’t jokingly refer to such facts because rating looks on a numerical scale would offend some readers.,David Letterman and I found ourselves in the same sinking boat. When Letterman made a joke referring to Sarah Palin’s daughter being impregnated by New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, Palin, immediately offended by the comment, accused Letterman of referring to what happened to her daughter as rape. Forced to retract his comments, Letterman apologized for the ridiculous accusation. I wondered whether someone might mention to Palin that a woman, too, is capable of having a one-night stand. Offensive? Hardly. But it was deemed politically incorrect.,There are myriad such examples—the most obvious of which is the controversy over the Prophet Mohammed cartoons published in Denmark a few years back. The problem with political correctness isn’t at all its existence, but an irony that results in a nation with an obsession. Writing, speaking or living in fear of hurting anyone’s feelings becomes increasingly dominant with the countless number of opinions one has to consider—a task not unlike trying to dodge a thousand scattered pylons with a Hummer. Such constant neurotic political correctness results in the perpetuation of the thing its very existence is trying to protect.,The notion of freedom of speech has been driven to such an extreme that it actually jeopardizes those values we aim to uphold. When political correctness is forced to an extreme, it doesn’t stop issues like racism or sexism—it just sweeps them under the carpet.,Like Letterman, people in the media are constantly accused of being insensitive, and relentlessly forced to retract statements that offend certain groups whose opinions they neglect to factor in. Yet the unspoken truth is when people retract these statements or articles or ideas, it’s not that they have remorse. They do it according to an ultimatum of sorts. They either retract their beliefs or they will lose their jobs, their status—and must live with being labelled politically incorrect.,I’m not advocating racism, sexism or the ignorance of minority groups. I merely feel the obligation to point out the elephant in Room 101 of our Orwellian compulsion. There are blatantly offensive jokes that can’t be made because they are blatantly offensive, but there are also comments that mean no harm. Dissecting these comments on a microscopic level and inventing underlying meanings doesn’t create a politically correct opinion. Rather, it ceases to be an opinion at all and instead becomes an objective, forced and bland comment communicating absolutely nothing."},{"title":"Uncover suicide coverage","url":"/story/2009-09-22/editorials/uncover-suicide-coverage/","date":"September 22, 2009","content":"A law student at the University of Ottawa recently jumped to his death from the fifteenth floor of a residence building, the Globe and Mail reported Sept. 19.,Globe columnist André Picard cites media coverage of this young student’s death as an example of the tough ethical choice facing journalists responsible for covering suicides in the news.,Picard argues against guidelines like those provided by the Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA), which aim to discourage media outlets from publishing details of suicide stories that could lead to “copycat” attempts at self-harm.,He calls on journalists to seek a balance between respectful reporting and a thorough examination of the facts when dealing with delicate issues like suicide.,Although emotionally unnerving, exposing suicides in the news for what they are forms an integral part of the story of a person’s death.,The truth can be ugly, and it’s irresponsible journalism to avoid the facts in favour of public comfort.,The CPA’s suggestion to remove the abrasive term ‘suicide’ from news headlines is respectful and well intentioned, but won’t help the progress of mental health issues in Canada. It seems the benefits of raising public awareness for the issues that often underlie cases of suicide outweigh the potential dangers of publicizing suicide and fearing “copycat” behaviour.,The University of Ottawa’s student newspaper, the Fulcrum, is doing its students a disservice by avoiding use of the term “suicide” in their reporting of the incident.,In a university environment where mental pressures are high and support networks away from home can seem limited, it’s important to be aware mental health issues exist among our peers. Ignoring them can have devastating consequences.,The Fulcrum’s reticence to label the student’s death is best viewed not as a weakness, but as evidence that covering suicide in the news continues to be shrouded in ethical and moral debate. There’s a hazy line between disseminating the truth and disrespecting the deceased. As long as media outlets focus on the mental health causes of suicide issues rather than sensationalizing gory details in search of a story that sells, we will achieve a proactive and informative stance in addressing an issue that affects too many Canadians."},{"title":"Compliance not opt-outable","url":"/story/2009-07-28/editorials/compliance-not-opt-outable/","date":"July 28, 2009","content":"Members of a dissenting Hutterite community in northern Alberta who object to having driver’s licence pictures taken on religious grounds have been overruled, CBC News reported July 24.,The decision was reached after a four to three vote in the Supreme Court of Canada.,The Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony believe the provincial requirement for digital driver’s licence photos prevents them from freely practicing parts of their religion. Hutterites interpret the Bible’s second commandment, which states “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,” to mean they must avoid having pictures of themselves willingly taken. The Supreme Court’s ruling is an important measure against the risk of identity theft posed by licences lacking photos.,Granting the Wilson Colony Hutterites an exception to Alberta law would also set the precedent for other small groups to reasonably seek exemptions when their beliefs collide with established statutes.,Alternative methods of personal identification on licences, such as fingerprinting, may be more inclusive to religious groups like the Hutterites. But making province or nationwide concessions for a minority population seems exorbitant when considering the likely costs involved.,This situation highlights the joys and pains of living in a cultural mosaic like Canada. It’s commendable populations with unique religious beliefs can live side by side and resolve disagreements in a peaceful way through the democratic process.,At the same time, a multicultural country’s diverse population presents practical challenges when it comes to developing universally acceptable laws.,Part of living in a society is the agreement to live under one congruent set of laws. We shouldn’t expect our country to offer a bargaining system for rights and freedoms in which citizens can opt in and out of legal rules as they see fit.,In electing to drive, one chooses to comply with the rules of the road, including the necessity of having an identifying picture taken. The Hutterites of Wilson Colony face the reasonable choice of whether or not to apply for valid driver’s licences, as driving is a luxury rather than a necessity.,It seems the choice between a deep-seated religious conviction and the desire for four-wheeled convenience is clear as a digital photograph."},{"title":"Taxi trouble unreasonable","url":"/story/2009-09-25/editorials/taxi-trouble-unreasonable/","date":"September 25, 2009","content":"Montreal taxi driver Arieh Perecowicz will head to municipal court next week to fight for his freedom of expression after being instructed to remove several small personal artifacts from his taxicab, the Globe and Mail reported Sept. 22.

For example, cutting down on drivers’ use of cell phones while on the road is a more relevant area of concern than policing minor decorations.,The debate surrounding freedom of religious expression is an example of the divide between the public and private spheres, and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.,In this situation, Perecowicz’s decorations were subtle and posed no safety concerns. None of the artifacts extended to the backseat or affected the driver’s visibility. And a lack of any complaint from passengers suggests the objects weren’t offensive.,Keeping in touch with personal faith is a fundamental right in Canada and, within reason, holds more value as a freedom than enforcing blanket policies to keep cabs completely clutter-free.,While taxis provide a public service and customers should enjoy a professional ride, drivers like Perecowicz who spend close to 15 hours per day in their cars should be permitted to display subtle personal artifacts just as any other worker would in his or her office.,To express his spiritual convictions, Perecowicz isn’t breaching issues of security or requesting special privileges that would be costly or difficult to accommodate. The Bureau du Taxi shouldn’t be heartlessly asking this driver to remove or conceal what’s close to his heart."},{"title":"Social media can be classy","url":"/story/2009-09-15/editorials/social-media-can-be-classy/","date":"September 15, 2009","content":"The use of social media in the classroom is on the rise at Queen’s.

Sidney Eve Matrix’s FILM 240 class is among the pioneers of these new classroom methods.,Other professors prefer to keep things traditional and resist the use of social media in the classroom. Last year, Wayne Cox encouraged his POLS 261 students not to bring laptops to class in order to stay more engaged.,Both views on the use of technology and social media have merit, as good teachers are engaging regardless of the details of their teaching style. No matter how many gadgets and widgets a professor employs in the classroom, student attention can’t be guaranteed unless the professor is a naturally engaging teacher. The value of social media in the classroom depends on how professors think they can best convey information.,It’s ineffective to use social media simply to appear on the cutting edge of the Twitter trend, to procure a “wow” factor or to experiment with cool PowerPoint fade-in effects.,Professors may turn to social media in the classroom believing it will help students identify course material with their personal lives. While that’s an effective way to draw students in, excellent professors still shine regardless of how many YouTube videos and Twitter feeds they show in class.,Technology is what you make of it. It’s impressive Matrix’s teaching method involves applying for grants to experiment with which forms of technology, such as video recording, will be most helpful to students. Social media can also make class material more accessible to students with dominant visual or auditory learning styles.,At the same time, indulging the technology trend and staring out at a wall of students on their laptops can significantly change a classroom’s dynamic. Cox’s vow to put his full energy into laptop-free lectures is evidence professors can be engaging without the use of technology in class.,It’s difficult to measure student engagement accurately, but in the meantime it’s valuable to experiment with various teaching methods. Online discussion forums, electronic clickers, and instant in-class quiz results have revolutionized the way classes are conducted at Queen’s, and will likely continue to do so.

They include garbage collectors, daycare employees, paramedics and parks and recreation staff.,If a negotiation can’t be reached, Toronto will be served with a reminder of the summer of 2002, where garbage collectors walked off the job for 16 days before being served with back-to-work legislation from then Progressive Conservative premier Ernie Eves. The main issues at hand are job security and increased wages and benefits for union workers.,Toronto’s indoor and outdoor workers provide invaluable services to the city, but shaking down taxpayers for extra benefits by threatening to hold the city hostage is a counterproductive way to improve the already strained union-government relationship. Windsor is going into its 10th week of a strike by city workers, where the city is overun with long grass and piles of garbage. A similar strike in Toronto would have a devastating effect on an area with more than 2.5 million residents and would create unsanitary conditions for the crowded city. The strike will also negatively affect the city’s already struggling tourism industry and will have detrimental effects on pre-planned summer events, such as Toronto Pride Week.,City workers deserve to be properly compensated for their work, but asking for 18 bankable sick days, which can be cashed out at retirement for up to six month’s salary, creates $186-million in unfunded liability for the City, which is already working under a strained operating budget.,Instead of letting issues involving wage and benefits escalate to boiling point and engaging in hasty last-minute negotiations, both parties would benefit from year-round dialogue and negotiations to prevent the fear mongering that preceeds city-wide strikes.,Although both parties have their backs against the wall, striking is only a temporary solution that causes undue stress to union workers, the City and Toronto residents.

West seized the microphone and announced to the audience that Taylor’s competitor Beyoncé “had one of the best videos of all time.”,West was asked to leave the awards show soon afterwards.,An outburst of posts by Twitter users has surfaced since the incident, with many postings using racially-charged terms to dishonour West and his actions.,West’s choice to interrupt Swift’s speech was inappropriate and shows an arrogant lack of respect for both the young artist and the awards show.,Despite its insensitivity, West’s interruption doesn’t come close to meriting the abrasive outpour of racial slurs Twitter users have been tweeting his way. Viewers are justified in calling West out for his belief the urgency of his personal views trumps respecting the choice of an award show’s jury, but racist comments are intolerable. Responding with hatred is a far cry from a constructive search for mutual respect.,It’s deplorable for people to hide behind the anonymity cloak provided by technology while promulgating objectionable, racially-charged opinions. The use of ugly language with an ugly history to sensationalize trivial discontent with a pop artist is inexcusable.,However off-putting, West’s actions aren’t surprising. As a rising star in the tough rap music culture, West has learned to inhabit the persona of a self-made man who speaks his mind without fear.,At the end of the day, teen VMA viewers are likely to care less about who wins the award than the thrill of sensational gossip from stars acting out of line.

Buy a brightly coloured bike and buy some lights if you feel they are necessary. Bike shops in Kingston (of which there are at least four downtown) have options ranging from sub-$20 LED lights to bright headlights.,Despite all this, the cars are truly the rulers of the road.,Motorists need to acknowledge cyclists’ place on the street and be courteous.,This includes giving them enough room, changing lanes if possible and watching for cyclists when making a right turn or parallel parking.,If everyone on the streets used a bit more common sense and did some reading about bike laws in their area, cyclists and drivers would have a more pleasant relationship."},{"title":"Avoid Aberdeen, already","url":"/story/2009-09-25/editorials/avoid-aberdeen-already/","date":"September 25, 2009","content":"Last year Principal Tom Williams officially cancelled Homecoming, but that hasn’t stopped the Queen’s community from speculating if the dangerous and unsanctioned Aberdeen Street party will rear its ugly head again this weekend.

Police forces will be in the area to protect community safety and provide crowd control.,The Aberdeen Street party is unrelated to Homecoming’s greater purpose as a positive, spirit-building reunion weekend. It’s a shame the entire event had to change in response to the dangers of a careless party. With fewer safety measures in place, it’s important for students to be in control of their actions this weekend. Wandering in a crowd of inebriated high school students, known sexual predators and out-of-towners with no academic reputation,to protect is a recipe for disaster. Searching streets covered in broken glass for friends you’ve lost doesn’t make for a fun night out, either.,It’s up to us as students to withdraw from the Aberdeen Street situation and resist the temptation to be a bystander. The majority that attends the street party only to see the spectacle forms just as much a part of the problem as the few who intentionally cause trouble.,Students are the only ones who can effectively stand up against the lunacy of the fauxcoming party. No other authority has as much sway in convincing our peers than we, as friends and floormates, do. Our choices will make the greatest difference in curbing the danger. It’s likely this landmark year will set the tone for the future of the Aberdeen Street party, and the University should pay close attention to what unfolds.,It’s unfortunate the car-flipping, fist-fighting and bottle-smashing sparked by so few affects all of our reputations as Queen’s students. It’s on our shoulders to show the national media—who will undoubtedly be watching—that we’re not complete animals, but competent academics.,To Queen’s alumni, the Aberdeen Street party isn’t a tradition—it’s an embarrassment.

To achieve tenure, professors must strive to be considered valuable in their departments and published work is one of the few tangible ways to measure this success. It’s unfortunate a professor’s research makes him or her an asset to a university while teaching skills are considered secondary. But making blanket statements degrading professors’ willingness to put time and energy into their lecture-hall lifestyles is unwarranted.,There are professors who excel in the classroom and it’s refreshing to notice they care about their students’ learning. This level of teacher engagement encourages students to go the extra mile, too.,We shouldn’t let professors shoulder all the blame for incompetent students, either. In an academic climate where independence is valued, a student struggling with essay-writing should take advantage of the many resources offered on campus.,Wente’s observation that increasing numbers of classes are being taught by graduate students, rather than professors, is relevant. But because many grad students are on the career path to become professors, it seems logical they practise their instructing skills if we’re to expect any teaching savvy from professors of the future.,The academic world may have changed since Wente’s “golden age” when classes were smaller and professors were valued for their classroom charisma. But it’s passively retrospective to mourn the end of an idyllic, fairy-tale notion of education without considering modern pressures that mandate professors to churn out papers if they want to keep their jobs.,Perhaps universities should re-evaluate what institutions of higher learning prioritize, but it’s misguided to shoot the professors themselves, who are merely the messengers of academia’s modern face."},{"title":"GPA scale cuts the edge","url":"/story/2009-09-11/editorials/gpa-scale-cuts-edge/","date":"September 11, 2009","content":"In May 2011, Queen’s will implement a grade point average (GPA) system in addition to the existing letter grade system on student transcripts.,According to the Senate Committee on Academic Procedures, which proposed the change, 95 per cent of North American universities currently follow the GPA system.,The Commerce Society objected to the transition, with 98 per cent voting to maintain the hundred-based grade system currently in place. Regardless, the University Senate voted in favour of moving ahead with the change to a GPA scale.,Unifying Queen’s transcripts with the GPA system at other universities is a positive move toward a cohesive standard for evaluation. The system’s universality will benefit Queen’s students applying to graduate schools abroad.,It’s disappointing the GPA scale relies on a murkier granulation of grades than the current percentage-based system. When percentage grades ranging from 85 to 100 all fall into the GPA category of 4.0, it’s difficult to distinguish between top candidates.,For students in this top bracket, it’s hard to reconcile the large difference in study time required to move from a percentage grade of 85 to a grade of 100 with the reality that both intensities of effort end with identical results on a GPA-scale transcript.,But the range presented by the GPA scale isn’t all bad: it reflects the natural flux in a student’s performance. Just as having an essay marked by two different TAs would likely yield two different results demonstrates, the judgment of academic ability can be subjective and is better expressed as a range of performance, rather than a constant percentage.,The GPA scale naturally downplays the importance of exact academic rank, but this can also be seen as a way to place more emphasis on a candidate’s extracurricular activities and personal qualities when considering applications to graduate schools.,However accurate, the implementation of a GPA scale isn’t without its effects on academic motivation. Without the granulation of single percentage points, the competition for that one per cent edge disappears.,With the new GPA system our transcript format may become more universally identical, but the same shouldn’t be said for the way it will reflect our academic performance.,ComSoc held a vote at its annual general meeting on whether percentage grades should remain on transcripts, with 50 to 1 voting in favour of retaining numeric grades.,Incorrect information originally appeared in this article.,The Journal regrets the error."},{"title":"Obama spoke too soon","url":"/story/2009-07-28/editorials/obama-spoke-too-soon/","date":"July 28, 2009","content":"United States President Barack Obama said he regrets the language he used to comment on the issue of Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s arrest, the New York Times reported July 25.,Gates, a professor at Harvard University of African-American descent, was arrested for disorderly conduct July 16 by police at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Gates had been trying to force open his own jammed front door when neighbours reported his actions as a burglary.,Obama added fuel to the fire when he stated at a national news conference that the Cambridge policemen at the scene, led by Sergeant James Crowley, had “acted stupidly” in their treatment of the black professor—comments Obama rescinded two days later.,It’s admirable the President had the humility to admit he could’ve phrased his remarks better. He also had a noble motive in trying to draw attention to the topic of racial profiling, an issue that has global significance and personal relevance to Obama.,It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the President has emerged as a champion of the black cause; this should be expected based on his own ethnicity.,But Obama fell short when he chose to comment publicly on an issue before knowing all the facts. The President’s friendship with Professor Gates likely fuelled his quickness to comment and clouded his impartiality.,Although it’s commendable the President was looking to create a teachable moment out of the incident, the story would have made headlines and publicized racial profiling regardless of his intervention.,The public and the press are quick to criticize Obama for inappropriate speech. But these derisive attacks—foregrounded against the President’s usual tendency to be a gifted speaker who chooses his words carefully—only illustrate that we hasten to judge when he slips up.,Regrettably the emphasis on racial profiling in Gates’ arrest has quashed any debate about classism. We should also be questioning the skewed belief that it’s unreasonable for a Harvard professor to be subject to the possibility of arrest.,It’s lamentable neither President Obama nor Sergeant Crowley has come forth to apologize formally, although Obama has taken the lead by recanting his earlier comments in the interest of reducing controversy.,It’s clear from this incident that stereotypical connotations of race persist and that tolerance is sometimes only skin deep."},{"title":"All set for the swine flu","url":"/story/2009-09-18/editorials/all-set-swine-flu/","date":"September 18, 2009","content":"Canadian embassies abroad are stockpiling stores of antiviral drugs to combat the anticipated surge in cases of H1N1 influenza, the Toronto Star reported Sept. 12.,The Canadian federal government plans to buy 1,750 doses of the inhalable drug Relenza to add to the doses of Tamiflu already stockpiled.

Frequent public service reminders are likely to have a positive effect on behaviour.,At Queen’s, the effort to inform students is similarly admirable.

By installing cameras to monitor misbehaviour, the school presumes students will act out.,In-class surveillance cameras overstep the boundary between proper classroom conduct and personal behaviour development. When young students are aware they’re constantly being watched, it may have a negative effect on their psychological development.,Installing video cameras is a band-aid solution that records issues without getting to the bottom of them. It would be more valuable to investigate why misbehaviour occurs at Stockwell Park High. By putting the annual £60,000 towards investing in a breakfast program, making smaller classes or hiring a school psychiatrist, some of the potential underlying causes of behaviour problems would be addressed.,The in-class camera system also teaches students faulty lessons in morality by placing emphasis on the act of being caught. Stockwell Park High students may be paralyzed into good behaviour because they fear observation and punishment, rather than because they understand their actions are wrong.,Student-teacher relations may suffer as a result of the in-class surveillance system. By creating an “us versus them” mentality where teachers and their cameras are the behaviour wardens and students their inmates, it’s likely a less convivial relationship will develop between the two groups.,For hundreds of years, teachers have managed to cope with juvenile misbehaviour in the classroom.

Could there be some truth to the idea that working people look like their careers? And worse—as students, can we be pigeonholed so easily that we look the part of our chosen major?,Let’s consider this for a moment. Our university majors aren’t completely unlike our dogs: we spend time with them and learn to love them.

The idea of being witness to a period of time other than one’s own intrigued me and I soon wished I had my very own DeLorean to live out history (ideally, without putting my own existence in jeopardy).,In contrast, my life as a campus journalist is all about remaining current and relevant. News is often accused of being a fleeting entity without much room for retrospection and reflection. We see copies of newspapers in recycling bins and the odd garbage bin and think nothing of it. News changes with the times. However, a recent visit to the Queen’s Archives brought another important feature of the newspaper to light for me: its role as a future historical document.,The archives had always seemed mysterious to me, often referred to but never seen first-hand. I found them in Kathleen Ryan Hall, one of the buildings in the medical quadrangle behind Crane Building. As I entered, it was clear I’d crossed the threshold of a place not many had gone before.,I entered the large, empty, musky-smelling room full of aging books and wooden desk. I soon found signs of humanity and was directed to a friendly man named Paul, the resident archivist who would be catering to my historical needs. After telling him I came in search of old copies of the Journal for research for an article, he went to the back room and within minutes handed me four bound Journals from the 1940s and 1950s, apologizing that one was a little “worse for wear.” Scanning through the pages, I was suddenly confronted with what it means to be part of the “Queen’s tradition” this school prides itself on. From controversial AMS elections to Homecoming football games to the advent of the Grease Pole tradition, the articles allowed me to see previous generations of Golden Gaels through a more human lens and brought to light the historic legacy we’re all a part of.,Additionally, reading articles entitled “I’m the only girl in my science class” and op-eds debating the merits of co-ed residences on campus acted as a reminder of how much has changed over the last 50 to 60 years.,Whether you’re someone who reads campus publications religiously or just casually at Stauffer while waiting for a friend, the articles you read or skim will become a source of history for future generations of Queen’s students to scrutinize as they try to figure out what the PEC once stood for and what “A&P” was. More importantly, the events chronicled in campus publications—whether journalistic, satiric or editorial in form—allow us to reflect on issues that affect students told from the perspective of the students themselves. No other forum allows for that voice to be heard and chronicled like the student newspaper.,As I exited the Queen’s University archives, Paul encouraged me to come back if I ever needed to research. Without hesitation I told him I would, as a trip to archives may be the closest thing to a time-travelling DeLorean I’ll ever have."},{"title":"Maybe a ham, not a coconut","url":"/story/2009-09-25/editorials/maybe-ham-not-coconut/","date":"September 25, 2009","content":"This summer, someone called me a coconut, or brown on the outside and white on the inside. It pissed me off.,What does it mean to be a “coconut”?,Am I a coconut because I like hockey, listen to Great Big Sea and will chow down on a poutine at a moment’s notice? Is it because I speak English and French, not Hindi and Punjabi? Or is it because I think Red Green and Corner Gas are brilliant TV shows?,Frankly, I don’t call those white stereotypes. I call those Canadian stereotypes.,And that’s where I introduce today’s rant.,People who call me white, a coconut, a potato, or whatever ridiculous inanimate object falls into the same category, are more racist than the people they claim aren’t accepting them into Canadian culture.,First off, the many different varieties of “white” culture can’t be homogenized. A Pole has very little in common with a New Zealander, save maybe for skin colour (which is actually probably slightly different, too). They have different foods, languages, histories and religions. Their ways of life are entirely different. So how can they be one and the same?,If people get upset over someone thinking their family’s Pakistani when they’re Indian, or someone thinking they’re Chinese when they’re Korean, then they ought never to homogenize white people, either.,Secondly, if people are going to complain about not being integrated cleanly into Canadian society, let me give them a few hints. If one chooses to separate themselves from society, it will be difficult for them to integrate. If one spends a large amount of time questioning the validity of a society, it will be difficult for them to integrate. If one spends their time talking about how little they want to be part of a given society, wanting instead to be part of the society their parents left behind, it will be difficult for them to integrate.,Lastly, people who make sweeping assumptions about Canadians are just as bad as the people who call me a Paki. By the same token, when one makes sweeping assumptions about who I am based on the colour of my skin, they’re as ignorant as the people who call me a Paki.,I’m not going to get into the issue of privilege because, unlike many people I’ve come across in the past month or so, I don’t happen to think white males are the devil. It seems mighty discriminatory to lump all people who fit into that category under a specific set of characteristics. In my experience, the people who’ve made sweeping generalizations about me have been brown and of all genders. White males have been extremely accepting of me.,There’s a distinct Canadian culture which so many children of immigrants decide to ignore, choosing instead to be party to the culture their parents left behind. Fine. I don’t hold it against you if you want to have pride in your heritage, but I simply ask to be left alone to celebrate my Canadian-ness."},{"title":"Summer school musings","url":"/story/2009-06-23/editorials/summer-school-musings/","date":"June 23, 2009","content":"Think back. Think way back to high school. It’s May, it’s 20 degrees outside and there isn’t a cloud in the sky. It’s a perfect day to relax outside and maybe attempt to get that elusive tan, right?,There’s a catch, though: you have an essay due the next day.,For many people, the perils of warm weather schoolwork seem to be nothing but a distant memory.,Back in high school, summer school meant you were either a slacker or an overambitious keener. It was a relatively taboo phenomenon. Since I fell in neither category, the only previous exposure to summer school I had came from Saved By the Bell. However, as a result of changing programs halfway through my undergraduate career, summer school suddenly became not just an option, but a necessity.,I’ve always been an independent learner, and with that in mind I thought signing up for an American history correspondence course over the summer would be a fun change of pace from traditional in-class academia.,It was with this optimism that I started my first day of tank top academia from the comfort of my parents’ living room in Bolton, Ontario. I couldn’t wait to fill my head with stories of revolutionary battles and political power play. I had visions of studying while lying on my backyard deck listening to my iTunes playlist, and I thought with a month and a half off before I started my summer job I could even get ahead with my readings. Besides, I was living at home. What else did I have to do with myself?,Surprisingly, home had a lot to offer. I began reconnecting with high school friends who also found themselves stuck at home and found various means of escape by visiting friends in other cities. I never went anywhere without my courseware and textbook, but there was certainly no time for studying on the road. Even while I was at home, I discovered the joy of mid-afternoon showers and began to enjoy the bitchy banter of The View.,What can explain my recent flirtation with summertime slackerdom? I blame it on excessive free time. As university students, we are constantly told to be busy and productive in order to become successful. This culture is especially prevalent here at Queen’s, where we have high academic pressures and we’re also expected to load up on extracurricular activities. It was through a taste of carefree, unemployed bliss that I reacquainted myself with the idea of rest—something I forgot existed during the school year. However, I also learned its dangers. The more time you have, the less you get done. It’s a sad but true paradox.,Now that I’m about halfway through my course, I’m proud to say that I’ve almost caught up with my readings. I’m not ahead like I had planned, but I guess I can’t be too hard on myself.

My first tweet? “I am eating pie in bed. Is this what ‘news’ has come to?” Apparently so—but according to some, I was voluntarily diminishing my vocabulary because of “impatience with more complicated modes of discourse” and succumbing to “thought control” at the hands of a criminal mastermind based in California.,Lately, the blogosphere has been aflutter discussing Twitter’s influence on modern-day language, likening the micro-blogging service to Newspeak, the fictional language from George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four that aims to control the way people think. By removing synonyms and antonyms in favour of monosyllabic words that double as both a noun and a verb, dictionaries will effectively slim down and the need for deep thought diminishes.,Oh, and did I mention I’m changing my name to Julia?,According to blogger Yves Smith of nakedcapitalism.com, the comparison of Twitter to Newspeak stems from users’ willingness to dumb down their thoughts, creating a culture intolerant of longer prose pieces that require the use of the scroll button.,Indeed, Twitter’s most fascinating feature is its transparent simplicity, aiming to solve the “information overload traditionally associated with online communication” by giving users control over who sees their updates, whose updates they receive and how much time they wish to devote to tweeting. Not so, says Smith, who argues that Twitter’s 140-character rule makes it impossible to communicate anything “complicated or nuanced” and feeds an “addiction” and “false sense of urgency,” sacrificing human relationships for instant gratification and giving it a distinctly Orwellian aura.,Okay, Smith has a point. But is Twitter really diminishing our vocabulary with every tweet into total oblivion by 2050?,Despite Twitter being an attractive time waster and a model for compulsively jotting down one’s thoughts, I doubt my ability to command the English language articulately has been diminished by choosing to condense my thoughts into 140 characters or less on occasion. Also, unlike the totalitarian-driven concept of Newspeak, signing up for and using Twitter is completely voluntary. Most importantly, Twitter is what you make of it. Like all guilty pleasures—alcohol, junk food, going to Stages—it’s meant as an escape, a sidebar to a life otherwise filled with healthy doses of reality and a full vocabulary.,Whether the skeptics like it or not, Twitter continues to be a powerful and popular communication tool for everyone from celebrities to professors and students to soccer moms. Besides, let’s face it: Orwell would probably have a Twitter account if he were still alive, and you would totally follow him. Orwellian mind control tool or not, I plan to keep micro-blogging my deep thoughts about Betty White, obnoxious bar-goers and my under-the-covers adventures with pie.

There’s also an implicit suggestion women shouldn’t desire to do other things before they’ve finished their household chores.,The article also fails to account for the reality that not all women own washing machines, but all women desire some form of liberation.,It seems incongruous to compare a domestic machine to something like the Pill, as one technology reinforces women’s socially constructed roles and the other gives them more control over their own sexuality.,But even more problematic is the Vatican’s assumption that women’s liberation can be defined by a single object when women’s thoughts—and, indeed, feminist ideology—represent a multiplicity of ideas.,In the same way a distinction must be made between the Catholic Church’s patriarchal leadership and Catholic people who may be liberal and modern, it’s time for people to get rid of the archaic notion that women are homogenous."},{"title":"No-tuition model too elitist","url":"/story/2009-03-19/editorials/no-tuition-model-too-elitist/","date":"March 19, 2009","content":"Columnist Heather Mallick proposed abolishing tuition fees to keep university enrolment down in a CBC News analysis and viewpoint article Feb. 27.,Mallick argues that universities have lowered their standards.

In the current economic environment, more people are turning to higher education as an investment for future security and, instead of limiting students’ opportunities, people should look at making education more accessible to a greater number of people.,There appears to be a trend of employers requiring at least an undergraduate degree in order for an applicant to be competitive.,Beginning in Ontario high schools, students are streamed into university or college programs, with university usually seen as the intellectually superior path.,But the learning and living experiences college students also receive shouldn’t be underestimated. College programs, which simply have a different, more hands-on teaching style, shouldn’t be stigmatized.,High-school students should be encouraged to go into programs that complement their learning style. That way, instead of limiting students who want to attend university from doing so, it’s likely fewer students would apply for university in the first place.,Students should be charged a minimal amount in tuition so they have bargaining power to hold their university accountable for providing a high-quality education.,Mallick brings up interesting ideas to reform the university system but loses them in her elitism.,Instead of prioritizing university, the focus should shift to making all post-secondary education accessible and valuable."},{"title":"Selling jobs won’t pay off","url":"/story/2009-02-26/editorials/selling-jobs-wont-pay/","date":"February 26, 2009","content":"Some charity organizations and for-profit companies are auctioning off unpaid student internships, the Globe and Mail reported Feb. 3.,CharityFolks.com, for instance, offers lucrative internships in many industries, at companies such as Elle Magazine or the New York Stock Exchange—starting at $1,500.

Voices are being heard. Although such protests imply there are issues that must be dealt with, the organized reactions of individuals also suggest a hope for progress.,This week, I felt empowered. I was permitted to clap my hands rather than bitterly point my finger at stories of hypocrisy, treachery and violence. ,Media should focus not only on shocking or horrifying their audience, but also on allowing readers to celebrate. ,In an age where censorship is increasingly frowned upon, it appears there’s a double standard for what is suppressed by the media. As readers, do we demand the right to be informed not only of economic crises but also of heartwarming events? ,According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, censorship is “the practice of officially examining books, movies, etc., and suppressing unacceptable parts.” Unfortunately, publications often give preference to a frowning readership instead of one cheering with pompoms and yellow-striped batons. ,If non-censorship is to be praised, it is also to be fully exercised. ,I was provoked by author Eugene H. Peterson’s statement that “a writer has far more imaginative material to work with in presenting a bad character than a good person. […] Good people, virtuous lives, mostly seem a bit dull.” Indeed, readers and writers are more frequently captivated by a front-page story of a monstrous gunman’s criminal charges than that of a woman’s courage in facing breast cancer. ,Personally, I also find it more difficult to praise than to criticize.,Good writers, however, should be capable of stimulating and maintaining the interest of readers with both good and bad news. ,Contemporary media reflect a societal trend that favours celebrity gossip magazines, melancholy music and fiercely-competitive reality TV shows. As a result, literature caters to the taste of an audience that ironically delights in misfortune.,Criticism is no historical novelty. This week, I found myself flinging my Restoration and 18th-Century English literature anthology on my desk because I couldn’t handle reading another cynical poem about humanity’s endless and unalterable cycle of doom. ,Although I agree that life is unfair and disheartening, I also think I would miss out on a great deal if I failed to appreciate examples of human success and genuine philanthropy. ,I won’t, and don’t want to, be completely satisfied with the state of society, but I still want to celebrate.,Don’t censor my smile. "},{"title":"Apparel lie lets us down","url":"/story/2009-03-27/editorials/apparel-lie-lets-us-down/","date":"March 27, 2009","content":"Last week, Queen’s No Sweat obtained documents showing that not all pieces of Queen’s Athletics apparel are made in Canada, contrary to the University’s claim when it signed a contract with adidas in September.,According to the documents, 162 of the 342 items are produced by Saxon Manufacturing in Brantford, Ontario, and the remaining 180 items are produced in factories in Asia and South America.,It’s disappointing the office of student affairs would try to pull the wool over our eyes after promising that athletics uniforms would be produced in Canada.,Dean of Student Affairs Jason Laker said it’s a question of semantics, because athletes’ uniforms are made in Canada and the items produced internationally are training gear. But because athletes are mandated to only wear the new adidas gear, they essentially have uniforms for on and off the playing field.,Varsity athletes were required to purchase new training gear and uniforms with the adidas logo.,One of the reasons Queen’s didn’t re-sign the contract with Russell Athletics was ostensibly due to concerns about the unethical treatment of factory employees in El Salvador, where Russell outsourced the production of some of its garments.,Although manufacturing items in Canada doesn’t guarantee they were made under fair working conditions, and overseas factories may not necessarily have poor working conditions, the Canadian manufacturing agreement was something of a compromise for the University not signing onto the designated suppliers program that promotes ethical purchasing.,But it becomes harder to justify the switch from an ethical perspective if adidas’ practices are now being called into question.,Perhaps adidas was a more ethical option than Russell; it may also have been that adidas was chosen simply to raise the University’s profile.

Indonesian authorities are also considering stopping vaccination programs because they’re worried foreign drug companies are using the Indonesian population as test subjects.,The worry that childhood vaccines cause autism has even decreased the rate of vaccination in North America.,I have no way of knowing if these worries are justified, but I sincerely hope they aren’t.,Although I’m a strong believer in the right of autonomy over your body, and don’t want to see what little freedom people are given diminished, refusing vaccinations affects more than just specific individuals.,Part of the vaccination program is the eradication of certain diseases. Once people refuse to be vaccinated these diseases become more prevalent, because there are more people who are susceptible to them. The result is a major health risk that is, theoretically, completely avoidable.,The public needs more education on where the vaccines come from and what the pros and cons of vaccinations are.,To protect both the health and choices of people worldwide, drug companies, governments and health care workers need to restore people’s faith in vaccinations, and they need to do it soon."},{"title":"I’ll do it after this game","url":"/story/2009-02-26/editorials/ill-do-it-after-game/","date":"February 26, 2009","content":"I was going to use this space to discuss graffiti in bathroom stalls, but then decided I didn’t care enough.,Then I thought to use it to talk about racism on campus, but I’ve already done that.,Then I played NHL on XBOX 360 for a while and it dawned on me that I would write on a matter of grave importance, which affects my personal, academic and professional lives—wasting time playing video games.,I bought NHL and Madden 09 at the start of the year and it was the worst decision I’ve ever made.

Her philosophy, posted on her blog, says it all: “A great handbag can save any outfit.” Still, with over 100 jobs on her CV—including three visits to the Olympics and a stint in the military—the 11-inch doll is ahead of me financially.,As I try to keep the final weeks of undergrad from slipping between my fingers—unlike Barbie, I have opposable thumbs—I can’t help but wish I had my own life philosophy and sure success coming my way.,Instead, I might be kicking back in a cardboard box next year. As far as I know, Mattel has never released Financially-Strapped-Grad-Student Barbie.,My Barbies, though, did live in a rather modest cardboard house, which often needed masking tape repairs. As the clan increased, some were relegated to shoebox condos.,Mattel clearly has marketing prowess: Recession Barbie, anyone? Now that Barbie has had a so-called realistic facelift, perhaps it’s time for her to put the credit card down.,The years I spent with Barbie weren’t detrimental to my development as an individual. Other, real-life role models can have greater effects on a girl’s development.,For me, Barbie represented a means of creative storytelling; she encouraged me to spend hours acting out the narrative of a happy, successful and independent woman.,Can’t such a woman like pink, plastic shoes—in moderation?"},{"title":"Firing intern hypocritical","url":"/story/2009-06-23/editorials/firing-intern-hypocritical/","date":"June 23, 2009","content":"Matt McCann, an intern at the New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal, was fired in May after writing a story about staff at the University of New Brunswick upset at giving Premier Shawn Graham an honourary degree, CBC News reported June 5.,The Telegraph-Journal ran the story on its front page, but fired McCann the next day.,McCann told CBC that the newspaper’s editor told him the story was unbalanced and had damaged the good working relationship the paper had established with the University.,The Telegraph-Journal didn’t comment on the decision, saying it’s an internal matter.,It’s hypocritical to fire an intern when the newspaper’s senior staff chose to publish the story anyway.

They aren’t about punishing small mistakes. It’s even more alarming that the newspaper appears more concerned with maintaining a good relationship with the University than one of its own staff.

The other grants available to student groups fall far short of the amount the Coca-Cola contract provides.,A lot of the money has gone to student clubs advocating for social justice.,Although the benefits Coke’s money provides on campus doesn’t excuse its human rights abuses elsewhere, students advocating for Coca-Cola’s removal need to present viable alternatives for clubs, library and athletics funding.,If the University opts for another cold beverage company, it’s likely it will sign with another well-branded company.,Other large beverage companies, such as Pepsi, may also have spotty human rights records. Queen’s should use its bargaining position to demand more transparency in Coke’s operations.

She said the SGPS executive is also considering restoring the fee to its original $81.20. If the fee remains at $0, graduate students won’t be able to use any athletics facilities beginning Sept. 1.,It’s frustrating that a minority of students were allowed to make a decision for the majority because of what appears to be an overall attitude of disinterest among graduate students.,Although it was irresponsible for only seven per cent of graduate students to vote in the referendum, the University needs to take the message they’re sending seriously because their disengagement affects others in the Queen’s community as well.,If the athletics fee isn’t restored, the department may be forced to cut back on some programs, and undergraduate students risk having a further increase tacked onto their fee in the future.,But Athletics and Recreation must also shoulder some of the blame for the fee failure.,Although the department did a good job involving students in the consultation process to set the fee increase, the department has neither marketed the fee increase well outside of the PEC nor geared advertisements specifically at graduate students’ use of the facilities.,It’s disappointing that the University tends to focus on graduate students’ research dollars instead of asking what they want to get out of their graduate experience.,Queen’s should begin looking at the broader issue of how to engage SGPS students in all aspects of student life.,Ultimately, though, it’s up to the graduate students to take initiative in expressing what a majority of them want.,Graduate students already have a Class A vocabulary of apathy, ambivalence and alienation; let’s hope they can find a space to include athletics as well."},{"title":"Food fight foolish, not fun","url":"/story/2009-03-27/editorials/food-fight-foolish-not-fun/","date":"March 27, 2009","content":"On Mar. 17, St. Patrick’s Day, some students participated in a food fight in Leonard cafeteria.,Residence and Hospitality Services Director Bruce Griffiths said he hired extra staff this year to patrol the cafeteria on St. Patrick’s Day.,In 2007, a St. Patrick’s Day food fight caused $4,300 in damages.,Griffiths said there were no major damages this year, but students continued a dangerous trend of throwing cutlery, glasses and furniture along with food.,Participating in a food fight is a disgusting display of entitlement, and unacceptable behaviour for university-age students.,The food that was wasted could have gone to people on campus and in the Kingston community who struggle to pay for food on a daily basis.,It’s disappointing that the food fight this year was, as in previous years, a planned event; first-year students should not see this type of activity as an annual event or something to be proud of.,There are reports that cafeteria staff felt physically threatened and some students were injured when cutlery or glass was thrown around.,Instead of Queen’s shouldering the burden of cleaning up the mess and paying for the damages, individual students who are involved in food fights should be fined, or have their meal plans taken away.,Queen’s must use a combination of preventive education, such as having dons talk about the issue to their floors, and strong consequences to send participants a zero-tolerance message.,The University must also question whether food fights are a result of too much or too little freedom in residence.,But, ultimately, first-year students who ask to be treated like adults must first act like them.,The University has a tendency to deny a problem exists with the hope it will go away, but it must step in before more serious injuries occur.

On bad days I still curse the damp, bone-chilling Kingston wind, dodge getting splashed by cars on Brock Street as I grumble about some ridiculously small failed expectation and worry that my finely-honed jay-walking skills could lead to disaster should I move to a bigger city.,However, looking back at what has been an anxiety-plagued, yet fruitfully fun, year with an uncomfortably sincere sigh is, perhaps, a little easier than Thinking About Deep Shit and Asking Big Questions About The Future. But one thing I’ve ascertained is that I have trouble envisioning my life without school. This both settles and unsettles me. I’ve been educationally institutionalized for so long, I twitch nervously when I don’t have a stack of books to read.,Clearly there is life after undergrad just as there is life without it. And due to these Difficult Economic Times many of my scientifically-inclined peers are discovering that despite the $60,000 investment over four years there may not be a stable place for them in the wide world—just as humanities students have it rubbed into their faces during frosh week. University isn’t necessarily the smartest route after all. But much as I’d like to entertain thinking outside the classroom, I find myself coming back to it. Since I’ve signed up for the next step and another one to two years, how to justify my decision to stay in school next year? Hanging out with words is allegedly one of my strengths and maybe I’m not adventurous or creative enough to think to do anything different. I know I’m extremely privileged to have this option, but unlike those students who, in a study by the University of California, Irvine, claimed they expected decent marks just for showing up, I’ve also worked for it.,These students’ sentiments are trickily in line with the obnoxiously classist Globe and Mail columnist Margaret Wente’s take on our generation as “trophy children” (read: coddled over-achievers who grow up believing they can do anything and are applauded for participation). I still maintain that any actual self-respecting and -deprecating over-achiever has a more heightened sense of self-awareness than Ms. Wente herself seems to possess.,The phrase “It’s a good time to stay in school” gets thrown around a lot. Somehow this sage advice just isn’t enough for me. I guess I’m torn between stabbing at practicality and harbouring big dreams. One sassy and brilliant professor offered me this simple reflection: undergrad is one of those times that, in retrospection, you have to work on self-improvement.

I have just finished writing my longest essay of the year for the least interesting class and, in desperation, I’m surfing the Internet for a scrap of entertainment that can mask my fatigue.,Surprisingly, an article by Molly Fischer, of the Yale Daily Press, did the job. Fischer writes that the Yale experience is portrayed unrealistically and inaccurately in pop culture.,From the point of view of outsiders looking in, the school’s place in the world is privileged and glamorous, coloured with ivory towers and ivy-covered buildings. The students are preppy, elitist WASPs and resemble characters such as Gossip Girl’s Blair Waldorf. Realistically, she notes, it’s not like that.,But when a university like Yale is a luxury name akin to brands such as Prada and BMW, reading about how students view their school represented in pop culture is like reading about someone who knowingly turns down compliments in an effort to be modest. It’s both weird and mildly touching to observe, but ultimately an exercise in exhibitionism. It’s showing off inadvertently.,That said, how much of the school’s reputation and image is really a reflection of its students? Is being a “Yalie” the same thing as being a student at Yale?,And is Queen’s any different, when we have certain disillusioned principals who, in an effort to salvage public relations, dub Queen’s a “Canadian Ivy League” school? (Which it isn’t.),In other words, is attending Queen’s and calling oneself a Gael an implicit attempt at labeling one’s educational background as an expensive cultural accessory? Are we using our school as a brand name to indicate the values and talents we share with society?,Our educational background does, to an extent, give way to accounting for our social status; it’s unavoidable as members of a Western capitalist structure. But to conjure an image of the Queen’s experience is dangerous when combined with the false pretense that it genuinely represents our talents and successes.,It borders on a lie, and engages us in self-deception by turning our experiences here into a status symbol. We become naïve by thinking any “Queen’s degree” gained is an accurate sign of our employability or intelligence, giving way to a sense of entitlement and a misinformed sense we can win everything.,It is, dare I say, very stupid to think so. A student attending Queen’s is diverse and variable in his or her talents and abilities, and this should hardly be reduced to the university he or she studied at for four years.,Our undergraduate experience is nothing more, nor less, than a starting point for further learning.

I am enjoying the beginning of my summer in the beautiful province of Québec, specifically in a medium-sized village named Chicoutimi, about 300 km north of Québec City.,It’s a shame such a wonderful part of our country is so socially divided from its fellow provinces. For well over two centuries, Canada has struggled with the task of reconciling the fundamental differences of language and culture between its English and French inhabitants. I don’t think this is going to change anytime soon.,However, the stark cultural differences that existed a hundred years ago have largely been blurred. We’re not arguing over which church to call home anymore. And who doesn’t love poutine?,What divides Québec from the rest of Canada today is language. Anyone can graduate from the public school system in every province except Québec without being able to say more than “bonjour.” Some bilingual country we have.,In a world that’s becoming increasingly connected, multilingualism is an incredibly valuable skill. But it is ultimately a public good, so everyone has a disincentive to invest in it despite its universal benefits. It would be great if all Canadians could speak French, but few make the effort to learn it themselves.,This is where our government should come in. Since every Canadian, and Canada as a whole (including Québec, of course), benefits from being bilingual, our public education system should prepare us enough to be able to converse in both languages. But there isn’t enough pressure on our politicians to enforce such regulations in our curriculum.,I think people would advocate for better French education more strongly if they had faith that our public system were capable of making us bilingual. The curriculum needs two drastic improvements: it has to start earlier and it has to be more immersive. You can’t learn a language by conjugating verbs, and once you get older, learning the basics becomes exponentially more difficult.,Other countries teach second languages very well. I’ve met many people from Europe and South America who speak English fluently, and they only learned it in public school.,If other education systems can teach a completely foreign language, there should be no reason why we can’t teach an official one.,By the end of my course here, I hope to be able to confidently say that “je parle français.” And while the personal satisfaction of learning another language is extraordinary, I wish learning French in Canada were a standard requirement rather than an individual endeavor.,I don’t blame people for not learning French, because learning a language is hard.

citizens have a right to know how their information is tracked.,The state acted rightly to charge them in order to discourage other teens looking to do the same thing.,Child pornography laws were designed to protect children and, although the teenagers may think of themselves as adults, their poor judgement shows they continue to need the law to protect them.,The state shouldn’t begin modifying the law’s definition and should apply it strictly in all cases to prevent harm to children.,Although the girls meant for only the boys to see the photos, there’s a possibility they could have been distributed more widely and fallen into the hands of someone intent on exploiting them.,It would be difficult to follow through with the charges because the teens’ careless mistake doesn’t seem to merit the tough sentences adults convicted of trafficking child porn receive.,Although the teens shouldn’t face jail time for their actions, they should be fined or given community service hours in order to show them the severity of their actions.,It’s unlikely these teens will repeat their mistake.,According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy’s study last month, ‘sexting,’ or the act of sending explicit photos through cellphones, is a growing trend and the state shouldn’t put the onus solely on parents to monitor their children’s behaviour.,Celebrity culture encourages teens to act irresponsibly and the state, which allows the media to disseminate highly-sexualized images, should have a role in teaching teens safe Internet and cellphone use.,What seems like merely a stupid mistake may be indicative of a growing problem among oversexed teens and the state should take care to uncover all the case’s implications."},{"title":"Limit mark-ups, not prices","url":"/story/2009-02-11/editorials/limit-mark-ups-not-prices/","date":"February 11, 2009","content":"According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation’s (HSF) new report, the price for healthy foods varies widely across Canada, the Globe and Mail reported Feb. 10.,The HSF asked volunteers from 66 communities across the country to shop at national or regional grocery chain stores for items listed in the federal government’s national nutritious food basket. The findings suggest a person’s geographical location may contribute to difficulties in keeping a healthy diet.,The report included survey results that indicate 40 per cent of those surveyed have chosen not to buy a healthier option because of cost and 80 per cent want the federal government to regulate the price of nutritious foods.,Although the alarming growth in obesity rates suggests it’s necessary for the government to act in the best interests of citizens’ health, price regulation is an unreliable and logistically difficult system to implement.,Without having more research to corroborate the HSF’s findings, it’s difficult to determine if there’s a correlation between lowering food prices and healthier eating.,People who are used to making unhealthy purchases because they’re cheaper may not automatically switch to buying healthier foods simply because the prices have been lowered, and a price regulation program would have to be accompanied by an extensive health education campaign to encourage healthy eating and exercise.,Health Canada would also have to create a list of nutritious foods to be regulated, taking into account the diversity of dietary patterns in Canada.,With the different brands available in grocery stores, it would be difficult to set standard prices for items.,The cost of food items is also determined by their transportation costs, and regulating the cost means some areas would benefit more than others.,In order to account for regions’ different geography, income levels and costs of living, it might be more beneficial to consider provincial price regulation or regulating store mark-ups, not specific prices.,The government should encourage people to buy local, in-season produce, which is often healthier because it contains fewer preservatives and cheaper because it limits transportation costs.,It’s encouraging that people are seeking ways to eliminate the socioeconomic hierarchy at the grocery store, but they must find a viable alternative to price regulation.,Keep chewing on it."},{"title":"Don’t play lone Woolf","url":"/story/2009-02-02/editorials/dont-play-lone-woolf/","date":"February 2, 2009","content":"Daniel Robert Woolf will become Queen’s 20th principal this September, Board of Trustees Chair Bill Young announced last Wednesday.,Woolf was chosen by an 18-person committee, made up of Board members, University administration and student leaders, to replace Principal Tom Williams.,Woolf, a Queen’s alum, is currently dean of the faculty of arts at the University of Alberta, where he’s a history professor.,His son is a first-year student at Queen’s.,Woolf said he wants to increase international recognition of the University.,Based on the background information the committee has provided on Woolf, he seems to be a good fit for the University.,Former principal Karen Hitchcock, who came to Queen’s from a U.S. university, lacked personal experience with Queen’s spirit, which showed in her detachment from student life. Woolf, on the other hand, will have the benefit of both his and his son’s undergraduate experiences to show him what needs to be done at the University.,Woolf’s arts background—a contrast to Hitchcock’s doctorate in anatomy and cell biology—may help the University focus more on arts programs, which have become neglected in recent years in favour of expanding Queen’s science and business programs.,But it’s worrisome that one of Woolf’s priorities is increasing the University’s international recognition. His rhetoric sounds disturbingly similar to Hitchcock’s “engaging the world” plan that shifted her focus from students’ to outsiders’ opinions.,Woolf should realize dealing properly with internal issues will send a positive message about Queen’s to the world.,Although he should work with Williams and use some of his good ideas, Woolf shouldn’t repeat the mistake of his predecessor by making far-reaching decisions, such as cancelling Homecoming, without proper student consultation.,He should spend his first few months getting face-to-face interaction with students, faculty and senior administration to re-familiarize himself with the University.,Woolf is young and seems to have a fresher outlook than former principals.

In response, newspapers have cut down on staff, foreign bureaus, circulation and the size of their issues.,Coll suggests raising endowments to operate newspapers so that, released from the pressures of having to generate revenue from ads and circulation to sustain themselves, newspapers could more freely pursue stories and retain full editorial autonomy.,The New York Times, owned by the New York Times Company, runs a yearly deficit that’s subsidized by the company’s other units. The Times has won 96 Pulitzer Prizes and Citations for journalism, more than any other American newspaper.,Although the non-profit model works well theoretically, it would be difficult to realistically implement.,Coll writes that the Post requires a $2-billion endowment to sustain its operations indefinitely; a figure representing roughly five per cent of its owner’s net worth.,If the newspaper manages to find someone, or a group of individuals, willing to contribute such a huge amount, it’s unlikely the endowment would be given without an expectation of some control over the newspaper’s editorial content.,Fighting accusations of partisanship reflects badly on newspapers as a whole and is just as detrimental to the industry as falling ad revenue.,If donors do relinquish full editorial control, however, an endowment system would allow newspapers to pursue more in-depth stories, revive their foreign bureaus—giving them first-hand access to international news—and free them from the ups and downs of the advertising market.,But operating on endowments isn’t a foolproof way of avoiding the recession, as universities—which run on endowments—have recently proven.,If a non-profit model allows extended coverage, newspapers would have to take care to remain relevant in their coverage.,It’s heartening that Coll, and others in the newspaper industry, are seeking creative measures to revive the industry.

Unless the AMS is prepared to renegotiate the agreement entirely, withholding money for a specific amount of time—only to eventually contribute it—is little more than a politically polarizing move.,It’s counterintuitive to withhold students’ contribution if the University stops construction in order to raise money, or for some other equally responsible reason.,The AMS signed the MOU with the knowledge it was risky, as construction proposals often change, and students should be prepared for reworked plans.,It’s unwise for the AMS to allocate resources without expert knowledge in where the money would be best used.,It’s unfair to blame the administration for not delivering on their promises and simultaneously try to force a deadline for the construction.,The University should take the necessary amount of time to properly finance the project and build it well. If it means the buildings will live up to the students’ expectations, an extended deadline is time well spent.,The AMS doesn’t appear to have fully considered the implications of its actions, such as what to do in the event that it collects student money and later decides to withhold it.,Instead of fomenting the situation, the AMS should give the administration some time before prematurely forcing its hand."},{"title":"Veggie ad distasteful, fun","url":"/story/2009-01-29/editorials/veggie-ad-distasteful-fun/","date":"January 29, 2009","content":"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)’s commercial for this Sunday’s Super Bowl has been banned by network NBC for being too sexual, the UK Guardian reported Jan. 28.,The ad features lingerie-clad women licking and rubbing various vegetables and the words, “Studies show vegetarians have better sex.” NBC’s advertising standards executive Victoria Morgan said the ad “depicts a level of sexuality exceeding [NBC’s] standards” and asked PETA to edit racy portions of the commercial, including a shot of a woman licking a piece of broccoli while holding her hand over her breast.,It’s surprising NBC would make this move as the commercial is no more degrading to women than many other ads that air during the Super Bowl.,PETA has gained a reputation for questionable ads—such as one comparing the murder of Tim McLean on a Greyhound bus last summer to animal slaughtering—and it’s possible NBC didn’t want to give the organization, usually perceived as militant, primetime coverage.,But it seems out of character for a network to refuse an ad by a group able to pay for the highly coveted spot.,Perhaps the network found the ad distasteful and is trying to reshape the Super Bowl’s image, which has gained notoriety for highly sexual commercials and halftime shows.,Preventing the PETA ad from airing might attract a wider audience and reach out to children who enjoy watching the sport.,If the network is trying to clean up its programming, the ad ban must be seen as a first step and NBC should review other Super Bowl commercials as well.,PETA’s ad is so outrageous it can be interpreted as tongue in cheek. It’s possible the group meant it as a critique of the extensive use of sex in advertising.,The ad could be interpreted as empowering for women because there are no men in the commercial and the women are taking their sexuality into their own hands, literally.

To make it more relevant, schools should consider playing the anthem selectively, such as at sporting events, where it will serve its purpose of evoking community pride.,Although an anthem is an important symbol of having a common identity, it’s necessary to question the image it projects.,If the anthem continues to be played in schools, educators should teach children about the country’s history from an early age and allow them to decide for themselves whether the anthem is an appropriate expression of their Canadian identity.,It’s unfair to force a brand of nationalism on children—one that’s largely constructed from one interpretation of Canadian history—when they’re too young to critically assess it.,It’s surprising the debate has, thus far, been limited to the anthem’s religious connotations when it contains other problematic phrases.,Lines such as “home and native land” conceal Canada’s colonial legacy, which would be more represented by singing “home on native land.”,It’s careless to sing an anthem’s praises before considering what type of image it sends the world about Canada’s national identity."},{"title":"Tighter law a good step","url":"/story/2009-02-05/editorials/tighter-law-good-step/","date":"February 5, 2009","content":"Canada’s new regulation, to come into effect in April, will set limits on who qualifies for citizenship, the Globe and Mail reported Feb. 3.,The new law means children born or adopted outside of Canada to parents who are citizens, but who were also born or adopted outside of Canada, won’t be given automatic citizenship.,Canadians who work outside the country are worried their children could be stateless if they’re born in a country that doesn’t grant citizenship by virtue of birth, such as Kuwait.,The Immigrant Department said stateless children can be sponsored by their Canadian parents as permanent residents. They can apply for Canadian citizenship if they’re under 23 and have lived in Canada for at least three of the four years preceding the application.,The new law is an appropriate measure to prevent people born overseas from obtaining Canadian citizenship, moving back to their home countries and passing citizenship on from generation to generation.,It’s excessive to allow unlimited transfer of citizenship to generations who may have never even been to Canada.,Citizenship in any country is a privilege. Its implication is that, in exchange for contributing to a country in taxes and social service, the state is responsible for protecting and providing for its citizen wherever they are in the world.,But if the law is applied too rigorously, it could overlook the specific circumstances of each case when they should be taken into account individually.,As society moves into a global context, it’s difficult to justify defining rights to citizenship on the basis of birth alone.,This new law shouldn’t limit or discourage Canadians from taking international work opportunities.,Other factors, such as economic and social contributions to Canadian society and residency in Canada, should be considered as well.,Although children of foreign-born Canadians should be required to apply for their citizenship, special consideration should be given to their applications, such as quicker processing.,In order to preserve the value of Canadian citizenship, the state must strike a balance between applying the already-lenient laws too liberally and over-enforcing them."},{"title":"AMS teams let us down","url":"/story/2009-01-26/editorials/ams-teams-let-us-down/","date":"January 26, 2009","content":"The Journal’s editorial board voted to endorse a candidate team.

Team CYZ—comprised of Ceci, vice-president (operations) candidate Leslie Yun and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Adam Zabrodski—ran a more professional-looking campaign than team MAP.,Their Blueprint, outlining CYZ’s campaign promises, is extensive and looks, for the most part, well researched.,The team’s proposal to outsource the AMS’s IT maintenance is laudable and long overdue. The server has been inconsistent for most of the year, costing AMS services in productivity and making it difficult for students to access the main site.,But CYZ’s promise to lobby Kingston Transit for a direct bus route between campus and the VIA Rail and Coach Canada terminals is unrealistic, and the team has greatly overestimated its lobbying power.,It’s surprising team CYZ would make this promise one of its six main commitments, when the transit system is maintained by the city and is beyond the team’s control.,Zabrodski seems to be the most articulate of the six candidates.,His honest approach to answering questions is refreshing and necessary in a role where he would be dealing more with people than with finances.,But Zabrodski fumbled a question on ancillary fees and will have to learn the facts before he can accurately represent Queen’s to other universities’ student unions.,Ceci handles himself well as a presidential candidate. His experience as undergraduate trustee means he’s able to command attention and effectively liaise with powerful figures.,But his smooth talk and extensive use of political jargon make him come off as insincere.,Yun is the weak link in the team. Her medial concentration in economics doesn’t make up for her lack of experience dealing with large budgets.,But Zabrodski’s and Ceci’s experience with Engineering Society and the Board of Trustees, respectively, should be enough to make up for Yun’s shortcomings.,Team MAP—comprised of presidential candidate Colin McLeod, vice-president (operations) candidate Ellen Allwright and Panjwani—is more down-to-earth than team CYZ.,MAP’s platform contains fewer promises and less details. This approach may help the team to be flexible but may also prove inadequate when dealing with the broad scope of activities within the AMS.,The team’s promise to lobby the University for an earlier release date of exam schedules is appreciated.,It’s commendable that, with this promise, the team is looking at cheap ways to improving student service, something they should consider for some of their other ideas.,Although there should be more communication between the AMS and its ratified clubs, MAP’s proposal to create three paid positions to deal with clubs seems redundant when one should suffice.,Allwright is the team’s greatest asset and the strongest of the six candidates.,As the Common Ground’s head manager, she’s responsible for a $1-million budget and a staff of more than 140 people, giving her financial experience and human resources savvy.,McLeod’s honesty is endearing but his surprise at the other team’s opposition research tactics seems naïve.,His genuine approach, though, could win over those put off by Ceci’s smoothness.,Panjwani’s varied extracurricular experiences should help him in dealing with the vice-president (university affairs)’s diverse portfolio.,Some are calling him a hypocrite for condemning ASUS President Jacob Mantle’s Islamophobic comment last term. It’s disappointing they’re criticizing Panjwani for the very behaviour they hope to see in Mantle, that is, learning from his mistake and speaking out against oppression.,In dealing with the issue, CYZ appears to be conniving while MAP comes across as whining; neither image is good and the winning team will have to regain students’ trust in the AMS.,In spite of poor selection, all students should exercise their right to choose their student government by voting today and tomorrow."},{"title":"Athletics needs team effort","url":"/story/2009-02-26/editorials/athletics-needs-team-effort/","date":"February 26, 2009","content":"The Department of Athletics and Recreation is proposing a $120 fee increase to maintain its programs.,The fee, which will be voted on at the AMS Annual General Meeting, would be phased in.

No topic was off-limits and I suddenly found myself being more open and vulnerable with him than I have ever been before.,On his last day in Kingston, I took him out to a student lunch at McDonald’s.

After all, it had only been a month since I had said goodbye to my family at the end of the winter break.,This question was on my mind, even after he left on Sunday afternoon.,I’ve changed since I left my parents’ house and I guess that’s only natural.,What’s also natural is that many people in my hometown still see me in my former light, which no longer reflects the person I have become since arriving at Queen’s.,There’s a definite disconnect between who I was then and who I am now. As a result, I find that if I’m home long enough, I start to revert back to my old way of acting and former world views.,Adam’s visit brought this to my attention.,During my time here, I’ve been exposed to a wide range of people, ideas and opportunities which would not have been available to me in Bolton, Ontario.

That lasted for about a week, until I realized I don’t really have much in the way of investments—it’s my fourth year, and my RESP is drained.,Like many people, my feelings about our society’s voracious consumerism are uneasy at best.

But, to be fair, the outsider team was comprised of three AMS service managers.,Perception did not correspond to reality, making this abnormal win an ebb in the trend’s flow, but not a complete discontinuation from the past five years of election patterns.,So why is it important to acknowledge such trends? It’s not to discount the abilities of less-experienced teams—I’ve often found myself supporting them throughout the years—or to say that branding is the be-all and end-all in AMS elections, although it certainly is a large part of it.,Rather, it’s to illustrate how this trend points to a highly concerning, somewhat expected and generally arbitrary disaffection with, and stigmatization of, the AMS amongst the student body.,I’ve come to the realization that extensive platforms are utterly useless. They’re only read by supporters, inner-AMS folk, those who are viscerally affected by a clause or two and a select few in campus media.,Generally speaking, the majority of students will vote on superficial means: popularity and how anti-AMS a trio can appear.,I, too, have had my days of disregard for campus politics, often telling myself I prefer to be interested in real issues and events. Ambitious students are often mere resume padders—yes, we all know that.,But what’s concerning about this pandemic of apathy is that it isn’t simply isolated, as many may contend, to student politics but is symptomatic of a larger disaffection with any political process that attempts to engage students on this campus.,There has certainly been small cause for celebration when the voter turnout percentage hovered around 45 per cent—a pathetic number, regardless of other universities’ turnout, particularly when one considers the insular nature of Queen’s campus life—but what of the years when it has fallen to a quarter of the student body?,Apathy is apathy and its prominent presence among students won’t simply disappear after convocation."},{"title":"Winning read(er)s","url":"/story/2009-01-23/editorials/winning-readers/","date":"January 23, 2009","content":"I know most of us don’t have time to read for pleasure. Maybe you fit some reading in over the holidays or gave books as gifts. I, however, surged through numerous novels to the tune of my fellow English majors singing whistle while you work. With a stack of five books waiting for me, I considered which to read first. The thinnest one. Start off smoothly? The thickest one. Might as well plunge headfirst. But, the longer I deliberated and studied the book jackets, the more I wondered how influential prize winning stickers are when deciding which book to pick up. Whether you’re looking for an Oprah’s Book Club blessing or an insightful forward from Hemingway, why not buy Canadian?,Thanks to a mysterious and generous donation, the English graduating class received a copy of Joseph Boyden’s 2008 Giller Prize winning book, Through Black Spruce. The prestigious Canadian award may not be immediately recognized by everyone; perhaps this even applies to other awards, such as the Booker or Pulitzer. But, just because you can’t add “Obama” as a suffix or prefix, doesn’t mean literature isn’t news. The Giller Prize, founded in 1994 in honour of the literary journalist Doris Giller, provides accolades for the best Canadian fiction each year. Created by her husband, Jack Rabinovitch, the award is Canada’s largest financial compensation for fiction. Boyden’s critically-acclaimed book traces the lines of contemporary Aboriginal Canadian life and fills in the history of northern Ontario and contemporary multiculturalism. Boyden draws attention to the representation of native voices in North America. The acknowledgement of the continued internalization of colonial oppression somehow made me proud to be Canadian.,Let me explain. The fact that the Giller Prize can recognize the limitations of multiculturalism in Canada and bestow an award in recognition that art and literature can make Canada a more diverse place is honest and refreshing. Although Canada isn’t perfect, we can be proud of the literature that’s produced. Book awards are a beneficial way of determining what title to read, but for every book that’s published, there were a thousand that weren’t, and their perspectives are just as meaningful to the Canadian experience. Aboriginal literature is often marginalized from the mainstream, which demonstrates Boyden’s ability to capture northern Ontario native culture while integrating it into the capitalist landscapes of Toronto, Montreal and New York City. Boyden worked within the system to give a group of contemporary Aboriginals a voice that is often unaccounted for in the canon of Canadian literature. I am, by no means, essentializing the experiences of native groups, but commending Boyden and the Giller Prize for commemorating Through Black Spruce in a way that is meaningful to Canada.,Literary awards serve two purposes: to recognize the achievements of writers and stamp a sticker on the covers of novels to make them more widely read. When you pick up a Giller Prize-winning book, you know it’s of the highest quality and relevance to Canadians."},{"title":"Don’t go on offensive","url":"/story/2009-01-26/editorials/dont-go-offensive/","date":"January 26, 2009","content":"I have to say, even before coming to Queen’s, I was never afraid of contention.,In high school, I was considered the overly-passionate and outspoken individual who always had an opinion about something, even the topics no one ever bothered to talk about.

All because of a single comment he or she may or may not have made without realizing it was an error.,Throughout my life I’ve heard nice people say things they don’t even consider to be wrong or offensive.,A friend of mine back home would often say, “That’s so gay” every time he thought something was stupid or unfair. It bothered me not only because it was wrong, but because he identified as gay himself. No matter what I said, he kept telling me it didn’t bother him that people used the word out of context.,What he didn’t realize was that it bothers other people. Especially me.,I know I’ve probably said a few things that have offended other people in the past but this is where the idea of self-growth and development rears its prominent head. If you don’t take responsibility for the language you use, then you’re telling me that you’re not aware of the history and context behind it.,But that doesn’t make you hopeless.,I don’t condone or condemn ignorant or thoughtless comments, but what I do condemn is the immediate dismissal of the people who make them.,A single ignorant statement could cost someone everything. What we need to ask ourselves is: can we really call their entire character into question?,What has been going on these past few months isn’t something I’m remotely impressed by. I don’t think that, in light of these issues, any tangible solution has been offered.,A lot of people are hurt. A lot of people are offended. But being angry isn’t the way to go about it.,When I hear racially-charged, sexist or homophobic remarks, my immediate reaction is not to attack or blame those who make them. I want to educate them. I want to ask them why they use the language they use and how, together, we can better ourselves in the process.,It may sound corny to you.

I didn’t think of privilege or multiculturalism then, but I remember feeling scared of these bigger, stronger men.,That’s not to say there’s no value in being aware of the implications of our language.,There are reasons I choose to use terms such as “white privilege;” they give me a way of expressing myself when I struggle to translate my anger, sadness and fear into words. On the other hand, I think “celebrating diversity” is a joke if we haven’t first stopped oppression.,But I’m not interested in words because I don’t want to sidetrack from the issue.,There are people who mistakenly believe that, if they can argue that a term such as racism doesn’t exist, its meaning also disappears—but a rose by any other name would prick as deeply. Those people substitute anti-racist efforts with a largely superfluous debate that creates division.,It’s disappointing that the people on campus brave enough to use the word “racism” tend to be those who suffer it the most, those who are constantly forced to prove the authenticity of their experiences.,I can understand our reluctance to acknowledge racism because it implies the need for anti-racism work, much of which involves a change in attitudes more than in behaviour.,It’s quite easy to modify actions on a personal or institutional level: endorse an anti-hate campaign, change your Facebook privacy level or introduce an international menu in the cafeteria. But these actions are reactions that superficially smooth over the problem without addressing it.,Attitudes require more commitment to change because they involve personal responsibility. If you change attitudes, proactive actions follow.,We might begin receiving Campus Security alerts when Muslim women are harassed on campus, for example. I don’t understand why we need to ask to be informed; in neoliberal terms, e-mail alerts are cheaper to implement than halal food options and would probably have a higher return in gratitude from the target group.,We might rename courses from POLS250 (Political Theory) to “Western Political Theory” so I no longer expect to learn about Confucius, Gandhi or Fanon when what I will get is Plato, Hobbes and Locke.,On a larger scale, we might finally have a building named after our most important benefactor, Robert Sutherland.,These relatively small measures have big implications about inclusivity at Queen’s.,There; I’ve used my 500 words.,You can use yours to respond to me in a letter to the editor or a website comment, or you can use them to speak out against racism.

He developed several notable public feuds with colleagues over the years, including such luminaries as Rick Telander and Roger Ebert. He never missed a chance to stir things up with coaches, players and owners on the Chicago sports scene, making himself an integral part of the very stories he was supposed to be covering objectively.,Many of his columns seem to have been written in a controversial way to try and stir up a reaction. He then transferred that sensationalistic approach into regular appearances on ESPN’s Around The Horn, a show focusing on having sportswriters yell at each other over meaningless topics and compete to see who can be the most outrageous.,Mariotti famously left the Sun-Times in the middle of the Beijing Olympics last summer and began firing off acerbic rants about the paper, his colleagues and the imminent death of the newspaper industry.,His departure pleased so many readers that the paper started running ads featuring former subscribers who returned after hearing of Mariotti’s exit. One Internet commentator described him as “the personification of petulance, pettiness, and preening self-regard rolled up in one little beady-eyed, gaseous cluster of mediocrity, with a lump of shit where his heart should have been.”,Despite all this, Mariotti managed to find high-paying work writing a column for AOL Sports and continues his regular appearances on Around The Horn. He continues not only to survive, but thrive.,In doing so, he sends a message to a generation of aspiring writers and broadcasters that the way to the top is to stab your colleagues in the back, pick public fights with sporting figures and exaggerate your opinions to draw a reaction.,Our society is largely based on the idea of trying to climb to the top, and the Mariotti method provides one way to get there. But it doesn’t have to be that way.,Exaggerating your opinions and writing over-the-top rants will probably get you some attention but, to me at least, it’s not worth it in the end. The Mariotti world is painted only in black and white, but shades of grey are there for those who choose to explore them.,Delving into the subtleties doesn’t bring instant fame and notoriety, but it often produces better writing and informed stances you can feel good about.,Moreover, you don’t have to be the most famous columnist in the world to have an impact. I’d rather write something I’m proud of for a limited audience. To me, that’s better than making a Faustian bargain with writing techniques I despise to gain fame and fortune while bringing little to no insight to my readers.,There’s an old Squad Five-O lyric that sums this up perfectly: “I don’t want to change the world, I just want to change your mind.” There’s value in being true to yourself, even if it doesn’t take you to the top."},{"title":"B.C. has stake in Olympics","url":"/story/2009-01-16/editorials/bc-has-stake-olympics/","date":"January 16, 2009","content":"Vancouver city council is asking the province for permission to borrow up to $458 million to finish building the Olympic Village, CBC News reported Monday.,The British Columbia government would amend Vancouver’s charter to give the city emergency borrowing authority; usually, the city must have voter approval in a plebiscite in order to borrow large sums.,The Olympic Village, budgeted to cost $875 million, is being built by Millennium Development Corporation.,Last Friday, Millennium lost its $875 million loan agreement with Fortress Investment Group after receiving only $317 million from Fortress. Vancouver loaned the project $100 million but, because the city signed a completion guarantee agreement, it’s responsible for raising an additional $458 million to finish the Olympic Village.,Premier Gordon Campbell said the province will do all it can to help the city, but Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Monday the federal government won’t step in.,It’s surprising that repeated examples of Olympic cities building up massive debt before the Games—notably Montreal, which only finished paying off its debt 30 years after hosting the Games in 1976—weren’t enough to convince Vancouver of the need for better planning.,Although the staggering budget shortfall is largely the city’s fault, it’s unfair to make the poeple of Vancouver shoulder all of the costs.

Brown should perhaps be asked why she used practice test questions on graded evaluations.,In a small school where a good rapport between students and their instructors can make for a better learning experience, it’s important for the school not to jump to conclusions and automatically side with instructors in conflicts.,Regardless of whether the department follows up on academic misconduct charges, it’s unfair to equate a resourceful group of students, who legitimately accessed test questions on their course website, with students who cheat on evaluations.,Information on the course website should have been monitored by the instructor and those responsible for maintaining the WebCT program; students, who can’t post items on WebCT aside from discussion board comments, can’t be blamed for what appeared on the NURS 403 website.,It’s irresponsible of the departments not to create their own policy governing WebCT use as it becomes more popular.,The University should require all departments to have set guidelines on the appropriate use of WebCT, or any other course website, and procedures for dealing with Internet-related issues.,By their actions, the students have shown they take the course—and their performance in it—seriously; now the School of Nursing needs to do the same."},{"title":"ESS separation puzzling","url":"/story/2009-01-09/editorials/ess-separation-puzzling/","date":"January 9, 2009","content":"This month Education Students’ Society (ESS) members will vote on whether to leave the AMS and join the Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS).,The ESS council passed a motion during a closed meeting Nov. 19 for a referendum on the issue, although ESS President Amanda Leonard said the council will remain neutral.,Leonard said education students, who may be off campus for months during a practicum, don’t have the same concerns as other undergraduate students.,Previous ESS presidents have supported joining the SGPS, she said.,It’s disappointing the ESS isn’t prepared to take an official stance on the issue or explain why it’s bringing the question up now.,Leonard doesn’t adequately explain what education students’ interests are or how they would be better served by the SGPS than the AMS.,It seems unfair to make education students who complete their practicum outside of Kingston pay the same fees as students who stay on campus and have access to all of the resources their fees cover.,But if education students are interested in cutting their fees, the AMS’s health and dental plan, one of the priciest fees, costs significantly less than equivalent SGPS coverage.,AMS President Talia Radcliffe said the AMS could reduce other fees to save education students over $100. The ESS should be focused on working with the AMS to improve its constituents’ positions rather than simply threatening to jump ship.,If the AMS and the ESS are going to renegotiate student fees, it’s important for both societies to consider the impact of lost revenue on the services and the other undergraduate students paying those fees.,The AMS would also have to decide how to deal with education students who remain on campus.,These issues must be carefully discussed and explained before the ESS rushes into a referendum, leaving voters uninformed or confused. By simply pushing the issue, the ESS has forfeited its claim of neutrality.,The council’s flimsy reason that the vote is simply to follow through with a recommendation made by previous presidents reeks of a political cover-up of an ulterior motive or, if it’s true, just plain ineptitude."},{"title":"Honour Sutherland legacy","url":"/story/2009-01-23/editorials/honour-sutherland-legacy/","date":"January 23, 2009","content":"Queen’s Board of Trustees deferred to the principal a proposal to name a building on campus after alumnus and benefactor Robert Sutherland, the Globe and Mail reported Jan. 19.,The Board said former Queen’s principal David Smith still doesn’t have a campus building named after him, adding that the University could lose an opportunity to sell naming rights for a campus building.,Williams will make a recommendation to the Board in March.,Sutherland made history in 1852 by becoming the first black man to graduate from a university in British North America.,But what he should more be remembered for is his bequest that saved the University from having to merge with the University of Toronto because of a lack of funds.,It’s frustrating that the Board continues to stall its decision without proper explanation of its intentions.,The proposal calls for the Policy Studies building to be named after Sutherland, which seems appropriate given his career as a lawyer.,It’s also unlikely the building, which is already 12 years old and not undergoing major renovations, will attract new naming donors, rendering the Board’s reasoning flat and illogical.,Ideally, the Queen’s Centre should be named after Sutherland.,The project is set to become a central hub on campus and it’s even more fitting for the University’s most significant benefactor to be recognized by all students rather than a minority of students who use the Policy Studies building.,Even if Queen’s is forced to sell the naming rights of the Queen’s Centre to raise funds for the over-budget project, the University should suggest the purchaser consider naming it after Sutherland.,The University has an opportunity to name its first building after a person of colour, a step in correcting its historical marginalization of their experiences.,Alumni from minority communities might be encouraged to donate to the University if they see their history finally being acknowledged.,Although Sutherland’s colour shouldn’t be a reason to honour him, it’s likely the reason he has yet to be recognized properly for his contributions—a shameful admission Principal Williams and the Board must work quickly to change."},{"title":"Homecoming going awry","url":"/story/2008-11-21/editorials/homecoming-going-awry/","date":"November 21, 2008","content":"Homecoming weekend will be cancelled and replaced with a Spring Reunion for at least the next two years, Principal Tom Williams announced earlier this week. Next year’s event, originally planned for Sept. 25 to 27, will now be held May 22 to 24.,Williams said the decision is a response to safety concerns raised about the unsanctioned Aberdeen Street party that occurs on Homecoming weekend each year. He said another factor was maintaining the University’s national reputation, which has suffered since a group of students flipped a car on Aberdeen Street during Homecoming weekend in 2005.,It’s disappointing that the University’s taking such a drastic action that punishes the innocent parties involved without solving the problem.,Alumni who are celebrating milestone reunions in the next two years will miss out on one of Queen’s strongest traditions. Although festivities will be moved to a spring reunion, some of the most important elements, such as the football game, will be lost.,Moving Homecoming to a weekend in May when most students won’t be in Kingston destroys the student-alumni interaction that’s integral to Homecoming festivities.,Students who chose Queen’s for its school spirit and traditions will now lose the opportunity to participate in them.,Homecoming is a good opportunity to reconnect alumni to their alma mater and encourage them to donate to the University and Queen’s could end up losing a lot of donations with the date change.,If students want to party, they’ll find an excuse to invite their out-of-town friends over for a weekend with or without Homecoming. With social networking sites it’s possible students could co-ordinate a big party on Aberdeen Street anytime during the year.,The University appears to be stepping away from, not stepping up to, the issue. It seems Queen’s wants to distance itself from the unsanctioned party so it can’t be held responsible for anything that goes wrong.,Williams said the University considered other options, such as moving the event to a later date in fall term or to winter term, when the cold might discourage students from partying on Aberdeen. Other groups have suggested having a sanctioned street party.,It’s disappointing that the University didn’t give more serious consideration to these workable ideas and chose instead to destroy a positive and beloved tradition.,Preventing alumni from coming home won’t make the problem go away."},{"title":"Digest your education","url":"/story/2009-01-19/editorials/digest-your-education/","date":"January 19, 2009","content":"Reflecting on the fall term, I realize that my university experience has involved considerable hours of chewing and barely any swallowing. Perhaps this is my fault. Perhaps this is life. Perhaps this can change.,I’m intrigued by Mark Twain’s statement, “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” Schooling doesn’t promise an education; it provides the bagel but isn’t responsible for the digestion. Indeed, I have chewed numerous varieties of bagels at Queen’s. However, while I’ve had time to think, I haven’t always had the time to reflect. There’s a distinction to be made between the two.,Thinking allows one to upgrade from a B to an A+. Reflecting demands a whole new level of insight and perception. For this reason, I have difficulty picturing John Milton writing the first stanza of Paradise Lost during a one-hour break between a religious studies lecture and a history seminar.,In September, I received comprehensive syllabi, each containing a list of readings and midterm dates. These are standard university procedures.,But are they the necessary standards for creating an environment of stimulating questions, bubbling think tanks, inquisitive minds, world-renowned scholars and the future masters of academia? Does the cultivation of the human intellect truly rely upon hours of reading, writing numerous essays, grappling with sleep deprivation and feeling nauseous after back-to-back final exams? I hope not.,Then again, brilliance often involves sacrifice. Winston Churchill, for instance, is said to have slept an average of less than four hours per day. While my own lack of sleep is certainly not as critical as that of a significant World War II leader, maybe I have a lesson to learn from him about establishing priorities. But I’m still perplexed by the modern-day university system. Although subtly stated, it appears as though quantity is gradually replacing quality. In the undergraduate world, it’s often preferred to have a general idea of the key concepts of a field of study, rather than a thorough understanding of anything in particular.,Is a 45-minute tutorial honestly enough time to fully discuss Plato’s The Republic?,And the expectations don’t end with an academic transcript. Involvement in extracurricular activities and clubs is also crucial. Athletics, volunteering and work experience are requirements to an impressive résumé. After all, experience is vital to the shaping of one’s character.,Don’t misunderstand me. I recognize that professors devote countless hours to their research and universities can’t guarantee that all students become certified genii.,But I’m still not satisfied.,Something’s missing.,While I believe that universities allow for academic freedom, there’s still a lack of imaginative space. What’s the solution?,My apologies; I have to sprint to my 9:30 a.m. lecture. Perhaps it will provide answers while I guzzle down my partly-toasted bagel slathered with already-expired cream cheese."},{"title":"Divesting from ethics","url":"/story/2009-01-16/editorials/divesting-ethics/","date":"January 16, 2009","content":"In March 2008, one year after students successfully convinced the University to divest from PetroChina and China Petroleum, companies complicit in the ongoing genocide in Darfur, the administration told the Journal it would bring a draft statement on ethical investing to the May 2008 Board of Trustees meeting. May came and went, however, without the appearance of any such draft.,At the time I was a bit miffed at the delay, but accepted that it takes time to craft an ethical investing policy. Perhaps everyone in the operations and finance office was huddled in then-Vice-Principal Andrew Simpson’s office, arguing whether Anscombe’s consequentialism could be reconciled with Kant’s categorical imperative when it came to investing.,I hoped that when they did get around to releasing the draft, it would consist of a framework of socially responsible policies outlining our duty to society rather than simply reiterate our unshakable fiduciary responsibility to our stakeholders. Perhaps it would even include a plan for the systematic screening of investments and the creation of a permanent Board of Trustees committee with the responsibility of monitoring and reviewing our investments to ensure they continue to meet our ethical standards.,Needless to say, when the draft was finally released four months late, it was a bit of a letdown. Instead of ethics, it appeared everyone in the operations and finance office had been debating how to release an ethical investing statement without actually committing to anything. What they gave us was a glorified complaints procedure with the word “ethical” replaced by the more ambiguous term “responsible.” There was no mention of our duty to consider environmental, societal and governance issues in relation to our investments.,After the draft’s release, the administration extended a perfunctory request for feedback and said the final statement would be voted on in December. Not surprisingly, December came and went without any statement. The final draft is now scheduled to be voted on in March, almost a year after the first draft was supposed to be presented.,So how could a university that had just divested from companies doing business with the Sudanese government turn its back on ethical investing practices only a year later? The answer is that the Darfur divestment had nothing to do with ethics and everything to do with placating students. As Vice-Principal Simpson told the Journal last March, “We had conversations with the fund managers on how they felt. They were not relying on those investments.” The message is loud and clear: As long as you ask us to divest from companies that don’t make us lots of money, we’re happy to support ethical investment.,Now that Simpson has left, however, there may be reason for hope. It could be that Principal Williams was disillusioned with the statement and wants to make amends. I guess we’ll find out when the final draft is released sometime in 2010."},{"title":"Something’s gotta give","url":"/story/2008-11-21/editorials/somethings-gotta-give/","date":"November 21, 2008","content":"This week, Queen’s was featured on the front page of multiple national newspapers.,But were these media outlets praising research successes of our professors or lauding our ranking as one of Canada’s top universities? Sadly not.,This wasn’t a shining moment of PR for our institution, but rather a public airing of our dirty laundry, as the administration’s two controversial moves—the cancellation of Homecoming weekend and the introduction of discourse facilitators in residence—were put to the judgement of the nation.,And the nation wasn’t pleased.,In response to the Homecoming cancellation, an Alumnus commenter on the Journal’s website is forthcoming: “Thankfully I chose to leave Kingston and go to a university that will look good on my resume for graduate studies. ... The university has been taken over by a bunch of spoiled, suburban, American Eagle clad sociopaths.”,This depiction of Queen’s students is not only unflattering but also largely untrue—this commenter obviously isn’t aware of the flashy new Urban Outfitters us sociopaths are frequenting these days—creating a stereotyped image that others will pick up on and accept as the norm.  I have problems with the so-called “conversation police” and agree with the Journal’s editorial regarding the Homecoming cancellation, but I’m not worried about being jumped in the JDUC for using a politically incorrect word or how I’ll be able to assemble 8,000 people on one street using only Facebook and my wits; I’m most worried about what message this kind of publicity sends to alumni, prospective Queen’s students and (more importantly for me) prospective employers or graduate schools.,Though I don’t agree with what has been done, I agree with the feeling behind the action.,Yes, we’ve heard it all before—the thoughtless actions of a few are ruining it for many. But they’re really starting to ruin it. As people start to look upon Queen’s as a school of spoiled, drunken bigots, my own pride in attending this institution has started to falter.,I have come to realize that although I was not directly contributing to the problem, I was allowing the idea that it was a few bad apples ruining things to stop me from doing anything directly to help the Queen’s community turn its problems—and its reputation—around.,Whether we like it or not, our school is being presented in a certain way. While the problems I’ve outlined above are very real, I don’t believe it’s these problems that should define how Queen’s graduates are seen by the rest of Canada and the world.,Queen’s is currently dealing with a long list of problems. Let’s not add “digging our reputation out of the gutter” to that list.,The students I have encountered during my time at Queen’s are so much more capable, intelligent and caring than they’re currently being given credit for.,When it comes to preserving our reputation and helping ensure the future of Queen’s, student apathy has the power to be much more dangerous than a flipped car."},{"title":"Here’s to posterity","url":"/story/2008-11-27/editorials/heres-posterity/","date":"November 27, 2008","content":"There’s a bookshelf at the Journal house that stores decades’ worth of previous volumes of this newspaper in bound copies.

This makes our responsibility to get the facts—and get them right—all the more vital.,I completely understand that people are busy or want privacy. But it’s my job to get the story and, though it may be a cliché, people have a right to know what’s really going on behind the ivy-covered walls of the school they pay thousands of dollars for the privilege of attending.,So when senior administrators don’t return our many phone calls or their assistants tell me, “He doesn’t have time to talk to you; just make up some quotes and run them by me,” it just makes me more determined to keep trying.,It isn’t always easy being the bearer of bad news, and there has been a lot of bad news lately. But I believe I can best give back to the University I love by reporting honestly and objectively about what goes on here.,People may not always be happy with campus media, but imagine a campus without one.

To be honest, it’s simply very entertaining to play with my BlackBerry.,When I’m not texting ardently or on the phone, I’m browsing the Internet, using BlackBerry messenger or taking a photo. Normally I’m also listening to music.,I’m not trying to brag about the versatile capabilities of my BlackBerry (even though it’s truly amazing), but instead I’m trying to illustrate the addictive nature of BlackBerries.,I may sound like I suffer from CrackBerry-ism, but I consider myself a responsible user of technology.

It also means that when people see me they think I’m either stressed, rude or too busy to care (I hope I’m none of these things).,A few days ago, my love for my precious BlackBerry was shaken to the core by a disconcerting incident that changed the way I interact with it. I was walking home while simultaneously texting my housemate, because there was something of no real importance I decided I had to tell her although I was only two minutes from my front doorway.,My eyes were locked on the screen and I had removed my gloves to facilitate speedy texting.

I had it shielded in my hands, so although my hands were left scratched and bleeding, my BlackBerry remained undamaged. My knees are still bruised, and my jeans are tattered, but of course the main injury was to my pride.,I write this editorial as a warning: Although BlackBerries are amazing, fantastic and make life easier, please remember it isn’t necessary to be on them all the time.,If I can’t convince you of this, look up at least once in a while from staring intently at one of its astounding features.

Braille invented the raised-dot code that bears his name, enabling the blind to read with their fingers. Braille’s bicentennial is an important milestone for the 12,000 Canadians who use the code in their daily lives.,As new technologies emerge, it becomes easier for some to dismiss Braille as an outdated code. With audiobooks and podcasts, many say Braille is less a necessity and more an option for the blind. Why go through the effort of feeling each letter when you can simply sit and listen?,But, beneath the dots, Braille holds important significance as a language that unites the world.,As the global standard of communication for the blind, Braille is used across continents and cultures; geographically speaking, it’s the most widely read language.,Braille trumps technological inventions in practical terms too. In the case of a power outage or computer glitch, it doesn’t pay to be completely reliant on a machine to direct our verbal lives—we want to have important information at our fingertips.,If we believe technology will phase out Braille, we may as well agree the written word itself is going out of style—but this just doesn’t seem likely. If the crowds of holiday shoppers were any indication, bookstores are still very much on the consumer’s radar.,The written word holds its own in an economic slump, too. When exotic travels start to be considered luxuries we can pass up, books remain a relatively cheap way to find hours of entertainment. Escaping to Hogwarts or Lilliput creates a good mental refuge from visions of the credit crunch dancing through our heads.,We should celebrate Braille’s bicentennial, then, as more than just a passing date of interest to those who understand the code. This milestone for Braille should serve as a reminder of the magic of written language.,However technology may advance, the written word still fills a special niche. Louis Braille was onto something: There’s a good, old-fashioned charm to print and paper. Curling up with a data chip just doesn’t have the same effect as sitting down with a favourite book.,It seems unlikely Braille will go extinct anytime soon. So let’s use its 200-year milestone to make a wish for the next few hundred years of Braille.,In spite of a growing focus on accessibility, a vast majority of books remain in formats the blind can’t read. Working to change this reality seems like a logical place to start and we can applaud Canada for being a leader in this regard.,On Jan. 16, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind will launch a new Canadian Braille textbook, the country’s first in 50 years. Although it’s surprising this took half a century to happen, it’s an admirable way for our country to toast Braille’s bicentennial."},{"title":"Xbox only partly to blame","url":"/story/2008-10-28/editorials/xbox-only-partly-blame/","date":"October 28, 2008","content":"Police are investigating a possible connection between Xbox and 15-year-old Brandon Crisp’s disappearance from his home two weeks ago, CBC News reported Oct. 25.,The teenager left his family home on Oct. 13 after an argument in which his parents took away his Xbox video game console.,Crisp’s parents said they were worried he was becoming addicted to the game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and have taken away his gaming privileges before following similar arguments.,Microsoft, which manufactures Xbox, has offered a $50,000 reward for anyone with information that leads to Crisp’s whereabouts.,Steve Crisp, Brandon’s father, said he’s worried one of the people his son has been playing online games with may have lured him from home.,But it’s unfair to blame Xbox directly for Crisp’s behaviour. The company simply manufactures the products; it’s up to consumers to be responsible in using them.,The offer of a reward, however, is a good marketing strategy.

Many are arguing that Clinton was treated unfairly due to her gender, but that no one bothered to say anything until Palin was the victim of the same sexism.,As far as I’m concerned, neither side is correct.,For Clinton supporters to suggest that she received harder questions because she was a woman or was subject to greater media scrutiny on the basis of her gender is to suggest that she shouldn’t have to answer these questions or deal with the public’s perception of her simply because she is a woman.,If Joe Biden had been given a particularly difficult question during the debate, would he have claimed to be the victim of misandry? When journalists comment on John McCain’s creepy old-man aesthetic, is that sexism? The jobs of the president and vice-president are to answer difficult questions from Americans and occasionally to deal with unnecessary criticism.,Clinton’s self-confessed attempts to masculinize her image—the ubiquitous pantsuits, the short hair and turning down an offer to appear on the cover of Vogue because the magazine attempted to put her in a skirt—problematically imply that she believes competence and power are embodied in the male.,Sarah Palin’s pageant queen poses and ditzy persona create a picture of a woman in politics as Vice-President Barbie: pretty but hollow.,Elizabeth May recently made headlines when she represented the Green Party in its first ever inclusion in the televised party leaders’ debate. May conducted herself with fearlessness and dignity, holding her own amidst the more established parties and impressing many Canadians.

So dull that visions of bookish Liberal leaders fishing in all-too-obviously staged photo-ops muffled my nightmares, the tone-deaf voices of Australian and Canadian prime ministers singing in unison whispered in my ear and the bland tastes of an NDP kitchen table, ripe with populism and cliché, sat flavourless in my mouth.,Meanwhile, arguably the most exciting and important American election in decades has taken hold of this country too. We shamelessly watched the vice-presidential debate over our national debate, we wear Obama t-shirts, and Tina Fey has garnered a bigger Canadian audience in one month than Rick Mercer has seen in his whole career.,Perhaps this, coupled with myriad other systemic apathetic tendencies, is partly to blame for our country’s internationally disgraceful voter turn-out on Tuesday.,So is the American system better? Should our politics be less elitist and more populist, thereby fostering grassroots engagement? The American system, they say, is more democratic; anyone can be President—just look at Sarah Palin.,In the United States, our political leaders, even Jack Layton, would likely be chastised as snobs, bores and physically unappealing individuals. And dull, overwhelmingly dull.,But is it unreasonable to ask that elections in the most powerful country in the world be more than a tribal council on steroids? Where good work ethic, some nice stubble and an appeal to “Joe” in all of his conceivable manifestations don’t warrant stumbling near to victory without intellectual qualifications?,We have a system that, although perhaps conducive to apathy due to frequent and lacklustre campaigns, ensures that only politically sound, well-educated and experienced individuals can climb to the top of their parties. But elitist as it may be, it’s also practical.,It acknowledges and accepts that the next prime minister must confront issues like the political polarization of Alberta and Quebec, an ongoing war in Afghanistan, climate change, economic recession, renewed relations with an emergent China, poor immigration institutions, our role in ineffective international institutions, weak infrastructure in cities, ethnic conflicts worldwide—the list goes on.,Extraordinarily powerful positions require extraordinary minds. Competence, sadly, may occasionally be forced into association with elitism simply by virtue of its strong emphasis on elite qualifications. This is not to excuse a lack of charisma or connection with our beloved Joe—in this regard, Barack Obama is to be envied—but to justify its absence as a more preferable deficiency than the lack of a convincingly well-educated mind vying for leadership in the United States.,Give me policy writers before pageant queens, professors before actors, businesspeople before body-builders.

But what I found most disturbing is how Kingston seems to derive so much of its identity from a fort that didn’t really do much and yet, in the same stroke, is willing to undermine its fragile attempt to hold onto that past with hokey, expensive Halloween decorations.,Although the amuse-o-matic nature of “Fort Fright” is tacky and jarring, it’s just a practical—in terms of incoming cash—extension of the Haunted Walk’s kitsch. I think it’s also symptomatic of Kingston’s not-exactly-riveting but still sordid relationship with Fort Henry and its past.,It feels as though we rely on former glory as Canada’s first capital far too much and only focus on aspects that are convenient and marketable.,Admittedly, the fort is situated in a beautiful location and can perhaps shed some light onto Eastern Ontario’s history. I noticed a plaque dedicated to the Ukrainian men who were interned at this site in the years following World War I; at least the haunted experience was educational on some level.,I think it’s important to look back, by not just glossing over but acknowledging the more uncomfortable, shady sides of history—not including ridiculous, moving skeletons smeared with fake blood.,In the wake of uncertain funding for the arts, we need to support the stories and culture current residents are trying to cultivate."},{"title":"It’s easy being green","url":"/story/2008-10-21/editorials/its-easy-being-green/","date":"October 21, 2008","content":"The third annual Arctic Report Card was released last week, the Globe and Mail reported, combining climate change research from 46 scientists in 10 countries.

It eerily resembles failed attempts to curb youth violence in the United States, which emphasizes long jail terms.,At 14, a person hasn’t developed full comprehension of the significance of his or her actions.

The life sentence is usually handed down with parole eligibility after 25 years. It’s unlikely someone incarcerated at 14 would spend the rest of his or her days behind bars; society has to deal with the reality that the offender will be released by middle age and it’s imperative that he or she learn within the prison system how to live outside of it.,Young offenders also need their identities protected from the public so that, when released, they can live without stigmatization.,Right now, the Tories’ unwillingness to give young offenders a second chance is almost a crime in itself."},{"title":"Downes up to the occasion","url":"/story/2008-10-14/editorials/downes-occasion/","date":"October 14, 2008","content":"Kingston residents cast their votes today to choose their representative for Kingston and the Islands riding in Parliament.,Incumbent Liberal MP Peter Milliken is running for his sixth term in office, against Conservative candidate Brian Abrams, NDP candidate Rick Downes and Green Party candidate Eric Walton.,NDP candidate Downes is a breath of fresh air for a community that’s starting to go stale from 20 years of Liberal dominance.,Downes has been an active Kingstonian since 1979, serving three terms as a city councillor and two as a school trustee.,He ran unsuccessfully in the 2006 mayoral and 2007 provincial elections, but his political exposure has given him the opportunity to meet many residents and find out what’s important to them.,Downes should be applauded for his dedication to Kingston; in three elections he has stayed true to his message of working for the common good.

What it comes down to is that they do the best they can.,But apparently it’s not enough.,When I was in first year, I saw the AMS as something like an “Ivory Tower” where the students who were paving the way for tomorrow made sure that everyone’s needs were being met. In reality, I had no clue what they did. In second year, I became avidly involved and gained a better understanding of what goes on.,Many of my friends put down the AMS because they feel that it’s nothing more than “power-hungry nerds.” And, for the record, they really aren’t.,The AMS is made up of a broad range of individuals who come to the table with an array of ideas of how to make the University a better place. They do a lot to make our transition from high school to university easier.,At the same time, there’s obviously a lot more that can be done—and it isn’t being done.,When I first learned that private T4 forms were stolen from the AMS, my gut reaction happened in typical AMS fashion: blame the culprit.

Now, you may be asking yourself, what is it that separates film photography from digital, what makes them wholly different from one another?,The answer to this lies in the method of recording itself. Considering that, at the most fundamental level, photography is the translation of light into an image, film and digital represent different modes of translation.,In film, slides made of light-sensitive chemicals are inserted into a camera in order to record light. Light travels onto the slide and “burns” an image by physically altering the very atoms of the chemicals which are contained within it.,In this way, film photography represents the physical recording of an image by simply harnessing the light-sensitive properties of certain chemicals. The mode of recording is produced prior to the photograph, and exists independently from the method itself.,Digital photography is a whole other matter.,Like film, light is translated into an image, but instead of altering the structure of chemicals, light is translated into electronic signals and processed by an image sensor. These electronic signals are then interpreted by a built-in program that produces an image only when further processed by an imaging program.,In this way, digital photography represents imagery that is created by the subjective interpretation of light by humans.,The translation of light into image is produced within the confines of human interpretation, and thus is malleable. This is both a freeing and dangerous aspect of digital photography.,In the case of film photography, the image is dictated by all of the variables before the photograph is taken.,In digital photography, the image is dictated by all of the variables after the photograph is taken.,The implications are thus: we must understand that digital imagery is subjective and, therefore, dictated by the individual—or individuals—who produces that image.,Take a more critical eye at what you’re looking at—is this a record of reality, or one’s own interpretation of it?"},{"title":"The unfortunate realities","url":"/story/2008-10-02/editorials/unfortunate-realities/","date":"October 2, 2008","content":"Life’s unfair; this is an indisputable fact.,As an immigrant, or the child of an immigrant, you’ll often find yourself being identified as a visible minority.

We must accept the fact that, while most people are tolerant, there’s a minority of the population who do not recognize our right to be “Here”—and this happens almost everywhere in the world.,It’s distasteful, but we visible minorities need to grow thicker skin and pick our battles. A dirty look on the street is not deserving of the term “racism,” as it cheapens the meaning and weight of the word.,A racist comment, while hurtful, is unfortunately a reality of living as a visible minority and can and should be ignored. Racist people are looking for a reaction by making such comments; don’t give them that pleasure.,Telling racist people such comments are inappropriate will go over their heads; clearly they’re not the most sensitive or accepting people in the world.,When a felony is committed, as we just saw happen to the QUMSA club space, that’s when the police should get involved.

I don’t believe that a coloured person has less right to the sidewalk than a white person.,I just don’t think it’s helpful to anyone to act as if we’re in a society of complete tolerance and understanding, because we aren’t.

It has reached a point where racism’s commonly looked down upon, and humour can be found in it (read: Peters, Russell).,But by sweating the small stuff, such as verbal harassment and dirty looks, we’re cheapening our own cause and allowing racist people the pleasure of seeing us get upset.

Instead, the executive refused to take responsibility for its error and redirected the blame to the person who took the documents.,This attitude destroys students’ faith in the institution’s ability to protect their private information and highlights the need for policy changes to improve students’ security.,It’s too simplistic to fault Bell, a long-time permanent AMS staffer, for a genuine error in an otherwise clean career. Bell said he reported that he couldn’t get into the storage room and, because someone else was made aware of the situation, there should have been more accountability in ensuring the documents reached their proper destination.,Perhaps the AMS should also introduce more security measures, such as having two people to move the forms and making sure the storage space is accessible on the day they’re moved.,Changes in policy and practice would let the hundreds of AMS employees know the AMS is taking the issue seriously; in the absence of a formal apology though, that remains unclear.,If only the AMS kept employee forms as secretive as it does its accountability practices.

The committee’s plan is to phase out the unsanctioned street party by 2009.,Judging from the long lines at the LCBO all week and the number of students from other universities who are planning a trip to Kingston, it’s unrealistic to hope the party will fizzle out by next year if an alternative event isn’t introduced.,There have been talks of having a concert or turning Homecoming into a family carnival, but both ideas miss the point of Aberdeen entirely. An alternative event’s only hope of drawing students away from Aberdeen is to continue to give them what they want—the chance to drink and socialize with fellow students and alumni—in a safer, more contained venue.,It would be impossible to eliminate house parties entirely, but the next step should be to create a sanctioned party to downplay Aberdeen Street’s effect.,A street party isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Berlin has closed city blocks for New Year’s Eve every year since 1995 and each year more than a million people party safely and happily long into the night.,The University might have to consider closing parts of University Avenue on campus to host a street party for Homecoming weekend, with admission limited to Queen’s students and alumni.,The party would have to be licensed, and students would probably be required to show proof of age to purchase alcohol.,It’s disappointing that, with all of its talk, the working group hasn’t tried anything like this yet.,If the University and Kingston are willing to put their efforts behind a sanctioned celebration, the rest is up to students, both past and present, to make it work.,It’s up to Queen’s students to stop inviting irresponsible out-of-towners to Kingston and to ensure any guests we do bring party respectfully.

A few things about the party don’t change from year to year—the fraternal affection of the male-dominated crowd, piles of broken glass and Johnson Street lined with police officers.,My jaded mood aside, there were others who were clearly not enjoying themselves. I spotted a few lone wanderers, their cell phones in hand, trying to contact their friends, sour faces that had been pushed one too many times and the drinkers who had gone too hard too early.,I also suspect the ratio of visitors to Queen’s students increased; I heard, “Is this Aberdeen?” on the street more times this year than any other.,The results of the ASUS survey have yet to be seen, but I suspect that not only are more of the partiers from outside the Queen’s community than in previous years, but fewer Queen’s students are participating in the street party.,I noticed a difference in enthusiasm among the participants and heard frequent exclamations of, “I’m sick of this!” and “Why did we even come here?” from passers-by.,It appears the anticipation and excitement surrounding the event is diminished by the fact that it’s little more than a street filled with screaming, drunken people. And as the night went on—and I began to realize that once you have taken one photo of the crowd you have taken them all—I certainly agreed.,Perhaps students forget the reason why we have a Homecoming weekend and why there’s an alumni parade during the football game.

A partygoer asked in a raised voice, “Are you an alumnus?”,“Yes,” he replied.,“That’s awesome; party on!” the student screamed, with a raised arm, and continued on as the alumnus turned back to stare at the street.,Not the camaraderie you would expect from some members of a university so bound in tradition.,It’s unreasonable to expect the street party to ever go away, as an archival search showed it has been a prevalent story in this newspaper for decades.,But it’s reasonable for it to become a little less angry, aggressive and destructive while becoming more welcoming."},{"title":"Bus outside the bubble","url":"/story/2008-09-23/editorials/bus-outside-bubble/","date":"September 23, 2008","content":"On the bus, there’s always someone who will sit down and proceed to tell you his or her life story, even if you’re just riding for five minutes.,Yes, they tend to be a bit strange, but after you step off the bus you might realize that you’re, even just slightly, interested in the complicated quantum physics the chatty grad student was trying to explain, or the incredibly specific details of the elderly person’s latest shopping adventure.,There’s always the sick guy, armed with a bundle of used Kleenex, with the painful and hacking cough he doesn’t even bother to cover his mouth for.

Two East Asian women were taunted with “sucky sucky five dolla” chants by a group of drunken young men, a student took down his pants and peed against the Journal’s house, my reporting partner was repeatedly called a “douche” by several women for diligently taking notes on a criminal incident and I had my hair pulled by an angry passerby who mistakenly believed I had “an issue.” This year, a woman used pepper spray for no reason and injured about a dozen bystanders, one of whom suffered an asthma attack.,What surprised me most, however, was that both police and Red Hat volunteers appeared to expect no better of the night, telling the Journal it was nicer than previous years’ parties—complete disillusionment.,By virtue of our basic moral awareness, we should not be stuck with this problem at all.,We shouldn’t be university students who throw glass bottles onto the street, expecting someone else to clean up the shards. We shouldn’t shout discriminatory howls insulting people’s gender or ethnicity; even when drunk, there’s no excuse.,We shouldn’t be piggy-backing visitors who intend to treat our homes and streets like trash cans every Homecoming.

That is, school spirit is a term that refers to someone’s support of the educational institution, one that exemplifies student investment into the school.

Slums where Jews were forced to live under the Nazi regime were called ghettos and, more recently, the term has been applied to inner-city neighbourhoods in cities such as Toronto.,The AMS should be applauded for choosing a more neutral term to replace a potentially offensive one.,Most of the houses in the student Ghetto don’t merit such a harsh description, but most of them couldn’t accurately be described as part of a village—which suggests a clean, ordered space—either.,It’s unlikely an institutional name change will be reflected in the vernacular and most students probably still refer to the area as the Ghetto. Although Tye might say some of the homes average half a million dollars, a lot of them look like they would cost that much to repair.,The neighbourhood could arguably be characterized as having ghetto-like qualities if the term refers to an area inhabited by a specific population; the city seems to have created a double standard where students are at the lower end of Kingston residents. Some students living outside the area’s widening boundaries have reported better recycling collection and snow removal by the city.,In the Ghetto, students’ recycling is often dumped onto their front lawns when it hasn’t been properly sorted, and sidewalks aren’t ploughed in the winter. In a village, both of these issues, among others, would need addressing.,Some landlords haven’t enforced even basic safety and housing standards on their properties.,In that light, the name change could have a positive effect on the city and could prompt landlords to treat Queen’s students like regular residents and improve their living conditions.,But calling the area a village can only do so much to create a positive image of the neighbourhood; the rest must be made up of students’ efforts to keep their lawns clean, pick up broken bottles and treat their neighbours with respect.,Actions speak louder than words and the AMS must treat the name change as merely a first step in improving student housing."},{"title":"Online safety questioned","url":"/story/2008-09-16/editorials/online-safety-questioned/","date":"September 16, 2008","content":"Strangers are increasingly able to discover people’s personal details from public websites, the Globe and Mail reported Sept. 12.,Globe staffer Matt Hartley searched profiles of strangers on Facebook and pieced together their lives using only public websites such as Canada411.com and MySpace.,Hartley’s investigation raises the question of how carefully people should guard their information on the Internet.,Many people who opt to allow “Only Friends” to view their information on Facebook think they have taken the necessary steps to protect themselves.,But websites, such as 123people.com, that carry an inventory of people’s names with information on each person gathered from public websites have started to spring up across the web.,Though sites such as Facebook carry some responsibility for keeping users’ information out of the public domain, each individual is ultimately responsible for managing his or her own information.,The government might also find it difficult to create rigorous privacy laws surrounding Internet use such as those in China, as they could easily toe the line between being protective measures and censorship.,There are now sites that search a person’s online profile to clean it up and more and more parents are asking for this service for their university-aged children.

Obama, a Christian, personally called the two women to apologize on Thursday.,It was a smart political move from all sides: voters for whom a candidate’s religious affiliation is important are once again reassured of Obama’s Christian identity and people who were worried he was casting Islam as a negative belief are now mollified by his apology.,It’s easy to dismiss this as a one-time occurrence but the actions point to the much deeper problem of image-conscious American politics. It’s disturbing his campaign had to make the move at all.,This isn’t the first time in this election candidates have been called out for things unrelated to their campaign issues. The media, many times the instigator of is-he-or-isn’t-he speculation, was quick to point out three Obama supporters wore Abercrombie & Fitch shirts when standing onscreen behind him at a rally in Indiana April 23. There was talk he was trying to attract the uppermiddle class vote, the gay vote, or whatever stereotype the clothing brand is associated with, until the men confirmed the obvious on CNN—they just like wearing A&F.,It’s no surprise candidates feel forced to play the superficial image game in order to reach the top. Real issues take a backseat to candidates’ “electability,” political jargon for which candidate can come across as the most patriotic, all-American. Unfortunately for Obama, this means being wary of visible minorities and resistance to change.,He faces a unique challenge because, as a black candidate, he has to toe the line between representing the change he promises and maintaining the status quo to attract traditional voters. Judging from the recent issue, he seems to have adopted the latter tone, preferring to change the system only after he has secured his victory.,Although it was a good move in a campaign where perceptions overshadow facts, Obama has opened up a can of worms on how far he should play the game and when it will be safe for him to start acting on his words of change.,He won this battle, but Obama needs to seriously consider where his priorities lie before he begins to lose the respect of voters."},{"title":"No golden lining for Gaels","url":"/story/2008-09-09/editorials/no-golden-lining-for-gaels/","date":"September 9, 2008","content":"Queen’s Athletics teams have dropped their ‘golden’ designation and become simply the Queen’s Gaels, Athletics and Recreation Director Leslie Dal Cin said in a Journal interview Sept. 5.

For now, the name change appears in marketing initiatives and on the athletes’ new gold uniforms.,Although Dal Cin’s efforts in improving athletics seem sincere, it’s worrisome that the department is getting caught up in consumer mania. With jargon like ‘marketability’ and ‘rebranding’ popping up, it appears the University is interested in selling an image at the expense of tradition.,The name ‘Golden Gaels’ carries a rich legacy of success that current athletes are pushed to live up to.,Dal Cin said playing up the school’s name creates a stronger connection between athletes and the rest of the University. But putting the University’s name into a sports team won’t make non-athletes feel any closer to their athletic counterparts if they’re already feeling distant. The money spent on updating publicity and uniforms with the change should have been spent on finding ways to reach a home fan base.,Former athletes might feel alienated from a name they didn’t compete under as well.,Equally simplistic is the department’s argument that dropping the descriptor in front of ‘Gaels’ clarifies the word’s meaning. The appearance of the word ‘golden’ is unlikely to affect how many people can connect gaels with Scottish warriors.,The department’s other argument for using simply ‘Gaels’—that the name emphasizes Queen’s Scottish heritage—is also puzzling. It would seem that, in an institution where students come from many different backgrounds, the University would want to avoid such narrow and exclusive terms. It would be better, instead, to build unity among students and athletes through a shared sports legacy.,If rebranding is the goal, it would seem that keeping a descriptor that’s in line with sports’ highest standard would be preferable.,For a department intent on consumer appeal, Dal Cin and the Gaels seem hopelessly out of touch with their market."},{"title":"Inequality out of Vogue","url":"/story/2008-09-05/editorials/inequality-out-of-vogue/","date":"September 5, 2008","content":"A 16-page spread in the August edition of Vogue India—which includes a photo of a toothless woman carrying a baby wearing a Fendi bib—has garnered criticism for its portrayal of the poor wearing designer items, the New York Times reported Aug. 31.,Vogue India Editor Priya Tanna defended the spread, saying it was meant to show “anyone can carry [fashion] off.” Tanna’s defense is naïve at best.

The most popular of these experiences include the random guy or girl you partied with the night before whose name you’ve since forgotten, the friend you’ve been meaning to make plans with, the former floormate you never hung out with, the classmate you only talk shop with and the “potential” you’d like to get to know (a lot) better.,If it’s someone you wish not to associate with, who insists on forming a one-way friendship, it might be time to politely make up an excuse to exit the conversation before it goes beyond just talking about school and the weather.,The “bump in” is a social phenomenon to be embraced.

With excitement that could only have been induced by altitude, I found a voice-activated replica of R2-D2 for only $169.95! Also tempting was “The Marshmallow Shooter”—a mere $24.95 for what would surely be hours of fun, complete with “pinpoint accuracy.” But upon further perusal, I decided that “The Hollywood Cookie Diet” most definitely takes the cake. Four boxes for $59.99 and cookie dieters can (atypically) lose five pounds in just three days?,After rediscovering my dog-eared copy of SkyMall the other night, I decided to tune into some late-night television. Before long I came across what can arguably be deemed superior to the in-flight magazine: the infomercial.,“With Turbo Jam, I lost 97 pounds,” a beaming woman in Spandex told me. “It’s a party in your living room, I’m tellin’ ya!”,Burning fat and calories at a rate of up to 1,000 calories an hour? It’s fast, fun and effective? What better preamble to a box of miracle cookies?,On a search for more miracles, I clicked on the advertisement for “The Rihanna Diet” that confronts me every time I go online. To wit, Rihanna’s solution comes in the form of a product called “Ultra Lean Green Energy Tea.” A testimonial on the website says, “I am addicted to Ultra Lean Green.” Now, doesn’t that sound healthy?,As the school year picks up and, for many students, time devoted to physical activity goes down, phrases like “freshman 15” and consequent miracle cures are everywhere. An article in Wednesday’s Globe and Mail cited a study which found that female students at the University of Guelph actually gained an average of only 5.3 pounds in first year. The blame was placed not on late-night poutine and all-you-can-eat ice cream, but on lack of exercise.,In the past couple of years, media reports have zeroed in on rising obesity rates in North America. While miracle solutions abound, most experts probably agree diet cookies won’t help. The Globe’s proposed cure for the freshman 5.3 doesn’t fall into the miracle category; in fact, it’s fairly obvious: eat healthy food, control portions, snack wisely, stay active and get some sleep.,Last year my housemate made spinach brownies from a cookbook containing recipes that sneak healthy ingredients into not-so-healthy food. Vulgar taste and sponge-like texture aside, it seems unlikely that encouraging children—or housemates—to eat pseudo-brownies will instill in them the same nutritional values as does the dinnertime mantra of yesteryear: “Don’t forget your vegetables.” But while there are obvious issues surrounding the health of many North Americans, maintaining a healthy attitude toward nutrition, as well as body image, is easier said than done.,“Don’t forget your vegetables” might seem like a hackneyed phrase, but when miracle slogans dominate our day-to-day lives, it’s probably a good idea to keep some old school jingles running through our heads.,(Results may vary.)"},{"title":"Don’t have a little faith","url":"/story/2008-09-12/editorials/dont-have-a-little-faith/","date":"September 12, 2008","content":"Next year will mark 200 years since the birth of Charles Darwin and 150 years since the publication of On the Origins of Species.  Biologists have since discovered DNA and mapped the human genome, yet Darwin’s theory of evolution is still under attack. Creationism, or Intelligent Design if you wish to delude yourself, argues that life is too complex to have developed through natural processes, leaving God as the obvious designer.,By studiously analyzing the Old Testament, some religious scholars have deduced that the earth is approximately 6,000 years old, contradicting the widely accepted age of 4.5 billion years. It’s just a small difference of opinion, really. To help spread this gospel, creation museums have opened across North America, claiming to back up their theories with cold, hard science.,As ridiculous as this position is, it’s also easily understood. If you believe the Bible is literally the word of God, it’s a no-brainer that the Earth is 6,000 years old. You have your faith to prove it; what more is there to say?,But I want to consider a more interesting group: those who don’t take their religious texts literally, opting instead to carefully select which pieces they wish to take on faith.  While this position is extremely convenient and non-controversial, it’s entirely a cop-out.  First, a disclaimer: There are many reasons to believe in God. For some it brings meaning and purpose to life; for others it’s a result of deeply spiritual experiences. Whatever your reason, I’m not here to tell you that you’re wrong. I’m only interested in the various interpretations of sacred texts.,If my neighbour sold his daughter into slavery, as permitted in Exodus 21:7, can I condemn such an extreme action or must I obey the teachings of my sacred text? The answer, of course, is that through critical examination, I conclude that a literal translation of the Old (or New) Testament is meaningless. Most people would agree there isn’t enough evidence to believe God would support such a decision.,But this application of reason only gets us into more trouble. If there isn’t enough evidence to believe slavery’s acceptable, what evidence is there for the existence of Adam and Eve or even that Jesus was the son of God?,Whether or not you choose to believe these things has no effect on anyone other than yourself, but you still can’t rationalize it.,Somehow, millions of religious people have found a way to pick and choose which parts of their religious texts to believe. Evolution works alongside Christianity, I’m often told, because God created evolution and that whole universe-in-seven-days thing’s a bit far-fetched. Then they turn around and insist that Jesus worked 47 distinct miracles; after all, it’s right there in the Bible.,Sorry, but you can’t have it both ways. Dismissing one piece of text based on critical analysis and accepting another on faith is hypocritical.  At least the fundamentalists are committed."},{"title":"Uniforms fail ethics grade","url":"/story/2008-09-16/editorials/uniforms-fail-ethics-grade/","date":"September 16, 2008","content":"Queen’s athletes’ new uniforms are no longer made by Russell Athletic, the Journal reported Sept. 12.

You’ve joined the dark side too, and there’s nothing you can do. But for those of you who have managed to preserve your summers the way they were meant to be spent, relish them while you can.

It has been reported that some seats have cost students up to $100.,There’s no conclusive information on whether this is happening at Queen’s.,The actions by McMaster students who are selling their places are completely unethical. They set a bad precedent for Queen’s, where budget cuts and tight enrolment caps prevent some students from taking the courses they want or need.,They also widen the socio-economic divide when not all students can afford to buy their way into courses.,Rising tuition fees have made it impossible, or at least undesirable, for many students to spend an extra year finishing their degrees. The social pressure to pursue graduate studies limits them to courses that fulfill—sometimes perceived—entrance requirements.,Under these conditions it’s no surprise some students feel the need to put up cash for spaces in popular courses, but this devalues their education as well as undermines courses with spaces that students don’t pay extra for.,The University needs to take precautions against such potential actions.,An ideal situation includes having more sections of popular courses and a better teacher-to-student ratio. But if these options aren’t financially viable, the University should at least create waiting lists so students can be automatically enrolled in courses if other students drop them. It’s a logical move that would save students from having to refresh QCARD obsessively for sudden open spaces.,A list would also help students near the bottom decide whether they should begin looking at other courses before those fill up.,It might be necessary to have a human hand maintain the lists to prevent hacking; the administration needs to address this concern before implementing waiting lists, but it shouldn’t be a deterrent to creating them.,The University needs to act before students—albeit likely a minority—begin to cash in on seat selling."},{"title":"Empty bleachers","url":"/story/2008-09-16/editorials/empty-bleachers/","date":"September 16, 2008","content":"It has been a strong year so far for Queen’s interuniversity sports teams. The football team improved to 3-0 on Saturday with a 41-7 demolition of the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks; the men’s rugby team has beaten West Point and the University of Ulster at Coleraine in international exhibition matches and clobbered the University of Toronto 86-3 in their regular-season opener last week. The women’s rugby team and both the men’s and women’s soccer teams have also put up some good results.,However, these teams have a common denominator beyond their success—their lack of support from the student body. There are students who regularly cheer on the teams and they’re both knowledgeable and committed but their numbers are small. Both soccer teams regularly play in front of crowds of 50 to 100 people, many of whom are relatives. Women’s rugby has been drawing similar numbers. The men’s rugby team receives considerable fan support, but there’s still barely any buzz about their success on campus. Even the football team, traditionally one of the biggest draws on campus, has seen poor student support this year. They cracked the top five in the national rankings for the first time since 2003 last week, but you wouldn’t have known it from the 250 or so students who bothered to turn out to see Queen’s beat Laurier for the first time in five years. Overall, 1,455 fewer people attended this game than Laurier’s 23-4 win over Queen’s last year.,Those 250 students were an improvement, though, as they at least stayed for the whole game. At the season-opening football game on Sept. 1, several thousand frosh and their leaders showed up, but the student seats were almost empty by halftime. Running back Mike Giffin told the Journal last week the lack of support shown during the opener was demoralizing for the team. “It’s pretty disappointing as an athlete to have your fans leave halfway through a game,” he said.,It’s not like these games are of poor quality. Queen’s Department of Athletics and Recreation has done a commendable job of improving the game experience and, at football at least, there are countless amenities, including concessions, the VIP Zone where you can buy food and alcohol as well as well-choreographed sideline entertainment from the Queen’s Bands and the competitive cheerleaders. The on-field product is also very impressive; there are more than a hundred players in the CFL who came up through CIS football, OUA rugby has produced players for the Canadian national team and several professional soccer players got their start in the CIS.,These are terrific athletes competing for their schools and they could use a boost from some enthusiastic student fans. Admission to all regular-season games is covered in Queen’s students’ athletics fee, so if you’re a sports fan, there’s no reason to pass up Queen’s games.

It was her first time visiting Toronto, she said, and did I know any places she shouldn’t miss?,We spent almost two hours creating a list.,Another time, I rode the train with someone who turned out to be from Queen’s and in my program.,We ended up eating a meal together as we waited for separate bus connections.,If there’s no other benefit to having a temporary travel companion, I notice it’s at least easier to use the bathroom without having to carry my luggage in with me.,Some bus encounters don’t work out. While waiting in line in Montreal, James introduced himself and proceeded to take a seat diagonally behind mine.,The whole ride was set up for failure; it was the week after the Greyhound murder, I was travelling overnight and a passenger announced to the bus that he had forgotten his medication.,When we stopped for a break in Kingston, James followed me into Tim Horton’s. “You know,” he said, “you do this funny thing with your head when you’re asleep. You kind of roll it to the side.” I hurried into the women’s bathroom and left my housemate a frantic, I’m-leaving-you-all-my-assets phone message.,It’s easy, with an iPod, to become isolated from fellow travellers. But, who knows, a potential friend—or perhaps a good horror story—could be sitting next to you, waiting for an introduction.,I’ve learned to appreciate my encounters, good or bad.

The song choice raises the question of how the Orientation Round Table (ORT) perceives its responsibility to make Orientation more inclusive.,The Gaels have had to sign contracts in recent years promising to keep Frosh Week a dry event, and the traditional beer cheers have been prohibited for the past two years.,Although most frosh are underage when they arrive, many have been exposed to alcohol since high school. A beer cheer’s unlikely to make students start or stop drinking.,It doesn’t make sense for the ORT and SOARB to create policies around alcohol, yet ignore the exclusivity suggested by The Caesars’ explicitly sexual song.,The ORT and SOARB appear unprepared to explain why alcohol issues take precedence over sexuality issues, instead choosing to arbitrarily impose regulations students can’t be expected to understand, much less follow.,The alcohol ban’s ineffectiveness calls into question whether such regulations are necessary at all. Gaels’ contracts are mainly enforced on an honour system and anybody who was in Kingston last weekend could point out many frosh who weren’t sober.,First-year students should be treated as adults, capable of making their own choices rather than being patronized by self-important policies that are out of touch with reality.,The ORT and SOARB don’t appear too concerned with properly implementing their policies, being content to have them in writing to pad the University’s inclusive image to curious outsiders.,Frosh Week would be better geared to students if they were allowed frank discussion on issues of healthy sexuality and alcohol use raised by the Orientation songs and cheers. It might blemish Queen’s attempt at a squeaky-clean image to admit students can be irresponsible about alcohol and sex, but it would teach students how to become safer for the future.,The beer cheer might create the proper momentum to discuss alcohol issues later in the year or, at the very least, frosh performing their song will feel part of a tradition of cheers and the occasional pelvic thrust.,Sometimes it’s necessary to take these instances with tongue firmly planted in cheek."},{"title":"Prioritize academics","url":"/story/2008-02-29/editorials/prioritize-academics/","date":"February 29, 2008","content":"A key point in AMS executive-elect Radcliffe-Wang-St. Clair’s campaign platform was their plan to diversify the academic realm by creating new departments such as Middle Eastern studies, aboriginal studies and African studies.,English professor Rosemary Jolly told the Journal she would love to have an African studies department but doesn’t have the time to devote to it. Jolly said many professors are overcommitted—the time needed to take on such a project isn’t there.,Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane cited lack of funding and space as the main hindrances to expanding departments.,The irony is evident—Principal Karen Hitchcock’s aspiration to “engage the world” will prove an insurmountable challenge if the University locks this much of the world out of the classroom.,Last year a student petition for Arabic-language courses collected 2,005 signatures: almost four times the 525 students who voted in favour of the Queen’s Centre fee. The demand from students is there but the University has failed to muster the funding to satisfy it. As an academic institution, Queen’s has to start making financial decisions that allow it to grow as such.,For more than a decade, the school has suffered from a scarcity of permanent faculty members, and the temporary professors brought in don’t necessarily offer the specialized knowledge a full-time professor would. The lack of job security temporary faculty positions offer can also act as a deterrent when Queen’s is recruiting profs.,Science-related courses are usually targeted for funding because of their equipment imperatives and the global emphasis on these fields. But arts courses are equally in need of continual upgrades whether it’s in the form of new, diversified courses or hiring enough professors to at least avoid cutting courses.,Hitchcock should begin in the classroom. Offering a few token regional-based courses in each department is hardly representative of the world; if academic offerings are limited by faculty, then it’s clear what needs to be done.,It’s a shame professors are so strapped for time and resources that worthy interdisciplinary projects are put on the back-burner.

Her five-year term ends June 30, 2009.,AMS President Kingsley Chak abstained from voting, citing his involvement in the nine-member advisory committee responsible for reviewing Hitchcock’s reappointment.,It’s commendable the AMS took a stance on such an important issue. Their decision to openly state their opposition to Hitchcock’s reappointment demonstrates Assembly’s prepared to potentially sacrifice amicable relations with the University to express its views.,It’s questionable whether the AMS’s chosen course of action was the most constructive option, however. Coming at the tail end of the review submission process, it’s unclear what the effect this motion will have on the review, if any.,The AMS motion lost some of its credibility in the AMS’s failure to consult students before voting. The AMS is meant to be students’ voice, but it’s impossible to tell if this motion represents student opinion.,Hitchcock has refused to comment on anything related to her reappointment. This decision only makes her more detached from student needs and opinions, however.,Hitchcock was similarly silent when she came under scrutiny for allegations of ethical misconduct during her term as principal of the State University of New York at Albany. Her decision to stay mum then—and now—when faced with public dissatisfaction doesn’t exactly instill confidence.,If she hopes to regain Queen’s students’ confidence and repair the obviously fractured relationship with the AMS, she should start by acknowledging that they have spoken at all.,The AMS puts itself in potentially hot water with this public and unequivocal statement of disapproval. It will be interesting to see how this motion affects the relationship of next year’s executive with Hitchcock and the administration.,Also interesting is the SGPS’s response, which has been to distance itself from the motion in an apparent role reversal: the graduate and professional student society has traditionally been more vocal than the AMS.,Although the motion’s long-term effects remain to be seen, the AMS should be lauded for taking a stand."},{"title":"Olympic-sized dissent","url":"/story/2008-03-20/editorials/olympic-sized-dissent/","date":"March 20, 2008","content":"Protests against Chinese rule of Tibet began March 10 and have escalated into violent revolts resulting in the lockdown of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. Violence has since spilled over into neighbouring Chinese provinces and spread on Monday to China’s capital city, Beijing.,Varying reports puts the estimated death toll as high as 80.,The international community has expressed concerns about Beijing playing host to the 2008 Summer Olympics, with the kick-off ceremonies set to begin in a few weeks. China has alleged the Dalai Lama is trying to ruin the global sporting event.,Claims that China’s treatment of Tibet will profoundly affect the upcoming Olympics are unfounded. Turning the event into a political pawn is the wrong way to go about resolving the country’s human rights problems. It wouldn’t take a genius to predict that the Olympic bid wouldn’t erase China’s treatment of its political foes, and if the International Olympic Committee made Beijing the Games’ host with that in mind, they’re sadly deluded. If anything, pressure surrounding the Games has propelled China to crack down further on sources of dissent.,The Olympics have put China and its human rights violations in the spotlight. It’s too bad the global community doesn’t take notice of the complex issues this country faces when there isn’t an impending international sporting event.,Western countries’ muted condemnation has essentially hit China with a slap on the wrist—a blow that won’t have nearly the same effects as trade sanctions would. As significant importers of Chinese goods, the West can effect serious change. But so far, the closest thing to taking action has been negative press coverage, and little at that.,The Dalai Lama plays an integral role in this situation’s outcome, but has expressed frustration with the ongoing violence. On Tuesday, Tibet’s leader threatened to resign if the situation continues to spiral out of control.,Although his vexation is understandable, the last thing Tibet’s people need right now is an unwilling leader.,Chinese President Hu Jintao and the Dalai Lama should both have interests in resolving this issue quickly and with as little violence as possible.

As a last courtesy, it would have been heartening to see her talk openly and candidly about the past four years and the reasoning behind her decision. As the University’s public face she owes that much to her constituents and her lack of communication subsequent to her brief e-mail indicated only indifference.,Hitchcock isn’t the only one at fault here. Prominent members of the Queen’s community refused to comment on her resignation or the committee’s undisclosed recommendation.,Students deserve to know what the committee’s recommendation would have been, and after making such a vocal statement AMS Assembly shouldn’t have clammed up and avoided media coverage.,Hitchcock’s status as Queen’s first female principal at a school accustomed to white, male leadership makes her sudden departure more disappointing. Breaking the old boys’ club barrier is a difficult task, especially when the University perpetuates that atmosphere. In seeking both an interim principal and a full-time successor, the University should focus on fostering a more inclusive and accessible environment to ensure this situation isn’t repeated and allow the next principal a better chance at success.,Queen’s faces numerous infrastructural, academic, cultural and financial challenges in the coming years. We need a principal who’s both capable and open to candid discussion about the University’s position and future.,Many students have indicated it doesn’t make much difference to them whether Hitchcock stays or goes, and that’s indicative of her detachment as principal.,It’s commendable Hitchcock stepped back to listen to what students had to say—it’s too bad it was only when they were asking her to leave."},{"title":"New bill taxes creativity","url":"/story/2008-03-07/editorials/new-bill-taxes-creativity/","date":"March 7, 2008","content":"Stephen Harper’s Conservative government has put forward a bill aiming to monitor the morality of Canada’s television and film industry.

It has the potential to seriously harm the Canadian industry, which is known for pushing the envelope when compared to more regulated American entertainment.,Canadian directors such as David Cronenberg and Atom Egoyan have received attention for their films’ controversial content and would easily satisfy the criteria for “offensive” material. Movies such as Juno—whose lead actors and director were Canadian—and Brokeback Mountain—filmed in Alberta—may never have made it to the big screen.,The criterion of being “contrary to public policy” is a ridiculous threshold that leaves ample space for censorship. Allowing bureaucrats to have the final say in what’s “offensive” is contrary to public policy itself and threatens freedom of expression.,When the Canadian industry attempts to mimic the American blockbuster entertainment style, the projects often end up flopping. Canadian films are able to reach receptive Canadian audiences and make waves internationally because their producers are free to experiment with edgier content—one need only look at this year’s Oscars for examples.,With this bill, the Conservative government gives the thumbs up to generic, watered-down versions of Canadian films and television.

And lucky for him the University has removed the word “interim” from his title, allowing him the full freedom of a long-term appointee despite his relatively short timeline.,Despite the expiry date on his principalship, he’s showing no signs of short-sightedness, having already begun holding meetings to discuss Queen’s Centre debt and announcing his intention to release a plan of action by September.,His commitment to improving the University despite the length of his term as principal also seems to be an indication of his dedication to the University. Having already established himself in the community, he has no need to use the position to build his own reputation and is under little pressure to prove himself.,He has already indicated he won’t be seeking reappointment next year which should allow for a smoother transition to the permanent principal when it’s time for him to gracefully fade from the picture.,This is not a job that leaves any room for delusions of grandeur, and hopefully Williams will be able to maintain the solid head he appears to have firmly planted on his shoulders.,While the situation is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination, Williams is likely in a better position that anyone to help Queen’s start to dig its way out of the pit (pardon the analogy) it has dug itself into.

SGPS President Arash Farzam-Kia said he can’t recall any agreement between the University and the SGPS that states it will contribute financially to the project. Any student fee for the Queen’s Centre would have to pass at a graduate student referendum.,A Queen’s Centre student working group discussed a $30 million student contribution to the project in 2005, divided based on student population: the AMS would contribute $25.5 million, leaving $4.5 million to the SGPS.,The agreement signed by the AMS guaranteeing undergraduates’ $25.5 million included a clause that read the University would use “its best efforts” to ensure the SGPS contribution, but clearly their best efforts aren’t effective. Vice-Principal (Operations and Finances) Andrew Simpson said the University’s still hoping for a financial contribution from the SGPS.,The University’s plight in this financial bungle is laughable—almost three years have passed since the initial $30 million figure was decided on and no one seems to have followed up since.,There’s still a line in the Queen’s Centre budget for a $4.5 million SGPS contribution—a clear example of the financial mismanagement plaguing the project. The disconnected lines of communication between Queen’s and the SGPS, coupled with the more than $60 million of debt the University’s set to rack up, don’t bode well even if a fee makes it to referendum. If the SGPS now decides to withhold a contribution, it would hardly be shocking.,It’s unfortunate graduate and professional students feel detached from the University, and if they don’t want to contribute, that’s up to them.,The SGPS should make a decision whether to contribute to the Queen’s Centre. An official consensus among graduate and professional students needs to be reached, and the University needs to adjust its budget accordingly.,The University needs to pull up its socks and take a serious look at the Queen’s Centre budget.

Bush’s speeches. NBC replied to the accusation by explaining that the speech, in its untouched entirety, was available on its website and was scheduled to be broadcast on sister station MSNBC.,This policy of “setting the record straight,” is essentially the administration’s attempt to control how the media represents the White House.,But what the United States—and every country for that matter—needs is news sources that aren’t criticize, be it the average person or the president. In addition to reporting on events, the press needs the freedom to interpret those events within the context in which they happened.,That’s not to say the media shouldn’t be held accountable. On the contrary, the Bush administration has every right to call out reporters on factual errors and comments taken out of context. As a media source, we expect nothing less of our readers.,But it’s ridiculous for the White House to set the record straight after every disparaging, Democratic remark. The role of the opposition is to keep the government in check, and by definition, it’s unlikely to agree with everything a Republican government does or says.,This behaviour is childish and immature and makes the Bush administration look like nothing more than a petulant child.,The president should be focusing on more important issues —such as how to proceed in his last few months in office.,Besides, access to information is different than freedom to interpret it, which is what’s at stake when there’s a policy like “setting the record straight.”,Maybe if the Bush administration wasn’t so busy drafting e-mails, its members would have more time to focus on saying what they mean in the first place.

But Canadian Taser use has risen dramatically and the country’s still reeling from the death of Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski, who died after being Tasered in Vancouver International Airport last October.,Those added factors make this secrecy alarming and farcically frustrating.,The reluctance of public bodies—be they national police forces, a university administration or a student government—to disclose information is astounding,The University refuses to release its corporate sources of research funding or any information about animal research.,Queen’s signed a fixed-term contract for Queen’s Centre construction in December because everything was coming in over bid, but said in January all the project’s finances were a-OK.

It’s ludicrous for them to view access to information as a privilege.,In addition to leaving people completely in the dark, failing to release that information suggests these bodies have something to hide.

Milosevic’s repression and ethnic cleansing of Albanians led to the 1999 Kosovo War, when NATO entered the war declaring its mission to remove Yugoslav troops and deploy peacekeepers to allow for Kosovar refugees to return.,Twenty-nine world states have recognized Kosovo’s formal autonomy since its parliament declared independence Feb. 17. On Tuesday, Japan and Canada became the last of the G7 countries to join the list.,Canada’s reluctance to recognize Kosovo seemed to stem form its concern over setting a precedent. Some analysts have drawn parallels between Kosovo’s quest for independence and Quebec’s, suggesting Canada might open the door to Quebec separatism by acknowledging Kosovo’s independence.,Comparing Kosovo and Quebec is naïve and illogical. Quebeckers live arguably freely and enjoy the benefits of federalism. The government’s month-long dawdling was unjustified—Bernier seemed to acknowledge this when announcing Canada’s recognition, carefully calling Kosovo a “unique case.”,Taking a month to make this statement is ridiculous and makes Canada look incompetent. The delayed response suggests the federal government actually sees Quebec as a less radical Kosovo—a twisted and hopefully untrue notion.,Canada initially defended its failure to recognize Kosovo with the contentious nature of such a stance with its allies and with Canada’s Serbian population. But Bernier made no mention of these factors, indicating nothing has changed since Canada’s hesitation except the government’s realization that continued refusal to recognize Kosovo would make it a pariah on the world stage.,If Canada should get any credit for this, it should be for finally stepping up to the plate. A month later, and after umpteen debates on the dangers posed for Quebec separatism, the government has said what was obvious at the time of Kosovo’s initial declaration. Canada’s tardy statement stands in stark contrast to other countries’ swift responses and makes the government look foolish and clueless."},{"title":"Time for last call, QTS","url":"/story/2008-03-28/editorials/time-last-call-qts/","date":"March 28, 2008","content":"Every year, Queen’s Telefundraising Services (QTS) calls thousands of Queen’s alumni, eliciting donations that go primarily towards services such as libraries, athletics and scholarships. QTS has a database of about 80,000 alumni and is aiming to raise $700,000 for the Annual Fund this year, which goes towards University operations.,The service employs Queen’s students, who work with a script and aim to establish a rapport with alumni. Conversations are often steered towards alumni’s past extracurricular activities and involvements at Queen’s as the student records the information in the database. The information is used to create custom call lists for telefundraisers who may have similar experiences.,If the University wants its alumni to donate, it needs to establish a connection involving more than a phone call asking for money. The only relationship some former Queen’s students maintain with their alma mater is through continual solicitation of funds. Homecoming and similar events help, but the University should do more to keep in touch with students who spent several years here, not to mention thousands of dollars.,A database used to record alumni interests could do more than help specialize fundraising tactics. Sending alumni updates on sports teams or clubs would do more to engage alumni than a telefundraiser’s anecdote about how he or she almost went to a Queen’s football game but decided it was too far.,QTS’s approach is nothing short of relentless—calling parents with children still at Queen’s is overkill and needs to stop. It’s equally useless to call recent graduates, many of whom are more worried about paying off debt than increasing it through donations.,The best way for Queen’s to raise money from alumni is to create an experience that will makes students want to give back when they leave. If students reflect fondly on their years at the University, they will be inclined to return the favour. But if all they remember is how much they were paying, they won’t feel inclined to whip out their wallet.,Gifts and pledges count for five to six per cent of the University’s annual operating budget—a number Vice-Principal (Advancement) David Mitchell hopes to increase to 10 per cent in the next few years. If the University’s serious about upping its donations, it’s time to stop updating their database and start updating their approach."},{"title":"Lovelace ruling unjust","url":"/story/2008-02-29/editorials/lovelace-ruling-unjust/","date":"February 29, 2008","content":"Justice Douglas Cunningham sentenced Queen’s professor Bob Lovelace to six months in prison in a Feb. 15 ruling, instructing him to pay a $25,000 fine after finding him guilty of contempt of court. The charges stem from Lovelace’s failure to obey a court injunction ordering him to cease protesting Frontenac Ventures’ uranium exploration. The proposed site, near Sharbot Lake, is claimed by the Ardoch Algonquin First Nation.,Lovelace is a former chief of the Ardoch Algonquin.,Lovelace’s lawyer has said they will appeal the court decision.,Lovelace has said he feels torn between Canadian law and Algonquin law and it’s unfortunate that his conviction to both has now landed him behind bars. Protracted land disputes between the federal and provincial government and aboriginal peoples are nothing new; this poorly handled situation is yet another blemish on that track record.,Cunningham’s guilty of serious overkill in his judgment. Although Lovelace did refuse to obey the injunction, both the land’s ownership and the laws governing its use remain contested between the Ardoch Algonquin and the Ontario government. This issue isn’t nearly as cut and dry as Cunningham seems to think.,His decision to then hand Lovelace the harshest possible sentence for his crime was an unwarranted attempt to set a legal precedent. Cunningham’s sentence is hasty and unjust and seems to be motivated by a desire to teach Lovelace and other would-be protestors a lesson through intimidation.,This situation indicates a skewed system—Lovelace’s contempt of court charge doesn’t touch the issue of uranium exploration and aboriginal landclaims at the heart of the dispute.,Queen’s stance on this is commendable—Principal Karen Hitchcock has expressed her support for Lovelace’s freedom of expression in a statement on the University’s website and Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane said Lovelace will have his job waiting when he’s able to return. Good on Queen’s for not leaving Lovelace high and dry.,If anything good comes of this legal mess, it’s the publicity it has garnered for the Ardoch Algonquin’s cause. Uranium drilling is environmentally devastating. The judiciary’s attempt to silence these protests, and the government’s failure to act, does little to help a toxic situation."},{"title":"Non-athlete of the week","url":"/story/2008-03-14/editorials/non-athlete-week/","date":"March 14, 2008","content":"For those who aren’t well-versed in obscure holidays, today is International Ask a Question Day. It’s also Pi Day, National Potato Chip Day and, celebrated “in the crevices of your black soul,” Emo Day. So many reasons to rejoice! In recognition of the art of curiosity, I have a question: does Toronto have a CFL team?,In fact, I have a number of questions along those lines: what’s an offside? How many people are on a rowing team? My knowledge of sports is remarkably lacking. I have to confess that despite my passion for newspapers, I’ve never read a sports article outside of the Journal. Not once.,My ignorance of the sporting world outside Queen’s, though, is entirely my fault, but it’s an overstatement to say I’m devoid of all athletic enthusiasm and experience.,My athletic career began at age nine, when my dad forced me to join a soccer league. When that failed—to me, playing defence meant “it’s time to sit down and make bracelets out of dandelions”—I started playing tee-ball. There, in the outfield, my parents’ superstar daughter was at it again with the dandelion jewelry. My baseball profession ended when my team, named after our Whopper-lovin’ sponsor, was rechristened “Booger King” by our opponents. I like to think I was opposed to the inter-team animosity, but it was probably just the heinous blue pants that made me quit.,Other attempts at athleticism over the years included figure skating, gymnastic lessons and various summer camps: horseback riding, tennis and worst of all, golf.,One summer, overwhelmed by the game’s intensity, I fainted on the seventh hole of a golf course. At a meet years later, I fell off the track halfway through the 800-metre race. That winter, I was the kid who dropped my poles from the chairlift on a school ski trip.,At this point, my dad began to realize he didn’t have an incredibly athletic daughter. While my brother was winning provincial cross-country championships, I was reading books in the stands.,I used to argue about whether the one physical activity I really loved could be labelled as a sport. My dad did his best to pretend that he liked my dance recitals, but the older I got, the better he became at arriving at the last possible minute—and when I think of how many dances were structured around Britney Spears remixes, I don’t blame him. Still, I continue to maintain that dancers are athletes—just look in the Journal’s sports section today.,Last week, my dad and I were talking about what Journal positions I’m applying for next year. He suggested I expand my journalistic horizons.,“You should apply to be a sports editor,” he said. I could feel this year’s sports section and those of years past cringing from afar.Maybe, by writing about sports, I’ll finally be able to reach for my dad’s athletic stars, I thought.,But it’s probably best if I just go to a game or two to support those who actually do have talent and perseverance in the athletic realm.,In any case, this signed editorial just shot my chance of getting the job."},{"title":"A modest proposal","url":"/story/2008-02-29/editorials/modest-proposal/","date":"February 29, 2008","content":"I remember in high school when, too tired to go to class, I would show up two minutes before the period was over with an I-missed-my-bus excuse. The teacher never believed me—perhaps unsurprisingly seeing as I’m from Toronto, where ‘missing a bus’ on most routes adds about five minutes to the travelling time.,It was a shock when I discovered one fine Sunday morning that missing a bus in Kingston actually means an hour-long wait and a missed church service. Standing naïvely in the cold, I didn’t find this out until later, of course, because the bus stops don’t post service times.,Twenty minutes into the wait, my frozen toes led me back to my house, where I decided to contact Kingston Transit requesting a few changes. I recognize that Kingston isn’t Toronto and my fantasy of 10-minute wait times isn’t feasible, but there are cheap, easy fixes that would greatly improve the service.,The website, for starters, is entirely unhelpful. There’s a map with coloured lines indicating all of the routes, but no information about where the stops are along the way. Route schedules list such hints as “Downtown—6:30 a.m.” without clarifying the exact locations.,I e-mailed the city with two simple requests, asking them to list the addresses of every stop on the schedule and include dots on the map for each bus stop along a route. My reply from Kingston Transit said: “We have taken your suggestions forward for consideration and appreciate the time you took to write in with them.” That was four months ago and today the website still hasn’t changed.,This inaction confuses me. In the time it took for Kingston Transit to reply to my e-mail, someone could have typed in an intersection below the “Downtown” heading on the bus schedule.,The city seems to have issues with meeting its residents’ needs and updating itself, insisting that because things have traditionally been done a certain way, they can continue on that path. Kingston seems to forget most students aren’t from the city and are unfamiliar with how it operates; they need help on adjusting to the place they will call home for at least four years.,This attitude can be seen in bigger issues such as snow removal. I have yet to see a snowplough in the Ghetto. When I phoned the city’s bylaws office, I was reassured there’s a bylaw that requires people to clear the snow by their houses, but I don’t see anybody enforcing this. Kingston isn’t trying too hard to overcome the insider/outsider relationship it fosters with Queen’s students.,Last week the city unveiled its $46-million K-Rock Centre, an entertainment and sports arena downtown (wherever that may be). If the city can afford this, saying it can’t afford to update the transit website or enforce a snow removal bylaw is really a ‘k-rock’ of shit.,Maybe it’s time for us to let them know. Maybe it’s time for us to e-mail or call, and make the mandatory $42.25 student fee we each pay every year for bus service count for something."},{"title":"All across the universe","url":"/story/2008-04-03/editorials/all-across-universe/","date":"April 3, 2008","content":"It’s the end of my second year of university, and I’m having an existential crisis. Okay, so I’m not exactly Simone de Beauvoir.,All right, I’m nothing like Simone de Beauvoir. Still, something hasn’t been sitting right lately. I’m restless, withdrawn and can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing out on something.,I may still have two more sheltered years of university left before branching out into the real world, but I might as well be up a creek without an undergraduate degree, because I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. Dramatics aside, I’ve been consumed by an end-of-year anxiety that can only be described as one thing: wanderlust.,Perhaps you’re not familiar with the German loanword that roughly translates into the desire to travel. Let me explain.,I was raised in Scarborough, a suburb of Toronto where strip malls blossom abundantly and Mike Myers Way is somewhat revered as a landmark. Growing up in what I thought was the centre of the universe, my 10-year-old self never wanted to leave the GTA. “Why would I?” I would tell my parents, teachers, and friends smugly. “Toronto has everything.” Content to do nothing more than ride the subway, shop at the Eaton Centre, go to the ROM and enjoy the familiarity of my hometown, I figured I would never want to leave Toronto.,I was wrong.,My wanderlust affliction started last year when three of my friends spent the summer teaching English in Italy. Grounded with a nine-to-five bank job and living at home, an exciting day for me meant filing credit card fraud investigation forms (in alphabetical order, of course) and driving down the street to Tim Horton’s for lunch. I missed my friends terribly, and was envious of their European adventure. Suddenly, I wasn’t so keen on being confined to the limits of the GTA. And so began my existential crisis. What else was out there? More importantly, what had I been missing out on my whole life? I decided it was time to get out, but that was easier said than done.,Between my new obsession with scouring the Air Canada website for tickets to Turin, emotional e-mails to my Italy-bound friends promising I would come to visit, and teary fights with my parents that usually involved yelling the phrase “I’ve never been anywhere! I’m so domestic,” my desire to flee the confines of my suburban stomping-ground became stronger than ever. I never made it to Italy that summer, but remembering the restless days of that hot July has had me compulsively planning out for the last eight months all the places I want to visit.,So, where will I be this summer? Well, the plane ticket I booked yesterday to go to Europe should be a good start to indulging my wanderlust and shaking off my existential crisis. Between chasing cows in the English countryside and pounding the pavement in the familiarity of Kingston, for the first time in my life I feel like I’ll be expanding my horizons, exploring new cultures and various other travel clichés this editorial doesn’t have room for.

A time capsule to open in the year 2000 or when I graduated from high school or something, a memento of times past, a purpose-fuelled inspiration to motivate myself at 12 to dream big, and at 18 to pursue those dreams. The capitalist’s dream summed up in a Dr. Phil moment of self exploration, facilitated by a small-town schoolteacher whose favourite phrase was, “The sky’s the limit.” I found one of them the other day, a record from my last year before high school, tucked between the pages of a pink diary guarded by the words “keep out” written in menacingly sparkling purple nail polish.,In the letter, I had written myself about who my best friends were, (using the classic initial-only last name unique to public school days: “Ashley H.”), my favourite bands—The Beatles, Oasis, Tom Petty—and what I wanted for the future: “To become a famous author, and also a doctor (maybe).”,While I’m pretty impressed by my pre-teen enthusiasm for music that’s still dear to my heart, I’ve given up on a dream I no longer remember having to be a doctor.,The whole exercise, though more than 10 years in the making, was fairly anti-climactic. Far from mourning the loss of failed dreams, of being inspired by the purer hope I had once had, I was mostly creeped out by the letter’s eery and narcissitic address—”Dear Meghan,”—and signature: “Love, Meghan.” The letter did, however, make me think about the tragedy of the one-way passage of time—how much better it would be if I could write a letter and pop it into some time-travelling post system that would take it back to the days of dollar-store eyeliner and “group dates.” I would write to myself about the things that really matter—that diary I kept, the books I was reading, the music I was clinging to, family, friends who were good at being friends—and the things that don’t: Grade 9 math class, boys who make fun of curly hair, bra size. Again there would be a distinctly Dr. Phil-like vibe to the whole thing: “hindsight’s 20/20.” Now I’m in my fourth year of university, on the edge of something even bigger than high school appeared back then, and I don’t feel half as secure as I did then. There’s no road map from here on out, and I’m not really keen on drawing one just yet. ,Dear Future Self, The sky’s the limit.,Love, Meghan"},{"title":"Digging the hole deeper","url":"/story/2008-03-07/editorials/digging-hole-deeper/","date":"March 7, 2008","content":"When the University unveiled plans for the Queen’s Centre in 2004, it budgeted $230 million for its construction.

If most of the overrun is due to rising construction costs, could the University not have tried to account for that in its initial budgeting?,The prospect of Queen’s cutting corners on the project to recoup costs is also worrisome: the outcome of this financial mismanagement could result in a Queen’s Centre missing the components that made it worth building in the first place.,Although the University’s signing a fixed-cost contract with PCL Construction Management, there’s little doubt that the cost overrun will continue to mount.,It’s also unclear how Queen’s will escape this financial dilemma: the project was budgeted to be $60 million in debt and surpassing that can’t be a good thing.,Simpson said they’re lobbying the government for more money but he isn’t optimistic about that project’s success. According to the Queen’s Centre website, $16.5 million in funding is coming from “government grants and other funding.” It’s ironic and discouraging the University’s dedicating its lobbying efforts to convincing the government the Queen’s Centre’s worthy of taxpayers’ money, while our departments continue to shrink—or disappear altogether—because the school can’t muster the funds to hire permanent professors.,Fluctuations in construction costs and overall changes in the economy are a given for such a long-term project, but the University alarmingly undershot their impact.

Simultaneously, more females are in medical school and are expected to represent 40 per cent of the health industry’s workforce by 2015. The article highlights the increased shortages the industry faces as a result of maternity leaves.,Although Maclean’s intentions may have been to shed light on a prevalent national issue, this article offers a shortsighted perspective on a complex problem.,The article fails to emphasize other sources contributing to the crisis, such as restrictions preventing foreign-trained doctors from practicing and a growing demand for specialized doctors.,Establishing programs to standardize practices for individuals trained abroad would improve Canada’s suffering health sector more than discouraging female doctors from having children—as this article seems to be doing. There’s little motivation for medical school students to become general physicians because of comparatively lower pay and longer hours but Maclean’s ignores this as a significant factor.,Instead of lamenting the influx of women entering Canada’s medical workforce, it might be worth noting how many of those same women—and men—head to the U.S. to practice. The article dedicates a mere paragraph to the implications of the 4,000 Canadian physicians who went south between 1993 and 2004. Whether one or 1,000 of those doctors are women is irrelevant if they aren’t available to Canadians in the first place.,By presenting data that blames the physician shortage on female doctors taking maternity leave, Maclean’s implies the shortage crisis will evaporate if women stop having babies or stay out of the profession altogether.

Jones’s creative writing assignment’s just that—a fictitious piece of work that doesn’t deserve the overreaction it has garnered.,The schools’ decision to ban Jones from attending classes temporarily is punishment unfit for what shouldn’t be considered a crime. It’s wrong to assume a work of fiction involving death indicates its author’s own homicidal tendencies.

Ideally, the Ministry of Education would acknowledge the curriculum’s shortcomings and integrate black history into the existing framework.,Offering all Ontario students Afrocentric history or politics classes would allow teenagers of all backgrounds to learn the value of black culture in an integrative environment and address black students’ alienation from the public school system.,Establishing an Afrocentric school is counterintuitive and seems to be admitting that we’re incapable of accepting cultural coexistence.,To effect any real change, the Ministry of Education and the Toronto District School Board need to devise a plan that emphasizes the integration of cultures—not their segregation."},{"title":"Scary new trend is born","url":"/story/2008-01-22/editorials/scary-new-trend-born/","date":"January 22, 2008","content":"The U.S. teenage birth rate rose in 2006 for the first time in 15 years, Maclean’s magazine reported this week. The article asserts the increase in teenage pregnancies is part of a growing “trend” glamourizing being a young mom.,The article cites recent successful pop-culture phenomena such as Knocked Up and Juno as instigating of this change in attitude towards what used to be a societal taboo. The article also cited a celebrity baby boom as influencing the trend.,A second article in the same issue features two teen mothers in Calgary who discuss the disappearing stigma that used to accompany young motherhood. One of the girls says society’s new change of attitude portrays having a baby “as the new handbag.”,But Maclean’s is only perpetuating the problem it purports to explain. The flashy headlines following 16-year-old Jamie Lynn Spears’s announcement she was pregnant and keeping her baby were a prime example of how media try to profit from and sensationalize what should be a learning experience.,It’s entirely plausible that, far from a fashion trend, teenage pregnancies are on the rise because teens aren’t receiving the information necessary to make educated decisions about sex and contraception. Sufficient sexual education programs in North America are essential to dealing with the problem of unplanned pregnancies.,Girls are increasingly sexualized at a younger age and if they aren’t able to access the proper resources, then Hollywood’s influence becomes prevalent. Teens need the materials to discern reality from a happy cinematic ending.,If someone’s mentality is to associate a handbag with a baby, there’s something skewed about how society is both conveying and interpreting the issue of being a teen mother. The Maclean’s article unfortunately contributes to this mentality without tackling the root of the problem—that the only literature teens are reading about sex may be articles like these."},{"title":"Town-gown standoff","url":"/story/2008-01-22/editorials/town-gown-standoff/","date":"January 22, 2008","content":"Another Christmas break has gone by, and with it, another spate of break-ins in and around the Ghetto. Most Queen’s students don’t seem to be the least bit taken aback by this state of affairs; it seems to be viewed more as a part of student life—along with missing street signs, unkempt streets and garbage and recycling services that are somewhat less than ideal. Apart from the ubiquitous police cars and one weekend a year—you can guess which one I’m referring to—the Ghetto seems to be ignored by Kingston police services and City Council.,The most dangerous part of this relationship is the seeming indifference regarding the number of break-ins that occur over the holidays each year. According to the AMS, residents of the Ghetto were five times more likely than other Kingston residents to have their homes broken into over the break last year. This is one problem that can’t be blamed on the students or the University, and I believe the current situation is unacceptable.,Short of staying in Kingston to stand guard, there’s little students can do to guarantee the safety of their homes over the holidays. And so we must accept the unpleasant reality that we may very well have our possessions stolen and that those responsible will almost certainly not be apprehended. The AMS Holiday Housechecks are a good idea, but they can’t—and don’t—go far enough. Moreover, the vast majority of Ghetto houses aren’t under the University’s jurisdiction and it’s the responsibility of the city and police services to maintain safety and order.,If students feel they’re being neglected by the city, it should be no surprise that this in turn causes them to be alienated from it. This disconnect is part of what causes the destructiveness and disregard for authority seen every fall on Homecoming weekend. I’m not trying to suggest widespread burglaries every December are directly responsible for the irresponsible actions of a minority of students the following autumn. However, it seems to me that the chaos of the very real possibility of having your rented house be ransacked—with rare repercussions—lends the Ghetto a rather “lawless” atmosphere that perpetuates general anarchy when the opportunity presents itself, i.e. a drunken street party smack in the middle of the neighbourhood.,I really can’t point the finger of blame at either the city or the students in this case, but it’s clear that something needs to change to make life more bearable for everyone."},{"title":"A sheepish confession","url":"/story/2008-02-05/editorials/sheepish-confession/","date":"February 5, 2008","content":"They say you can tell if someone’s a genius from early on. If that’s the case, I’m a little bit worried about my own genius—let me tell you a story from my childhood.,One day in kindergarten, my teacher asked us to draw a picture of what we wanted to be when we grew up.,Being an ambitious little bunch, my classmates drew all kinds of cool pictures envisioning their bright future—doctor, astronaut, flight attendant—you name it, they drew it.,But what did little Rosel draw?,A sheep on a mountain.,No, I didn’t want to change the world or find a cure for cancer. Yes, dear reader, I just wanted to grow up to become a docile animal. To this day, I’m not exactly sure what inspired me to draw a sheep on the page as opposed to, say, Miss Universe.,I could have at least drawn an animal that was a little fiercer, a little more independent and a little more exotic. Like… a lion. A dolphin. A peacock. Even a goat! They at least produce delicious cheese and run around the petting zoo amidst enthusiastic kids. But no, my five-year-old self was content being the middle-of-the-road, follower-type sheep, always under careful watch by sheepdogs and shepherds.,How boring.,What else do I remember about this day? I remember my teacher coming around my table, quizzically eyeing my picture, only to exclaim, “Well, you can’t be that!” I remember going home feeling very defeated about my future, and angrily throwing away that picture on the way home. I remember making a teary-eyed confession about the day to my mother—who, I think, comforted me but was probably bewildered and a bit worried about her crazy child’s future.,Well, time has passed. I am now 21 years old, with no more Animorph dreams and about to head out to the world of “real” aspirations.,Maybe because the question, “So, what are you doing in September?” has replaced the “How are you”s of my life, I have been reverting back to my childhood dream a lot and trying to decipher my affinity for sheep in a meaningful way. Maybe my city upbringing is painting an over-idealized perspective on nature, but I find myself becoming more attached to the (imposed views of) peaceful life of an ideal sheep frolicking around in a field with a handsome shepherd.,Maybe that’s what my sheep picture represented—not being an animal itself, but being in a peaceful state of mind, living a slow life. In a world where I sometimes have to tell myself that a two-page assignment worth 10 per cent of my mark isn’t going to ruin my life forever—and having a half-hour lunch break is ok—maybe I do have a lesson to learn from my modest childhood dream. Finally, a note to all kindergarten teachers—please don’t crush little kids’ hopes to be what they want to be; they will still remember your disapproval, even at 21. I mean, who’s to say you can’t follow your dreams?"},{"title":"Getting the wrong picture","url":"/story/2008-01-29/editorials/getting-wrong-picture/","date":"January 29, 2008","content":"Since the first day I took on the role as a photographer for the Journal up until this point, I’ve been sworn at, yelled at, smiled at, frowned at, laughed at, threatened and hit by various objects. All of this has happened while still at the Journal house and not actually out on assignment. When I was actually on assignment, I’ve been covered in mud at the Grease Pole, hit by a puck at a Gaels game, violently threatened by drunk people during Homecoming, and generally regarded as the creepy guy who takes pictures. This, I guess, is all part of the job—to visually document events that may be printed in the media for others to see. Let’s be honest—it’s awkward, creepy, and rather invasive but was it always this way?,When I was younger, I used to be flattered if someone wanted to take a photo of me. Think about what it means to have a photo taken of you—it shows that to the photographer you capture some sort of special emotion or meaning that must be remembered, so a photo is taken.,Now with the media saturation of Facebook and tabloids, both mediums of which are notorious for incredibly unflattering and incriminating photographs, it’s no wonder that we as a society have become wary of a camera lens. It’s no longer the art of capturing special moments; rather, it’s about capturing every moment from sincere to stupid and then showing them to all your friends on your website or off your computer screen.,The rise of media saturation may be because our society is now saturated with cameras. With the advent of digital camera technology, from phones to now-affordable digital single-lens reflex cameras, what was once a hobby-driven market has turned amazingly mainstream, and anyone with a reasonably sized pocket and a working index finger can take photos of anything, anytime. With memory cards that hold hundreds of photos at one time, nothing stops us from literally taking photos all the time.,It has become a reality now that wherever we go there will always be a chance someone might bring that camera and snap you at your worst. Our society revels in our ability to print only embarrassing photos of people, especially concerning celebrities whose personal tragedies or mental breakdowns are deemed newsworthy.,But this is Kingston—any students who feel they’ve reached a sort of celebrity status have to get off their high horses and realize if you’re at a public event worth media attention, you might be photographed.,So the next time you’re in a public place and see a photographer show up, don’t make it awkward for them. You’re not a celebrity—you’re a student—and we’re not here to photograph you at your most awkward moments and then publish them. We’re just trying to do our job and the more you make it seem awkward, the more awkward it inevitably will become."},{"title":"We feel so hoodwinked","url":"/story/2008-02-05/editorials/we-feel-so-hoodwinked/","date":"February 5, 2008","content":"AMS Vice-President (University Affairs) Julia Mitchell is conducting an audit of Orientation Round Table (ORT) spending following allegations of financial mismanagement by this year’s ORT Co-ordinator Ryan Shoemaker.,The ORT’s financial handlings came under review after Commerce Society President Dave Waugh and other society executives brought forward concerns about the bills they received for Frosh Week, many of which were thousands of dollars more than last year’s costs, and more than they had budgeted for.,Waugh said he received a bill for $18,885—$10,000 more than the previous year. The bills had only a one line item, offering no breakdown of where the money had been spent.,Spending was over budget partly because sponsorship totals fell below what Shoemaker and the ORT had projected—only $16,000 of an expected $50,000, leaving the committee short tens of thousands in funding.,Mitchell said every number she has arrived at in her audit differs from those in Shoemaker’s numbers—hardly something to inspire confidence in one’s student leaders and managers.,The ORT’s financial mess is nothing short of embarrassing. A lack of accountability has become almost characteristic of the AMS and faculty societies, but when transparency is merely an oft-uttered buzz word, it reflects poorly on Queen’s ability to select competent and trustworthy leaders.,Shoemaker didn’t make this mess all by himself and he shouldn’t have to clean it up alone, either. Mitchell—as well as Waugh and other society executives—are responsible for student dollars and should be constantly aware of where their money is being spent. If the ORT wasn’t getting the sponsorship money it had hoped to obtain, someone other than Shoemaker should have known about it. Society executives also had an interest in staying abreast of Frosh Week spending so they could budget accordingly—but they apparently remained willfully ignorant until handed a hefty bill.,The lack of communication between faculty societies, the AMS and its committees is nothing new. Financial bungling like this demonstrates the need for substantial reorganization.,The AMS should rethink its “no experience necessary” hiring promise—if monetary dealings figure in the job description, business experience should be a no-brainer pre-requisite. And if the experience isn’t there, it would be worthwhile for the AMS to invest in an accounting course for those employees expected to balance the books.,Mitchell’s audit is likely to reveal what seems painfully apparent: Frosh Week’s system of spending checks and balances is in a sorry state, and doesn’t feel “so good” at all."},{"title":"Hitchcock strikes out","url":"/story/2008-02-12/editorials/hitchcock-strikes-out/","date":"February 12, 2008","content":"Principal Karen Hitchcock released her response to the Athletics Review last Thursday, following more than seven months of consultation with students and other invested parties.,The review was released last June. Its major recommendations included having fewer interuniversity teams to allow for more funding per team, raising athletic fees for students and allowing varsity athletes to pre-register early.,Hitchcock’s report, originally due Dec. 31, suggested all interuniversity and competitive clubs stay active until April 2009, unless Athletics and Recreation Director Leslie Dal Cin calls for a change.,Hitchcock dismissed the proposed early pre-registration as “unviable.” She said a fee hike will be determined by a referendum.,Hitchcock’s much-anticipated report was disappointing, to say the least. Although it’s commendable Hitchcock undertook the review and gave students the opportunity to voice their thoughts, a lot of time and effort were apparently wasted on something that accomplished little to nothing.,The review’s suggestions are long-term projects and Hitchcock’s delay only pushes implementation back further. The principal’s verdict effectively ensures another, identical athletics review will be performed in two years to obtain almost identical results. Given the protracted nature of the latest report, that seems hard to justify.,Hitchcock has taken a cautious approach in her report—something she affirmed after its release when she said she wanted to be “absolutely positive” about what she wrote.,But Hitchcock has erred so much on the side of caution she has effectively made no changes at all. With a whole school year nearly passed before her haphazard response, Queen’s athletics hardly seem to be a top priority for Hitchcock.,The Athletics Review had the potential to improve Queen’s athletics and do so within a foreseeable timeframe. Hitchcock’s call to review interuniversity and competitive teams in another year renders that aspect of the initial report useless and doesn’t say anything concrete about the teams’ futures.,It seems ridiculous that so much time and money went into the Athletics Review, only for it to be reviewed again. As for improving the existing Athletics and Recreation programs, Dal Cin has little room to manoeuver—any major changes could be nullified pending the results of an April 2009 review.,The Athletics Review had a lot of potential and Hitchcock’ s response—and the eight months it took to generate it—knocked some serious wind out of its sails.

But the team admitted it doesn’t have a definition for “anti-oppression,” which could pose an obstacle to achieving their goals.,RWS’s “media expansion project” is less than inspiring: it proposes providing Queen’s TV with more funding and plasma screen TVs, and would push for expansion within CFRC and small media around campus.,There’s no doubt expanding campus media is a worthy project. But QTV suffers from a lack of direction, skill and substance—not just funding. A set of plasma screens in the JDUC won’t make QTV relevant to students.,Wang is an AMS newcomer, and his lack of experience will probably do the team good. Radcliffe’s experience as Campus Affairs Commissioner balances out Wang’s lack thereof and she appears a charismatic and prepared presidential candidate.,St. Clair is equally strong. Her dedication to OUSA and non-academic discipline is commendable, but she needs to better educate herself on provincial and national politics if she wants to represent students.,RWS’s promise to close Tricolour Outfitters and replace it with sustainability-oriented clubs and services is a laudable one and comes long overdue.,One request we have of RWS if they emerge victorious is that they consult calendars regularly. Getting the election dates wrong on your campaign posters is ridiculous.,Team WCW—consisting of presidential candidate Allison Williams, vice-president (operations) candidate Andrew Cameron and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Yanique Williams—presented a platform boasting such long-term initiatives as a diversity certificate, a better location and funding for the Human Rights Office and training for TAs.,It’s vital for platforms to look beyond the next 12 months. But WCW doesn’t seem to have considered how to ensure these long-term projects continue after their term’s up.,A late decision to join the race meant Team WCW was ironing out their platform mid-campaign. There was little coherence between the three members—not nearly enough to inspire confidence in voters—and any innovative or useful ideas they have get lost when they lack the strong leadership to present them.,Team ACH—presidential candidate Holly Archer, vice-president (operations) candidate Jay Collins and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Jeff Howard—got students’ attention with their proposal to keep the PEC and Stauffer Library open 24 hours a day. When some charged the proposal encourages an unhealthy lifestyle, ACH refined it to suggest only “extended hours” at certain times of year. The idea itself seems unwarranted—the demand to lift weights at 4 a.m. isn’t substantial enough to make this initiative worthwhile.,ACH also promised to withhold the AMS’s annual contribution to Queen’s Centre costs if they feel student needs aren’t being met. It’s questionable whether this stance would be beneficial or if it would create unnecessary hostility.,Archer, Collins and Howard have an advantage over the other two teams in terms of AMS experience but it seems their heavy involvement with the AMS has disconnected them from what students actually want.,As a potential vice-president (operations), Jay Collins impressed us with his good grasp on the AMS’s inner workings and he commands attention. Unfortunately, an individual’s strength does not an AMS executive make.,All three groups should be commended on running a campaign with few political gimmicks. Each team brought worthwhile ideas to the campaign, and we sincerely hope whoever wins will appropriate the best parts of the other team’s platforms.,Lack of research and inattention to feasibility have also been issues: the teams presented excellent ideas with no follow-through plans, or even a conception of how such projects could be put into effect.,Regardless of their preferred team, all students should exercise their right to choose their student government by voting today and tomorrow."},{"title":"Microblogging 101","url":"/story/2008-02-08/editorials/microblogging-101/","date":"February 8, 2008","content":"A recent web toy has arrived to suit our 30-second attention spans. To my delight, it comes dressed in glossy colours reminiscent of the slickest digital art.,It’s also aptly named after our aural apprehension of birds.,The product is called Twitter. Twitter is a web application that allows its users to blog in quick, sporadic entries over any given moment. It’s part-Facebook, part-blog and part-text messaging neatly compressed into a light-weight, visualrific web tool designed for the “blog-and-go” demographic. The application records your thoughts and doings as you blog along your day—kind of like a running diary of your every move and activity.,Twitter isn’t the only popular microblog tool, of course. There’s Soup.io, Pownce, Tumblr, Jaiku and others that cater similarly to your exhibitionist needs. Web giants Facebook and Myspace, with their cluttered profile pages, are yesteryear; the latest evolution of our user-generated content comes now in simple, quick and microsleek packages.,Microblogging allows your audience to follow you around your most tedious tasks. For example, your 9 a.m. snippet of consciousness about brushing your teeth is read and circulated online like an instant message sent to everyone on the internet. With microblogging, the user broadcasts his or her information to a world wide web audience. Fans of Twitter (‘Twitterholics’) will argue it’s a great application to expand your social network, although I assume it does little for your privacy and even less for your real-life social life.,Web communication products like Twitter have certainly taken a large portion over our social lives, and enabled us to keep in touch with others better than ever. Despite that, my concern lies in whether these tools have commodified our personal lives into disposable, superficial little media experiments. In other words, our social relationships seem to have become no better than digitalized mini-pieces of shallow information.,I’m sure Twitter has some important uses, such as allowing parents to keep up with the mundane activities of children attending school away or letting employers keep tabs on their employees. The hype of Twitter circles around its frequent-updating abilities, after all. But none of this is helped by the fact that the representation of the user is an artificial construction; the real personality simply can’t be compressed into 25-sentence-long self-descriptions, spat onto the screen in several bursts of instant entries. Instead of connecting, microblogs tend to do more of the opposite—they disconnect by branding the user in front of a computer screen, isolating him or her within one web page. Realistically, you build your relationships under many years of real contact and interaction.,I do think, however, in our fast-paced digital age, tools like Twitter can probably be more enabling and useful than not. But given the materialization by social media of what was once very immaterial about ourselves, I still think it’s weird that anyone with a Twitter or a Facebook account will unquestionably feed large chunks of his or her personal life into a network facilitated by a bunch of Silicon Valley supergeeks."},{"title":"AMS musical chairs","url":"/story/2008-02-15/editorials/ams-musical-chairs/","date":"February 15, 2008","content":"AMS executive-elect Talia Radcliffe, Ken Wang and Stephanie St. Clair announced their new council Sunday.

It’s not clear how the executive determined these people are the best for their jobs—they certainly seemed surprised to find out what they were hired for.

My main procrastination method is at stake here because I spend more time playing Scrabble online than I do most other things in my life.,Or perhaps I should say I spend an unnecessary amount of time playing games with names very similar to Scrabble, but which aren’t actually because the games have illegally copied the world’s most popular word game without obtaining the proper licensing rights.,Last year, two brothers—Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla—uploaded their Scrabulous application to Facebook, inviting users to play Scrabble online with friends (or strangers).,You play at your convenience—the wait between turns can be days or, if you’re as much of an addict as myself, mere seconds—and you can show off your knowledge of obscure, high-scoring words with friends on the other side of the globe with whom you wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to play.,According to a CBC report, it’s among the 10 most popular Facebook applications with almost 600,000 daily users. When the application’s popularity came to the attention of game makers Hasbro and Mattel, they asked Facebook to remove it.,I’m kind of torn here. Yes, the brothers who made the application are infringing on Mattel and Hasbro’s copyright. They aren’t, however, making any profit off of doing so. They’re encouraging people—people who might not otherwise be playing Scrabble—to engage in the word game.,A statement released by Hasbro suggests fans of Scrabulous instead use authorized online versions of the game.

Although it was refreshing to see platforms that diverged in terms of their goals and stances, RWS’s 0.1 per cent victory over Archer-Collins-Howard means no consensus was reached.,On the other hand, RWS’s less-than-decisive victory will hopefully mean innovative changes next year—it would be an injustice on RWS’s part to ignore the proposals made by the other teams, which many voters clearly supported.,RWS needs to address ACH’s corporate focus and WCW’s social issues concerns if they want to be truly representative.,ACH’s accounting initiative is a makeover the AMS’s financial face desperately needs.,Team Williams-Cameron-Williams’s,ardent promotion of diversity on campus—an issue RWS also touched on—is a crucial topic that needs to be tangilbly addressed next year, whether in the form of a diversity certificate or institutionalized anti-oppression initiatives.,Closing Tricolour Outfitters is a good idea and RWS would be wise to follow through on it. If replaced by a “green space” as Wang proposed it would aid the team’s aim to create a “greener U.”,President-elect Talia Radcliffe will undeniably have a strong presence. She has a fierce personality and seems prepared to address the AMS inadequacies with which she has become familiar.,We can only hope this race’s tightness will push student voters to take responsibility for the University’s direction. Every vote counts, and St. Clair put it best when thanking her team’s supporters, astutely observing that if one person had forgotten to vote, Team RWS would have been “fucked.”,It’s difficult to say at this point whether some campaign promises were empty rhetoric, but it certainly seemed that way when the Engineering Society’s election results were announced.,For a faculty plagued by accountability and transparency woes—something President-elect Jordan Black said he hopes to improve—EngSoc’s results were far from transparent. Chief Returning Officer Mark Syer told the Journal he didn’t feel it necessary to disclose the count’s final numbers, instead just proclaiming a winner and loser.,Stonewalling reporters and the public reflects poorly on Syer and EngSoc, and offers little credibility to calls for more oversight that have come from chartered accountants, the University’s liquor-licence holder and the EngSoc president-elect, alike.,A free and fair election means publicizing results. Taking someone’s word in lieu of concrete numbers is hardly transparent and doesn’t do much to instill confidence in a faculty plagued by irresponsible administrative and financial goings-on.,Similarly, Arts and Science Undergraduate Society President-elect Jacob Mantle was far from forthcoming following the announcement of his victory early Thursday morning. Mantle refused to speak to the Journal without his running mate Dominique Vanier, who seemed to be missing in action for several hours.,It’s disconcerting to know the largest undergraduate society will soon be run by a duo whose team aspect was lacking before their victory was even announced.,Last night, Team ACH requested a recount of the ballots. Election policy permits only one recount done by hand. Thursday’s early morning recount, however, was done using computers so the request was allowed.,ACH’s decision to ask for a recount was the right one—the team should fully exercise their right to ask for the ballots to be tallied again. Not only is it part of the democratic process, but it will hopefully legitimize the election’s razor-thin margin.,Whatever the final outcome, it’s important the incoming AMS executive regard its win as a narrow victory.

The irony is the biggest changes aren’t visible.,As I recently drove down Princess Street to Japan Camera, I realized not much about my looks have changed, while every other aspect of my life has evolved dramatically. The sheer fact that I was driving myself to get my photo taken was impossible five years ago and I remember on that day in Grade 10, rollerblades were my wheels of choice.,A friend had jokingly given me a makeover for my first-ever passport photo and it turned out half decent. This time I forewent any sort of preparation altogether. It’s amazing how vividly those new cameras can capture lack of sleep.,High school concerns such as not forgetting my locker combo have been replaced with trying to figure out where my life is going.,I have seen and experienced amazing parts of the world, embodied by the inked pages of my once-blank passport.,Even the passport rules are different. In my old picture, I was smiling. New regulations that comply with International Civil Aviation Organization standards don’t allow for so much as a smirk because it will essentially make it harder for technology of the future to identify a face.,My old and new photos don’t show faded friendships or restored ones, my accomplishments or failures.,Really the only prominent change—not to underestimate the hygienic importance of this one—is my clothing.,So next time you’re driving—or rollerblading—to get your picture taken, think back to where you were five years ago. Whether that thought brings on a smile or frown, or another facial contortion, make sure you wipe it from your face before the flash goes off."},{"title":"Redefining the mission","url":"/story/2008-01-25/editorials/redefining-mission/","date":"January 25, 2008","content":"A 90-page report released this week recommends Canada stay in Afghanistan and refocus its NATO-led deployment to emphasize diplomacy, reconstruction and training of Afghan forces. The report was written by an independent panel headed by former Liberal cabinet minister John Manley.,Canada’s scheduled mission ends in early 2009, but Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government has indicated it wants to keep troops there for at least another two years.,The report calls for an indefinite extension of Canada’s deployment provided NATO’s International Security Assistance Force deploys another 1,000 troops to Kandahar province and the government obtain medium-lift helicopters and high-performance unmanned aerial vehicles—all by the expected withdrawal date in 2009.,The Afghan mission has been a major initiative for Canadian troops. But Canada’s 78th casualty was killed by an improvised explosive device Thursday, and polls suggest Canadians are increasingly skeptical of this mission. It’s vital the mission be re-evaluated and more clear-cut goals established.,A pullout in early 2009 would have dire consequences for a country and population still fragile from decades of occupations that left a shattered infrastructure and citizens skeptical of international intervention.,At the same time, the mission can’t continue unconditionally. Harper’s government needs to look at the ongoing volatility in Afghanistan and develop a timeline that considers what’s best for both Afghanistan and Canada.,U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates sparked Canadian indignation last week when he said NATO troops are ill-suited to combat Taliban insurgents. Despite having apologized for his comments, Gates seemed to be getting at a very real truth: NATO troops are tired and need additional assistance.,When foreign troops land in a country toting guns and professing to spread democracy, they’re likely to be met with distrust, and rightly so. International troops’ missteps, notably the abuse of detainees transferred to the Afghan police, seriously jeopardize the little faith the Afghan people have left in NATO troops to mend their war-torn country.,Harper has said the deployment will go to a vote later this year. But first, the mission needs to be redefined. Scaling back now would do more harm than good in a place where little visible good has been done at all."},{"title":"Tight lips sink ships, too","url":"/story/2008-02-08/editorials/tight-lips-sink-ships-too/","date":"February 8, 2008","content":"Last week, two incidents of racism were reported after Queen’s students turned in posters vandalized with racist messages and signed by stormfront.org, a white supremacist Internet group.,The posters were found along University Avenue and were turned in to the Queen’s Human Rights Office. One poster was an advertisement for the Human Rights Office’s “Colour of Poverty” event held Jan. 31. The second poster was a “For Rent” sign.,The University issued a press release on Monday in which Principal Karen Hitchcock denounced the behaviour as “intolerable in a civilized society.” The press release also stated the University intends to work with the city to foster a racism-free environment and to collaborate with Kingston police in any subsequent investigations.,Missing from the press release, however, was any mention of what was written on the posters.,It’s against the Human Rights Office’s policy to discuss the particulars of reported incidents. It’s possible the University felt by withholding the messages’ racist content, it was depriving the culprits of gratification. Although based on valid concerns, failing to publicize details of the vandalism risks allowing it to be ignored.,Censorship in such a context is detrimental to the student body as a whole—racism in our community needs to be exposed and discussed openly if students are to fully understand the consequences of such incidents. Many people don’t realize the inflammatory nature of racist sentiments or actions until they’re forced to deal with them first-hand.,Organizing events such as the Rally Against Racism on Jan. 16 was a step in the right direction, but any gain is lost if we can’t openly discuss another racist incident only weeks later. Incorporating issues of race and ethnicity into Queen’s core curriculum would bring the matter to the surface and force students to realize its troubling prevalence.,The inclination to keep such incidents quiet does little to stop racism from spreading. At best, these incidents give Queen’s a chance to do something tangible and act on these situations we so readily condemn."},{"title":"The campus connection","url":"/story/2008-02-01/editorials/campus-connection/","date":"February 1, 2008","content":"“So, you work for the Journal? That’s awesome! What do you do?”,“Well, I write sports stories.”,“Oh ... that’s cool. I guess.”,I’ve had the above conversation—or variants thereof—far too many times since I started writing for the Journal last year. In my opinion, it’s pretty indicative of the place sports—particularly those of the Queen’s variety—hold on this campus. To be fair, my own feelings in first year weren’t all that different. I went to many Gaels’ hockey games, lured by the promise of a former NHL star as head coach but somehow managed to avoid caring too much about the rest of the campus teams.,I still read the Journal’s sports section regularly back then but when I went to apply to work for the paper, covering campus sports was far from my mind—I wanted the glamour and intrigue of covering news and politics. Back then, I loved playing sports and watching professional games but I couldn’t seem to get too excited about university teams. Well, has that ever changed. I managed to fluke my way into writing for the sports section regularly last year and found the world of campus sports was far more exciting than I thought.,There’s a very high calibre of play in Queen’s sports, making them exciting to watch and report on. But what made the job even better was the chance to meet some of the most interesting people on campus. There’s the coaches who have invested large amounts of their lives into training student-athletes to fulfill their physical and mental potential, the trainers and managers who do far more than they get credit for; and, most notably, the athletes themselves.,Anyone who ever calls athletes lazy or selfish should go and meet any of our Gaels—they deal with all the academic stress that goes with being a student at Queen’s while also putting in huge amounts of time at practice, in the gym and on road trips. Despite the strenuous nature of their own sports and their academics, many of them choose to spend their free time cheering on fellow athletes from different sports. Huge egos are remarkably absent when speaking with these athletes—the stereotype of muscle-bound jocks taking courses such as “The Significance of Tiled Streets” while running roughshod over a campus is anything but true at Queen’s. Instead, we have a surplus of remarkably nice people who will take a few minutes to speak to reporters even after tough losses, who go out of their way to show their appreciation to fans and who never complain about the stress and pressure of being a varsity athlete at a fiercely academic school.,My work at the Journal has given me a new appreciation for what these campus athletes do. The world of sports has much to offer, especially on the big stages of the professional leagues. I love to see the best competition and covering bigger events would certainly be fun to do someday. But there will always be a special place in my heart for the lesser-publicized athletes of this world—the few, the proud, the Gaels."},{"title":"The truth is ugly","url":"/story/2008-02-12/editorials/truth-ugly/","date":"February 12, 2008","content":"It’s not easy to report on race.,In last Friday’s issue of the Journal, the paper was criticized for its editorial handling of the debate over black-focused schools—the Feb. 5 talking heads section conspicuously failed to ask the opinions of any black students—and for misrepresenting two high-profile incidents of on-campus racism as the only incidents of racism at Queen’s this year. In that same issue, the Journal offered criticism of its own, in an editorial condemning the University’s decision not to reveal the actual content of the racist messages scrawled on two posters found on-campus this month.,How we should report on race—whether as journalists, institutions or individuals—is obviously a contentious issue. And it has been so for many years, according to Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff’s Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the press’s role in the civil rights struggle, The Race Beat. What they reveal is a long and protracted debate over our responsibilities, in our public discussions of so significant and so personal a subject as race, to truth and to social justice. Shaping this debate are the numerous decisions people have made as to what’s worth reporting about race and what isn’t—in short, what makes race “news.”,In honour of Black History Month, I thought I would share some highlights:,On Aug. 11, 1946, a New York Times editorial announced a groundbreaking change in how they would cover race. Thenceforth, a person’s race would not be mentioned unless it was relevant to the story. Three years later, the Queen’s Journal seems not to have wholly adopted this policy, as revealed by a passing reference to “our coloured mascot, Alfie Pierce.”,In 1947, the Arkansas Gazette set a new standard among white papers in the Southern U.S. when they changed their policy to make courtesy titles consistent for people of all races. Previously, according to The Race Beat, “journalistic orthodoxy … demanded that newspapers unfailingly refer to white women as “Miss” or “Mrs.” but drop the title when referring to Negro women, no matter what their station in life.” More insulting still, “a Negro woman, on second reference, traditionally would be referred to by her last name, as in ‘the Jones woman.’”,Perhaps the most provocative story—and the most pertinent to the University’s decision not to divulge what the racist messages on the posters were—is that of Mamie Bradley, mother of Emmett Till. Her decision to display her son’s tortured and mutilated corpse in an open casket in Chicago for all to see, and her later decision to allow Jet to publish a close-up photo of the body, provided a harrowing image of racism’s horrendous costs.,Mrs. Bradley was attacked and condemned by many—some liberal white journalists included—for what she did. Her decision to publicize such an awful truth was courageous, but the principle behind it remains controversial to this day. How long can we bear to gaze upon our own ugliness? How long is too long?"},{"title":"Saudi rape verdict a violation","url":"/story/2007-11-23/editorials/saudi-rape-verdict-violation/","date":"November 23, 2007","content":"A 19-year-old woman in Saudi Arabia who was gang raped by seven men has been sentenced to six months in prison and 200 lashings. Initially, the woman was sentenced to 90 lashes for travelling in a car with an unrelated male. The lashings were more than doubled and a jail sentenced added to her punishment on the basis that the woman was attempting to “aggravate and influence the judiciary through the media,” according to the Globe and Mail.,The woman was said to have violated the country’s Islamic sharia law prohibiting women from being in the company of men outside of their family by getting into a car with a male friend. More men climbed in the car and drove to a secluded spot where she was raped 14 times. Seven men were convicted in the case and sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to nine years.,The court’s decision has sparked international outcry including condemnation from Canada’s minister responsible for the status of women, Josée Verner, who called the decision “barbaric.”,The U.S., however, called the ruling “astonishing” but seemed to shrug off this egregious abuse of women’s rights. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack cited Saudi Arabia’s sovereignty as reason for his country’s silence. Sadly it’s not shocking—the U.S. can’t afford to aggravate the oil-rich country.,The humanitarian aspect of this case is most disturbing—a woman who was raped by seven men received not only jail time, but a corporal punishment increased because she spoke out. Rape isn’t an uncommon abuse, but public acknowledgement of it is. Punishing a victim of physical violation with another form of it is incomprehensible.,The court’s decision will undoubtedly discourage other women from coming forward and will propogate an image of rape victims as being the culprits. If a woman is punished for a crime she didn’t commit—or provoke—justice is denied.,Such an abrogation of human rights can’t be met with silence if we as a society want to combat rape victims’ stigma. The abuses of power in this case—by the rapists and the Saudi court—are shameful and place blame on a victim guilty only of being an outspoken woman."},{"title":"Queen’s shorts on sustainability","url":"/story/2007-11-29/editorials/queens-shorts-sustainability/","date":"November 29, 2007","content":"Comparison with other Canadian universities finds that Queen’s is lagging on environmental sustainability. While UBC is celebrating 10 years of having a sustainability office, Queen’s is only now announcing its intention to create one. Landfill use has been a major problem for Queen’s and a composting system has yet to be implemented. Any food waste from the cafeterias goes to landfill but Physical Plant Services (PPS) information co-ordinator Rebecca Spaulding suggested that as Kingston\nplans to implement a composting system, the University will likely follow.,Other green projects underway include a $335,000 retrofit to replace inefficient light fixtures in hallways, classrooms and offices on campus. The University has said it will pay for the retrofit if the costs are covered in savings within three years.,Spaulding said she believed most students have at least a drive to recycle. Although PPS has initiated a project to make recycling bins more visible on campus, labelling what goes where isn’t the reason students are tossing water bottles into garbage cans. Recycling bins are rare sights in many Queen’s buildings and if we want to reduce waste, there needs to be a recycling container for every garbage can on campus.,Projects such as the retrofit lighting system are steps in the right direction but the effort’s hamstrung if the University puts unreasonable time constraints based on their perceived cost-effectiveness.,Environmental sustainability isn’t a goal that can be achieved in a few years. While the University claims to be thinking long-term, its short-sighted actions indicate otherwise. The University’s priorities are skewed—rapid climate change is demonstrating that our practices aren’t sustainable and serious adjustments have to be made.,The Queen’s Centre will be the first campus building deemed environmentally friendly by the leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating system. Although this project—and endeavours such as retrofitting—shows some commitment to sustainability, there’s a lot more Queen’s should do to generate a greener campus."},{"title":"A lesson in school safety","url":"/story/2008-01-15/editorials/lesson-school-safety/","date":"January 15, 2008","content":"A recently released report paints a grim and frightening picture of schools in the Toronto District School Board. The School Community Safety Advisory Panel Report, commissioned last year after the shooting death of 15-year-old Jordan Manners at C.W. Jefferys Collegiate Institute, found many district schools are rife with violence, sexual harassment and a “culture of fear” preventing both students and teachers from coming forward regarding these incidents.,Equally frightening as the violence itself is witnesses’ reluctance to report violent incidents—indicating how afraid students and teachers are of singling themselves out for the same treatment.,The report also mentions the failure of transferring troubled or troublesome students from one school to another. It’s clear juggling students from school to school accomplishes nothing but make them someone else’s problem while transplanting students who are already having a hard time functioning in their school environment, denying them the support they need.,This 1,000-page report presents a damning view of a system so broken it makes the Ontario Liberals’ “Safe Schools Act” a bitter joke. But the prevalence of violence in this school district is certainly not unique to Toronto or Ontario: police started patrolling Calgary schools last year, and have been doing so in Guelph since 2001; last May, a Fredericton high school suspended a student with a gun in his backpack and, a week later, suspended another, found with explosives.,It’s apparent efforts to reduce violence in Canadian schools isn’t working.,At best, they address superficial problems on a haphazard level: merely punishing students caught with weapons or assaulting others addresses a tiny portion of those incidents and does nothing to prevent their recurrence.,At worst, they push a problem under the rug enough for it to be out of sight and out of mind, allowing violent or troubled students to be shuffled from one place to another as they continue to pose a threat to their classmates and themselves.,This, and other school boards, need to take a hard look at the environment in which Canadian children are going to school—and what they’re learning there."},{"title":"Green China in the bag?","url":"/story/2008-01-11/editorials/green-china-bag/","date":"January 11, 2008","content":"On Tuesday, China’s State Council announced a countrywide ban on plastic shopping bags beginning June 1.,Anyone who sells, makes or distributes the thin plastic bags, which are notorious polluters because of how long they take to decompose, will be fined or have their goods and profits seized.,China’s decision comes on the heels of San Francisco’s decision last March to ban non-recyclable plastic bags. Leaf Rapids, Man. has also jumped on board, and countries such as South Africa have placed extra taxes on plastic bags to discourage their use.,Although China’s decision is commendable, it’s only as good as its implementation strategy. Uganda banned thin plastic bags in October, 2007, but the bags’ sales continue. This demonstrates the potential ineffectiveness of such a policy, especially in a country such as China, which demonstrated its spotty record in manufacturing oversight with this summer’s spate of product recalls. It would be disappointing if China made this policy a token gesture without a concrete follow-through plan.,But the onus to reduce pollution doesn’t lie on solely on consumers, which is what policies like this suggest. It’s time to start holding industries accountable for their energy consumption. If the West wants to point fingers at countries such as China, perhaps we should stop consuming goods produced in those countries and residually benefiting from low costs associated with cheap labour and a disregard for the environment.,The time has long passed for Canada and the United States to stop hiding behind the environmental failures of countries such as China.

I’m not a biology major but I know that an average male has a penis, while your typical female has a vagina. You have one or the other. To quote Abraham Lincoln, “We hold these truths to be self-evident.” Go ahead, have a look. Honest Abe never told a lie.,The other differences may not be so obvious. The 21st-century man and woman are more similar than ever before. Women are no longer the “fairer sex” that we once believed them to be and the “gentleman” is now a thing of the past. Sometimes it seems all that separates them is anatomy.,There are no gentlemen and there are no ladies. Now, there are guys and there are girls. To have sex is now a “hook-up” and that’s as casual as a well-worn pair of Levi’s. That’s what it’s become. At least at Queen’s and other North American universities And it’s the same culture in high school, too. What happened to boy meets girl? What happened to love?,To be a gentleman once meant more than simply having a penis. I believe many years ago there was something called chivalry. I think it’s in a museum now, next to meaningful sex and the importance of one’s virginity. Once upon a time, a man was someone who held the door for a lady, walked nearer to the street than his companion, and generally practiced the now-lost art of courtship. I think I read that somewhere.,Most university students will tell you that “courtship” is an Old English word for “alcohol” and that it’s more popular than ever, at house parties and nightclubs around the world. That’s how it’s done these days. Chivalry is no more than a novelty. When a man and woman are on a date, and the man holds the door for the woman, it’s almost a surprise. Or it’s “cute” for just being so unusual. That’s not right. It should be expected.,I think that the reason gentlemen are so rare is because a lady is just as hard to find. Many women don’t want a man to hold the door for them, or to pick up the tab at dinner, or to offer their coat on a cold night. That’s because many collegiate men and women aren’t going out for dinner. And it’s not just men who would rather go to the bar or a kegger. Women are just as eager as men to get drunk and make some bad decisions. Some want to be “friends with benefits.” Some want a one-night stand. Women are the new men. And men haven’t changed since being a gentleman went out of style.,I consider myself to be a gentleman. That’s not to say that I consider myself a saint. My university career has involved more alcohol, house parties, and nightclubs (I mean ‘courtship’) than I care to remember. What’s important is that I believe in the old-fashioned ideals of being a gentleman. Come on, Queen’s, let’s bring chivalry back.,All I’m saying is, let’s remember what it means to be a man or a woman, no matter your preference. Male and female are not just the two ends of a hook-up."},{"title":"Monopolies still on air","url":"/story/2008-01-18/editorials/monopolies-still-air/","date":"January 18, 2008","content":"On Tuesday, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) released new provisions intended to curb mergers in Canadian media.,The CRTC announced three major rules that seem to be a direct response to the ongoing expansion of media conglomerates such as CTVglobemedia Inc. and CanWest Global Communications Corp. As Canada’s two biggest media corporations, they’re subject to criticism for their monopolistic hold on numerous print, television and radio sources.,The regulator announced a gradual system of colours—green, amber or red—to approve or disapprove proposed media mergers and acquisitions. The first rule stipulates that a company’s television assets will be blocked from expanding when they reach 45 per cent of all Canadian viewership. The second prevents one company from owning all forms of TV delivery service, such as cable or satellite, in one local market. The third major provision prevents a monopoly on owning all three of radio, TV and newspaper in a market, limiting ownership to only two of these mediums.,Although the CRTC should be commended for implementing a barrier to monopolies in the media market, they don’t deserve a full pat on the back—Canada’s,media market has desperately needed legislation to prevent media monopolies for years. This law’s inability to work retroactively means it may be too little, too late.,For the most part, big conglomerates such as CTVglobemedia, CanWest Global and Quebecor will find their empires relatively untouched by the new rules, although ongoing acquisitions will prove challenging.,This monopoly-driven homogeneity is felt most acutely in small local markets, where less range in media outlets available means it’s easier for one company to dominate news sources.,Unless the regulations are revised to incorporate retroactive measures, the media conglomerates will maintain their strongholds.,The dangers of media monopolies are obvious and the CRTC’s regulations now leave the conglomerates to maintain their vast ownership without worrying about possible competition springing up.

A favourable crowd can act as a seventh player on a team, and having a regular playing environment makes athletes much more comfortable. In professional sports, arenas such as Maple Leaf Gardens, Chicago’s United Centre and the Montreal Forum provided a mystique and aura that had the potential to put visiting teams on their heels.,Professional hockey teams are generally more successful at home than on the road (an exception is this year’s circus-like edition of the Toronto Maple Leafs). But the Gaels will have to do their best in 28 road games this season.,The men’s team is trying to make the best of their situation.

The program advocates purchasing apparel from factories that have ethical labour practices and is spearheaded by the Worker’s Rights Consortium, an independent labour activist group based in Washington, D.C. By signing onto the DSP, Queen’s would join 30 American schools in the program and would be the first Canadian school to do so.,The program includes a three-year phase-in system wherein the participating universities’ licensees must gradually adjust their practices until 75 per cent of their purchasing is sourced from DSP-approved factories by the third year.,The University’s apparent reluctance to join the program stems from challenges ensuring supplier factories comply with the program’s regulations, said Queen’s Trademark Licensing Co-ordinator Debra Easter. In order for a factory to qualify for DSP status, at least 50 per cent of its output must be for colleges and universities. Easter said this quota isn’t feasible for Queen’s.,The issue of purchasing sweatshop-free clothing is not a new issue on campus. Queen’s Oxfam have repeatedly lobbied the University to amend its lax purchasing policies. Fair labour practices aren’t a concern that will disappear if ignored, and although implementing the program may be “cumbersome”, as Dean of Student Affairs Jason Laker has said, that isn’t an excuse for inaction. It’s justified for the University to be apprehensive—being the only Canadian university involved with the program would be a challenge and our impact may be minimal. What isn’t justified would be to do nothing while claiming to look for other alternatives. Finding another initiative that would be more beneficial to Queen’s is a worthy idea, but it should be done in conjunction with whatever efforts can be made under the DSP.,Implementing such a system at Queen’s would ensure the school kept up the progress rather than just signing the papers.,The best option right now is to accept its smaller role in the DSP. If we choose to go it alone with an as-yet undetermined purchasing policy, Queen’s will be entirely ineffectual.,Queen’s can and should explore alternative programs while adopting the DSP’s goals in the interim.

The act of categorizing knowledge into disciplines may be counter-intuitive to the pursuit of knowledge.,For instance, how will the future scientists of our society effect change if they don’t realize science itself can’t solve the problems of science? Such a value-rationale resembles more a tautology than a tangible solution to the problems our society faces.,How will the commerce students ever effect change if they’re not exposed to the harsh realities of global capitalism?  Without a balanced education in the social sciences, the commerce major limits their understanding of the world to a discourse of market relations and individual entitlement.   ,If there’s one thing the social sciences can do, it’s help liberate our understandings by recognizing the inherent power relations and ideological assumptions in our everyday lives. We can’t simply continue treating knowledge as a means to an end, for it is an end in itself. We must understand that the pursuit of knowledge is something greater than ourselves.  I believe the social sciences exemplify this, and until we free knowledge from the institutional constraints that structure our disciplines, knowledge will remain a means to an end and we will continue to miss the point.  "},{"title":"Oh.

I wasn’t kidding when I said anything.,I need something to tell the relatives, friends, coworkers and random strangers who sweetly inquire, “And what are you doing next year?” If I have a list of possible futures already conjured up, I can reply confidently to their question with, “Well, Great-Aunt Edna, I’ve discovered, after four years of university, that my true calling lies in the field of nesting-doll creation.”,And while I recognize I’ll be telling a blatant lie, it will be for the questioners’ own good because it will save them the time and effort of consoling me if I were to give a truthful reply to their generic query.,The real answer would be, “Well, Great-Aunt Edna, I’ve discovered after eight years of elementary school, four years of high school, four years of university and countless part-time jobs and volunteer positions, that I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing after I receive my diploma in early June and as of right now and for the foreseeable future I am option-less, jobless and hopeless.” If the poor soul forced to endure that response had not already wandered off during that mini rant, then they will quickly do so after hastily assuring me that “something will come up.”,As selfless as this seems, however, I would ultimately be compiling this list in order to calm myself. As someone used to having a plan, a list, a direction, getting ready to graduate in April sans firm plans for the future has been more than a little disconcerting (read: terrifying).,I am determined to find a career in a field that I am passionate about and eager to devote my time and energy to. But this might be more than a tad idealistic as both financial and deadline constraints are closing in on my window of possibilities.,Searching for a direction is frustrating if only because the sheer number of possible paths to follow is often juxtaposed against the seeming impossibility of beating out the who-knows-how-many other applicants also wanting space on that narrow path of choice.,Poorly designed roadways aside, I’m slowly coming to terms with the cloud of uncertainty that seems to plague more than a few graduating students. I’ll continue to source out options and continue to apply, all the while cognizant that perhaps I have yet to settle on a specific job, internship or graduate program for fear of applying and being rejected. Regardless (and in blissful denial of the debt it will incur), I am committed to pursuing a graduate program in line with my interests and hoping that I will find the right fit in the career world.,While I don’t have a job waiting for me at the end of April, I am coming into the real world with a much more defined sense of myself—my interests, passions, strengths and limitations. In the meantime I can continue to lie about my plans: what sounds better—macramé artist or haberdasher?"},{"title":"Ti(red) of the consumer cause","url":"/story/2007-11-09/editorials/tired-consumer-cause/","date":"November 9, 2007","content":"Rubber bracelets, an iPod and a T-shirt—is this an ensemble that can save the world? Somehow the current trend of shopping for “The Cause” comes across as counter-intuitive to say the least. As if companies tagging products with specific colours to symbolise causes and cures could elevate the great North American trend to meaningful levels. Buying a red iPod translates into $10 going towards The Global Fund to Fight Aids. Cool. I can buy Kleenex to support breast cancer. Right on.,At first glance this seems not so bad. If you’re in the market for these products, why not ensure that a small fraction of your spending goes somewhere? But what does it mean when companies begin capitalizing on international crises like the AIDS pandemic, poverty and global warming? Suddenly they become brands. Activism becomes a consumable.,When the PRODUCT (RED) campaign was launched last year, Apple, The Gap, Hallmark, American Express and others collaborated with musical celebrity Bono to make these products available. Admittedly, these major players, in combination, can probably rake in a hell of a lot for the fund due to their rabid popularity. Placing the power of donation in the consumer’s hands probably makes us feel a little, but more, in control, and gives us the illusion we’re agents in the face of one fucked up world. However, the onus is on the consumer as opposed to these companies who have already chosen where to direct the funds. Couldn’t Apple donate a percentage of their profits to the fund, regardless of buyers?,I do think it’s a problem when we let institutions with a clearly vested interest in making money tell us how to act and dictate what to care about. The Gap wouldn’t be advocating the cause if they weren’t making profit—which they are. If the company were as ethical as its celebrity-ridden, awareness-raising advertisements would have us believe, maybe they’d look at who assembles their clothing and begin treating their workers with dignity. Wait, that’s not as profitable or sexy as Gisele in a tank top. Lately there are loads of T-shirts and bags sporting “Go-Green” pro-environmentalism slogans. But is this really enough? I think we have to face the facts that in terms of the environment, any consumption we do needs to be greatly reduced and turned local. It’s part of consumer culture to feel as though purchasing is an action that accomplishes something. Awareness and activism go beyond sporting a bright colour.,We have to consider if mainstream trend-dictators catching on to global concerns is really progress or if we’re just pacifying our guilty middle-class consumer consciences by buying and buying into capitalist whims. Do we pick up our American Express Red or picket-signs and pens and start talking back? These products reduce complicated problems to abstractions and colours. We need to see beyond the red or green or pink and start some serious dialogue."},{"title":"The last word","url":"/story/2007-11-29/editorials/last-word/","date":"November 29, 2007","content":"Well, sort of. It’s not the last word in any kind of Old Testament mass hysteria sense—I’m not trying to suggest it’s the end of the world. What I mean is this is the last signed editorial for the Journal until January, meaning no more Journal until the New Year and so I’m left writing the last word for you.,Beyond the ontological trickery involved in suggesting this supposed last word, I feel this extra sense of pressure to try to say something meaningful. For a last word is like that final essay or exam you’re about to write—despite its pressure, it needs to be done.,I can’t help but sympathize here for obituary writers. Now they must have a stressful job. Each day would be like writing that final essay, only it’s not for your professor, but anyone who cares to read it. Worse still, you have to put yourself in someone else’s skin and try to say something meaningful\nabout their existence. Every day at work would be like facing a whole new existential crisis. What absurdity!,The last word is in fact very existential, for such words necessarily contain a deep ontological relationship to the self. What you make of last words says a lot about who you are, and you know that despite what you say, you will be judged by others. You will be evaluated, compared and scrutinized. And this continues throughout your life. It’s sort of like that existential angst Martin Heidegger speaks of—that deep feeling of anxiousness when we think about how free we really are to live our lives authentically.,We’re free, and that’s a cause of angst for it means that it’s up to you and only you to live authentically. Not to bend to someone else’s will, not to live the life of a bell curve, but to assert yourself as a free individual and willfully choose your life. This is no easy task, and surely a great cause of anxiety—to face the world, see its utter absurdity, and even, if necessary, turn your back on it. This may not seem like it’s for everyone, but regardless, everyone has to choose the way they live, even when it seems like there’s no choice. This may be the perception a lot of people share, that we\nreally don’t have that much choice. From biological determinists to the cultural relativists who assert their knowledge to excuse their existence because, from this perspective, existence is really\njust pre-determined from an endless series of causes and events.,I would suggest otherwise. In fact these determinists and relativists have indeed made a choice not to choose. It is a forfeiture of one’s existential freedom, and so they go through life wandering, having\nconvinced themselves they know the answer and yet, can’t quite explain that sense of incompleteness felt deep down, hidden from the gaze and scrutiny of others.,So what’s the last word? There isn’t one. Despite this angst, there will always be choices, and always freedom to exist how you choose. So when you sit down to write that last essay or exam before going home, you can say with confidence “I willed to be here. I’m free. I exist.”"},{"title":"Accounts need a sitter","url":"/story/2008-01-22/editorials/accounts-need-sitter/","date":"January 22, 2008","content":"On March 16, 2005 the AMS Board of Directors cancelled the After-Hours Childcare (AHC) service that had been in operation since 1995. The service provided weekend and weeknight childcare. It was decided that the money collected from the AHC’s $1 opt-outable fee would go to either the Ban Righ Centre or Queen’s Day Care, but neither service ever received a cheque.,The issue was forgotten until the Journal, following up on an undergraduate thesis published by Con-Ed student Andréa Stanger, approached AMS Controller Scott Bell who found the transfer had indeed never taken place. AMS Vice-President (Operations) John Manning gave the money—$7,797 plus accrued interest for a total $8,422—to Ban Righ Centre Director Barb Schlafer Friday.,AMS President Kingsley Chak pointed to previous executives as being responsible, saying it was an “oversight” on the AMS’s behalf.,It’s unfortunate the service was cancelled in the first place—although student parents are a minority on campus, they’re entitled to AMS representation. If students were still willing to pay the service’s opt-outable fee, this demonstrates a clear support for the program within the Queen’s community.,A supplementary program was proposed that would allow parents needing childcare to apply for aid but this never materialized, leaving few options for student parents.,Excusing the mistake as an “oversight” is convenient for a student government that changes every year. Accountability’s hard to come by when those responsible for last year’s management have graduated, making it easier for the current executive to shift the blame elsewhere.,But by taking on the role of leading the student body, the AMS executive needs to accept responsibility for its predecessors—even if it means cleaning up a mess that isn’t theirs.,That no one in the AMS was aware the transfer had yet to occur is even more alarming. It emphasizes the benefits of having permanent staff members to ensure accountability, although it’s worth noting even the AMS’s permanent staff didn’t notice the discrepancy for two and a half years.,If our student government is struggling to keep track of one account—whether it contains $100, $7,797 or $8 million—they’re seriously jeopardizing the confidence of the student body it exists to represent. Not only will money be lost with such haphazard accounting practices, but it’s difficult to ask for the voluntary financial support of a student body that can’t be sure its money is reaching the advertised destination.,The only way for the AMS to be a truly representative body is if its promises are fulfilled and students are assured their needs are being met. Dismissing such a blunder as an “oversight” is irresponsible and hardly works to restore confidence in an already-skeptical student body."},{"title":"RCMP weapon abuse stunning","url":"/story/2007-11-23/editorials/rcmp-weapon-abuse-stunning/","date":"November 23, 2007","content":"A video released Nov. 14 gave disturbing insight into the case of a 40-year-old Polish immigrant tasered by police at Vancouver International Airport. He was there to meet his mother, who was already living in Canada. Robert Dziekanski waited in the secure baggage area for 10 hours as his mother searched for him elsewhere.,Minutes after arriving on the scene RCMP officers tasered the man who then dropped to the floor writhing in anguish. Dziekanski shortly after. A 15-year-old Victoria resident recorded the incident on his cell phone. The video has since been posted on the Internet and viewed widely.,The events involving Dzienkanski’s last hours bring into question both the appropriateness of the officers’ reactions and the lethal possibilities of Taser use.,The National Use-of-Force Framework, stipulates that intermediate weapons—such as a Taser—are only to be used on subjects who have become “assaultive.” Dzienkanski’s behaviour may have been erratic but it was far from assaultive.,Police on the scene clearly didn’t properly assess the situation—a dangerous negligence when holding a potentially deadly weapon. Instead of an attempt to negotiate with the man, or wait for a translator, there was a swift move by the RCMP to subdue Dzienkanski however they could.,Taser use in general warrants debate. At least 18 Canadians have died after being tasered since forces began using them in 1999 and Dzienkanski’s case demonstrates that misuse of the weapon can be deadly. It’s alarming their use is so widespread among Canadian law-enforcement agencies—including their presence at Homecoming. More recently, Kingston police asked for an increase in budget in order to purchase more Tasers.,Several inquiries have been launched into the events surrounding Dzienkanski’s death. Federal Minister of Public Safety Stockwell Day is expected to release his commission’s first report this week. The B.C. Attorney-General has also announced plans to investigate the matter and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police plan to review stun gun use.,These probes are essential to righting the wrong the RCMP officers committed by using a Taser in this situation, but will only be worthwhile if the outcome brings real change and accountability for all parties involved.,The keenness of police to use Tasers is alarming, and warrants real investigation. Tasers can kill people and their misuse necessitates a reassessment of who is using them and when. Dzienkanski posed no imminent harm, but his new life in Canada ended before he even left the airport."},{"title":"Students tuning out CFRC","url":"/story/2007-11-16/editorials/students-tuning-out-cfrc/","date":"November 16, 2007","content":"Last week’s fall referendum saw all proposals passed except one—the increase of CFRC’s mandatory fee from $3.75 to $6.50. CFRC is Canada’s oldest continuously broadcasting station but its funding is low compared to the $10 national average for campus stations, says AMS Media Services Director Gillian Wheatley. CFRC’s budget took a hit two years ago when it became an AMS service and lost the University’s annual grant of $48,000.,CFRC is budgeted to post a $25,000 loss this year, although a repeat of their annual funding drive—which raked in $16,000 last year—may help.,Since its inaugural broadcast in 1923, CFRC has been a valuable institution linking the Queen’s and Kingston communities—one of few filling that role. It’s disheartening to see such a creative aspect of campus goings-on be effectively written off by its stakeholders. The responsibility for preserving CFRC falls to us as students, and the referendum’s results are a sad indication of where so many of our priorities lie.,The root cause of this apathy could be a number of things—it’s possible CFRC didn’t do enough to promote the station in the weeks leading up to the referendum. If students don’t know what the station does or that it even exists, they have no inclination to voice their support by marking off the “yes” box. At the same time, the station’s tight budget creates a cyclical effect because they lack the money to launch a campaign that would win them the financial support they need.,CFRC’s technological efforts—including internet archives and downloadable podcasts—are definitely steps in the right direction and will help to expand their audience. For those who feel all they’ve ever heard is alt/indie rock, archives and podcasts of the station’s diverse programming will revitalize the stations’s content and will strengthen its presence on and off campus.,If CRFC wants to garner increased support—and funding—from students, they need not just to be heard, but seen. Playing the channel in the QP or Common Ground would undoubtedly get people listening. But attempting to promote and educate students on CFRC only when advocating a fee increase isn’t going to excite anyone. CFRC needs to market itself if the Queen’s community is going to realize what they’re tuning out on."},{"title":"Punditry in primaries","url":"/story/2008-01-11/editorials/punditry-primaries/","date":"January 11, 2008","content":"The U.S. presidential race has barely begun, but it has already devolved into a dizzying roller-coaster ride of predictions and punditry.,No sooner had Barack Obama emerged victorious in the first Democratic caucus in Iowa Jan. 3—with his opponent, the formerly “inevitable” Hillary Clinton, a distant third—than analysts and media sources across North America and the world trumpeted Obama’s newfound momentum, Clinton’s struggle to regain her foothold in the race and what the prospect of electing the first black president would mean for the U.S.,According to many, Obama’s victory at this caucus signaled the failure of Clinton’s campaign up to that point, and the rejection of any platforms but that of change—a major component of Obama’s platform and his mantra, “Change we can believe in.”,In a matter of hours, “change” became the rallying cry of everyone involved with, or commenting on, the presidential race. All candidates, from Clinton to Republicans Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee to Obama himself, could talk of little else.,“Talk of change and disenchantment with Washington has in recent days supplanted, or at least supplemented, all the talk of experience, national security and the war in Iraq that has marked the campaign until now,” the New York Times reported Tuesday.,“Voters weighed change versus experience, and change won,” the National Business Review opined that same day.,There’s little doubt this presidential campaign has so far indicated a desire among Americans for the 2009 White House to distance itself from George W. Bush’s administration and, by association, anything related to the status quo.,But the rhetoric surrounding a push for change—coupled with competing predictions from analysts based on everything from Obama’s ethnicity to Clinton’s sex to the celebrities endorsing Mike Huckabee and Rudy Giuliani—makes it almost impossible to evaluate the content of the candidates’ platforms.,No matter what drove the plurality of Iowan Democratic and Republican voters to support Obama and Huckabee, Iowa is only one of 50 states. It has no power to determine the end results of an election unless voters in the 49 other states decide to take their cue from this caucus.,This seemed plausible as headlines trumpeting Obama’s Iowa victory seemed to fulfill their own prophecies, giving him a double-digit lead over Clinton in early New Hampshire polls.,But Clinton squeaked to a victory Tuesday night, leaving Obama in second place. Far from justifying headlines hastily giving a second Clinton the title “Comeback Kid,” the New Hampshire primary proved one constant of political campaigns that all the “desire for change” in the world can’t alter: it ain’t over ’til it’s over."},{"title":"Clark plan low on reality","url":"/story/2008-01-15/editorials/clark-plan-low-reality/","date":"January 15, 2008","content":"On Dec. 15 Engineering Society Vice-President (Operations) Rob Macnamara released his report on how to improve Clark Hall Pub and EngSoc. Unfortunately, it lacked concrete suggestions as to how to get the pub open, first.,The report is divided into five sections: Clark Hall Pub recommendations, safety and security, accountability, permanent staffing and EngSoc’s potential incorporation. Addressing each of those issues is crucial to EngSoc services’ functionality. Macnamara is right to recommend sound business practices such as standardizing training and implementing staff contracts. But many of his recommendations come with a hefty price tag that the report effectively admits EngSoc can’t afford without increasing its student fee or pursuing “other revenue sources.”,The report states EngSoc would need $210,000 annually to implement the recommendations Macnamara proposes. The report also points out EngSoc’s annual cash flow is $150,000. Although some of Macnamara’s recommendations are sound, they’re far from feasible and his report gives little to no clear explanation as to where EngSoc is going to get the money. Macnamara’s suggestion to hire two permanent staff members—a business affairs manager and a bookkeeper—is a good one. EngSoc needs permanent staff members to ensure proper accounting practices are being upheld. Despite the AMS’s occasionally limiting and frustrating bureaucracy, following in its footsteps in this regard is wise: the AMS has a permanent staffing system that works.,But much of the report seems like a euphemistic attempt to conceal Clark’s disastrous state, and bring a glossy “re-envisioning Clark’s marketing scheme” attitude to the forefront. This is evident in its focus on purchasing items such as a new mix table and re-painting the pub.,Closing the pub may have been the right thing to do in the face of mismanagement that endangered the University’s liquor licence. But refusing to make the pub’s financial records and chartered accountants Collins Barrow’s report public, EngSoc makes it seem suspiciously like they’re hiding behind a hasty, groundless closure decision. EngSoc owes the pub’s staff an apology for firing them via e-mail and being unresponsive and inconsiderate after the fact.,They owe the student body an apology for the pub’s sorry financial and operational state and for denying them the whole truth.,If Rob Macnamara and the rest of the EngSoc executive think a new coat of paint can fix Clark’s financial woes, they’re in for a rude awakening."},{"title":"Racism in broad daylight","url":"/story/2007-11-29/editorials/racism-in-daylight/","date":"November 29, 2007","content":"Last week, a female Queen’s professor reported being assaulted on campus by four male students wearing engineering jackets. The incident occurred on Nov. 14 when the woman was forced off the sidewalk by the students who taunted her with racial slurs. Principal Karen Hitchcock and the five vice-principals released a statement Nov. 21 condemning the students’ actions and asserting plans to “use all judicial and administrative means at our disposal” to deal with the issue. Hitchcock sent an e-mail to all students Nov. 28 encouraging discussions of the incident.,The 2006 release of the Henry report—which looked at systematic racism towards Queen’s faculty—demonstrates thisincident as part of a greater, recurring issue at the University. The report found Queen’s struggled to hire faculty members from Aboriginal or ethnic backgrounds.,It’s crucial to realize this is not only an abuse of an authority figure on campus but an utter lack of respect between human beings. Whether on a campus or a city street, this isn’t remotely acceptable.,The incident’s occurrence in broad daylight and in the centre of campus makes it that much more disturbing. It’s appalling other students would allow this to take place without intervening. Unfortunately, the shock such an incident should elicit is subdued by the racist atmosphere that—to a degree—has come to characterize Queen’s. Our campus is far from diverse and often even further from accepting or tolerant. Racially assaulting a professor is not only a crime but an embarrassment to the school.,The title of “Queen’s student” is one we all share and although it’s easy to point to the small number involved in the incident, their actions embody a mindset of entitlement of many Queen’s students. The University’s statement calling for progress and punitive measures will be brushed off as mere rhetoric unless more concrete action is taken soon. Principal Hitchcock’s intentions to create forums for discussion on campus get to the point but the outcome needs to be more than collective condemnation. Impressive as it is that the professor came forward, her voice will be muted if Queen’s administrators don’t take a blunt and forceful stand on the issue. The University needs to be proactive instead of reactionary when dealing with racism on campus. There needs to be a visible outcome to anti-racism campaigns.,The AMS—which has yet to make a formal statement regarding the incident—needs to address the prevalence of racism in the student body and actively work to eliminate it. Students need to realize such prevalent racism affects them and their education and indifference towards it is not an option.

O’Keefe was on his way home shortly after 1 a.m. when he was struck by a stray bullet allegedly intended for a bouncer at the Brass Rail Tavern. The bouncer had asked the gunman and his friend to leave shortly before one of them opened fire outside the tavern.,Although the handgun was legally registered, it has sparked national debate on whether the weapons should be outlawed. On Monday, Toronto city councillor Michael Walker motioned for the prohibition of handguns and received support from Toronto mayor David Miller.,Gun violence isn’t a new issue in Toronto, nor is the concern of legalized firearms new to the national agenda. Just over a year ago, 15-year-old Jane Creba was shot and killed only blocks from where O’Keefe was shot—frightening given this is on Toronto’s busiest street.,Dozens of homicides in Toronto each year have often generated debate as to whether tighter gun control is necessary, but this rhetoric has rarely materialized into a substantial plan of action.,Eliminating handguns is a good but implausible idea.,Should the proposal to ban the weapons pass, it’s impossible to ensure the handguns would disappear from the homes of the thousands of Canadians who have them legally registered. Contraband guns would find their way into the country.,Walker’s proposal to push for a ban is one of many steps necessary to reduce gun violence. If the motion is to be taken as more than a cosmetic solution, it’s vital for ongoing projects to confront the roots of the violence itself, whether it be poverty or systemic discrimination. Similarly, the issue needs to stay visible in the news rather than fade from headlines as interest and political sympathy begin to wane.,The federal government needs to come through on its tough-on-crime stance by decreasing the number of weapons—registered or not—on the street.

I hope it hasn’t but it’s difficult to ignore my friends when they ask, “How was Queen’s?” in a prissy tone. So, what’s the deal? Do we all think we’re academic gods and goddesses because we go to Queen’s, the so-called “Harvard of the North?” Give me a break! I don’t think that and I hope you don’t, either. This summer I was afforded the opportunity to work in downtown Toronto in an office building.,I, mistakenly, thought that the other students working in my building would also be from Queen’s. As it turned out, no one else went to Queen’s or cared that I did.,My best friend who worked with me during the summer goes to Lakehead University. I hope that didn’t make you laugh because as a fourth year student he was making close to $30 an hour. And I was making significantly less.,I don’t want to get off on the wrong foot; what I’m trying to show is that other schools, ones you may not expect, stack up to Queen’s. Sure, Queen’s is a great school with great programs but I try not to let it get to my head. I think what matters is the attitude you have and who you are.,This is exactly what I found coming out of high school. When I first moved into residence I realized there were many people from all around Canada and the world who had gone to different high schools than I did. It no longer mattered that I went to Lawrence Park, which I thought was a well-known academic public school. Most people here have never heard of it, or if they have, they could care less.,I think this will be the case when I graduate, too. I’m going to end up working with people who graduated from universities and colleges all over the world. If I’m open to the fact that anyone can be more intelligent and successful than me then I will be set for life. My ability to learn from those smarter than me will get me further ahead.,I think this is the way other students at Queen’s should think too. Without preaching too much, my main message is, don’t let Queen’s get to your head. I think it’s a nice idea to take a reality check once in a while.,Queen’s isn’t the “Harvard of the North.” And Queen’s students aren’t necessarily going to be any more successful than any other university students, especially if we’re cocky like others think we are.,Cockiness can be a limiting quality that may get your foot in the door at a good job, but not much further."},{"title":"Draft code needs clarification","url":"/story/2007-10-30/editorials/draft-code-needs-clarification/","date":"October 30, 2007","content":"Proposals to change the Queen’s Code of Conduct expand the one-page document to seven and include clauses with more explicit definitions of non-academic disobedience and its repercussions. The University unveiled its draft this summer, and is collecting feedback on it.,The code must be adhered to by every Queen’s student and stipulates acceptable student behaviour both on and off campus. The proposed changes attempt to clearly delineate what civil acts of disobedience are punishable under the code and require review by the Queen’s Judicial Committee (JComm).,The draft has come under fire from student groups who claim clauses forbidding “unauthorized conduct likely to limit the lawful rights of others to possess, use, or enjoy private or University property” and “disorderly or disruptive conduct that interferes with the lawful activity of others” would infringe on students’ rights. Specifically, the group’s website, which has dubbed the draft code the Queen’s “Patriot Act,” claims these clauses would “criminalize acts of civil disobedience at Queen’s.”,It’s commendable that students are taking an active role by speaking out regarding a document that affects them directly. It’s regrettable, however, that this protest is so poorly informed: the University has no power to “criminalize” anything, and Canadian citizens have no “right” to civil disobedience—the terms itself implies its contravention of the law.,What is problematic about the draft code, however, is its vagueness: it’s not clear when these clauses are in effect. The draft states only that they apply “to all conduct by a student that has a rational and substantive connection to the University, University activities, the University community, or University-related functions, whether or not the conduct occurred on University property.” It extends its jurisdiction outside of activities strictly within the academic calendar—activities that include post-exam partying and international exchanges. Misbehaving former students can even have their degrees rescinded.Clarification is needed as to exactly what circumstances the code applies.,Thorough understanding of the code’s draft is crucial to taking a stance on it. At the same time, it’s difficult to fully grasp its terms when so many of its clauses are ambiguous. The code’s drafters should clarify their terms of agreement and ensure they’re applied consistently."},{"title":"City can’t cop out on police bill","url":"/story/2007-11-02/editorials/city-cant-cop-out-police-bill/","date":"November 2, 2007","content":"On Oct. 16, city councillors voted by a margin of 11 to two in favour of asking Queen’s to cover the policing costs of Homecoming 2007. The bill is estimated to be as high as $353,000, including the police costs from the Ontario Provincial Police public order unit, the Toronto public order unit and the Kingston police.,Although the Aberdeen Street party isn’t a University-sanctioned event, the city feels Queen’s has a duty to pay and the money should be detracted from the thousands of dollars that Queen’s “rakes in,” according to councillor Steve Garrison. Garrison suggested that by refusing to foot the bill, Queen’s is harming the fragile relationship between Kingston and the University.,Considering the ridiculousness of the city’s appeal, the Queen’s administration has so far handled the situation reasonably—the University hasn’t rejected the option of covering some costs, but has said the council’s decision is merely a statement of opinion rather than a coercive measure. It’s encouraging that Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane has made it clear he thinks the city is making an unreasonable request.,Last year, Queen’s gave the city $100,000 prior to Homecoming to cover costs as a goodwill gesture, after approaching the city to discuss costs. One year later, the city is taking a more hard-line approach by effectively handing the University a $300,000 bill. It’s clear that with departmental budget cuts and construction costs, Queen’s isn’t looking for new and unnecessary places to spend money.,The fact is a significant number of those Aberdeen partiers weren’t Queen’s students and were equally responsible for any incurred costs—a matter city council seems to have conveniently ignored. In addition, it’s unjustifiable to ask Queen’s students, many of whom weren’t involved in any Homecoming events, to pick up a tab they weren’t there to run up.,Most disconcerting are the implications of such a request. By appealing to Queen’s to cover the bill, the city insinuates students—as residents and taxpayers—aren’t owed the same service the police must give to every other Kingston resident. Council’s demand for cash only fuels the Council’s ongoing “us-versus-them” mentality that has infiltrated Kingston-student relations."},{"title":"Muted protest to power grab in Pakistan","url":"/story/2007-11-09/editorials/muted-protest-power-grab-pakistan/","date":"November 9, 2007","content":"Hopes of democratic progress in Pakistan were dashed last week when President Pervez Musharraf—who is also the leader of the country’s military—suspended the country’s constitution and declared a state of emergency. The country has faced significant turmoil in the last month following the return of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who had been exiled in Dubai but had pledged to run in the election slated for this January.,The government has suspended all privately run television channels and cut telephone lines in the capital city of Islamabad. The Supreme Court justices—who had been set to make a decision as to the legitimacy of Musharraf’s Oct. 6 presidential election win—were made to swear a new oath to the president, while the chief justice was replaced by a someone faithful to Musharraf.,The volatile situation in Pakistan is frightening. With the elections set for January and the candidacy of pro-democracy Bhutto, the country had been heading down a road that would have led to expanded civil rights and perhaps abolished the rigid militaristic regime Musharraf instated after taking power in a coup eight years ago.,Although Pakistan’s future is now uncertain, the blatant abrogation of rights couldn’t be more clear. Fundamental freedoms such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press have not just been violated—they have been discarded entirely.,Equally frightening is the reaction from Western governments. George W. Bush has counted Pakistan as one of the U.S.’s allies in the “war on terror,” but he must have found himself in hot water when Musharraf stripped his citizens of civil rights and began tear-gassing and detaining hundreds of protesting lawyers. The White House’s response was initially muted and its rhetoric seemed to prioritize the war on terror over the preservation of rights and freedoms. Bush seems unashamedly ready to stand by Musharraf’s police state rather than risk losing that strategic partnership.,Musharraf’s actions should also make us wary of our own government’s abrogation of rights in the name of fighting terror and maintaining security.,Either way, it’s imperative Canada as a country condemns Musharraf’s naked power grab and his systematic disregard for democratic values in order to uphold human rights and freedoms in Pakistan and elsewhere."},{"title":"Vote on OUSA?

The AMS has advocated the importance of participation in the alliance, claiming that leaving OUSA will hinder Queen’s students’ ability to lobby for change.,Another hindrance the AMS has so far neglected is that a discouraging number of students have no idea what OUSA is—when discussing its relevance in a Journal editorial board meeting, few of those present knew what OUSA was, let alone what it was for. The AMS has a lot of catching up to do to educate Queen’s population on OUSA’s mandate and why our money is a necessary contribution.,OUSA hasn’t provided much in terms of visible results in recent years, leaving room for other options to be explored. One noteworthy alternative to OUSA is the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), which has similar goals but often employs more aggressive tactics to achieve them. CFS lobbies to both the provincial and federal governments, so the AMS could technically be a member of both groups.,CFS’s predominant appeal is its numbers—86 student unions compared to OUSA’s seven. If those numbers indicate swaying power, CFS comparably has the ability to get things done. CFS tactics might be too radical for Queen’s, although it’s telling that AMS vice-president (University Affairs) Julia Mitchell said OUSA’s ineffectual reports are more in keeping with AMS “values.”,Membership in CFS has the potential, too, to polarize its members because of its somewhat antagonistic methods. Although bolder statements can garner attention, too much aggression would only isolate CFS members from its lobbyist targets.,Ideally, the AMS would have the option of actively participating in a group that ideologically represents a median between OUSA and CFS, and made recommendations through both policy suggestions and placid demonstrations. Whomever the AMS allies itself with, however, it’s vital our student government takes an active role and keeps students informed as to what’s going on."},{"title":"Safe-sex measures arouse debate","url":"/story/2007-10-23/editorials/safe-sex-measures-arouse-debate/","date":"October 23, 2007","content":"Hundreds of Queen’s students are getting vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV), but the parents of many Grade 8 girls, the provincial government’s target population, aren’t so sure. The vaccine has caused a stir in recent months as provincial governments such as Ontario have announced universal immunization programs. Although its long-term effects are unknown, it’s obvious that the vaccine’s short-term effects include public outcries against its social implications. Some have protested Gardasil’s young target population, saying that’s too young to get a vaccine that protects against STDs.,Safer-sex initiatives are getting a similar reception south of the border. Recently a middle school in Portland, Maine began offering prescription contraception at its in-school health clinic. The state’s condemnation of the policy has been echoed by the school’s committee chair as well as Portland’s Republican Party chairman.,Public reactions to both the HPV program and the middle school’s contraceptives reflect a skewed perception of sexual activity. It seems many people espouse the absurd notion that support for sexual health programs implicitly endorses having sex at a young age.,Any claims that such implementations encourage young people to have promiscuous sex are ridiculous and unfounded. MOre than one quarter of schools in the U.S. offer condoms as a readily available contraceptive, but condoms aren’t necessarily enough. Getting a shot to protect against an STD doesn’t encourage kids to jump into bed—it tells them there are adverse risks involved, and avoiding them involves precautionary measures.,These kids are having sex. It’s important, then, that they have resources to ensure their health and safety and don’t face condemnation for accessing them.,In Canada, the source of credible debate regarding the HPV vaccine has stemmed largely from its implementation method. It’s not the government endorsement that has roused controversy so much as it is the discrepancies between each province as to who receives the vaccine, and how. Ontario is providing the shot to all Grade 8 girls, some provinces plan to do the same in 2008 and the Alberta government still isn’t sure what its plans are. There’s very little synchronization on a health issue that affects all Canadians.,The contention arising from the mere mention of teenage sexuality demonstrates the inaccurate assumptions people make about the implications of promoting safe sex. Whether or not it’s government sponsored, teens who may be sexually active need protection against diseases and unwanted pregnancy. What they don’t need are the mixed messages and disapproval that comes with this controversy."},{"title":"Eat. Sleep.

Now to be fair, I’m no longer playing that old bible sized gray box with purple buttons, a green screen and four AA batteries, but a new evolved incarnation called a Nintendo DS—a PDA-sized, dual screen, sleek white device that displays more pixels than most TVs and more colours than a rainbow. As I was playing for minutes, which turned to hours, I wondered how long video games have played a role as entertainment in my life. How much money is spent on Nintendos, Playstations, cartridges, discs and controllers, and more importantly, how many other people are just like me?,The video game industry has transformed from the expensive niche culture of the early ’80s with characters like Ms. PacMan to a multi-billion dollar mainstream industry of Link and Master Chief—an industry that controls a decent amount of the entertainment sector of today’s society. Whether it be fantasy, science fiction, action, simulation or sport simulation, video games have found a way to invade every aspect of our imagination, digitize it and then sell it back to us for a nifty price of at least $50, and that’s just the games. Let’s not forget the huge expense of consoles starting at $300.,The industry is pure money-making genius, and we’re clearly hooked on it: millions of people worldwide wait in lines outside stores to be the first to get Halo 3, or the new Nintendo Wii.  I personally have gone through the agony of waiting in line for the Nintendo Wii, only to be rejected as the person in front of me got the last console in the store.,What drives us to spend hours of our time and money on these digital incarnations of our imagination? Is it purely visual entertainment? How do we derive emotional satisfaction from grabbing all the coins or saving the world of Warcraft? After all, what we accomplish with our digital avatars has no real bearing on the real world, except for maybe an expanding waistline or a widening hole in our wallets.,What I do know is that, at the end of the day, I’m still wondering if I have what it takes to find all the gems and heart containers, how cool the final boss will look like, and whether the in-game ending was worth all those hours.

Most of us don’t think a lot about where our stuff goes on recycling day, and that’s fine. If recycling has penetrated our collective psyche enough that we no longer question its importance, that’s amazing.,The only problem is, in the consumer world, we have a long way to go. Drink companies have worked their way through the deposit system, and computer companies are exploring trade-ins for what’s being called e-waste. Even dairy products come in plastic containers that can be reused. And all that’s great; but what about the companies that make cleaning products?,I’m not sure exactly when I first saw a commercial for Swiffer, but I’m pretty sure I wondered what the big deal was. To be honest, I thought it was a fad that was going to die off.,However, instead of going away, it took over almost every aspect of what cleaning now means. Instead of using a broom, we use disposable cloths—ditto for mopping. There’s even a disposable toilet brush attachment and companies are promoting disposable wipes for counters. Paper towels are even being marketed as a disposable dishcloth.,Seriously, what has happened to us? In one half of our mentality, we buy products with recyclable packaging, support eco-friendly manufacturers, and put our recycling on the curb once a week. In the other half, we’re seduced by the word “disposable.”,Don’t kid yourself—these products aren’t very good for our landfills or our waterways. Even paper towel, which will at least biodegrade, has been bleached and treated with chemicals.,Even on an economical level, how is buying Swiffer refills every few weeks cheaper than buying one broom, once? Why use disposable dishcloths when you could buy a nice cloth one that you put in the wash once a week?,We profess to be a generation who are fighting global warming, so why are we letting manufacturers get away with this? Consumers have the power to dictate what gets produced and what sells, and if we’re serious about changing our environmental future, we’re going to have to raise our voices.,There are plenty of competitively priced, environmentally friendly cleaning products out there. It may seem more expensive to buy a few tea towels and a package of washcloths, but compared to your monthly expenditure on paper towel and disinfectant wipes, you would be saving a bundle.,In fact, not only would you be keeping a little more money in your pocket, you would be backing up your weekly walk to the curb by rocking the first of those all important Rs: reduce."},{"title":"Don’t sweat the small stuff","url":"/story/2007-11-02/editorials/dont-sweat-small-stuff/","date":"November 2, 2007","content":"Stay in school as long as you can!,Seriously, if Billy Madison said it, it must be true.

The rankings divide universities based on their size. Included in the report are stories on relevant issues to post-secondary education such as the role of technology and whether leaving home to go to school is the right decision.,The rankings can come in especially handy for prospective students on the other side of the country—or the world—who aren’t able to visit the schools. In those cases, the Globe’s rundown is a useful tool for determining who’s best at serving an array of interests.,Comparative reports, such as the Globe’s, are useful because they lay out all the necessary information in easy-to-read graphs and charts. The numbers present an aggregate opinion of each school’s student bodies, so prospective students know the results are from the perspective of your peers—not that school’s glossy viewbook.,The survey takes an in-depth look at facets of the universities, ranking a total of 76 bases of comparison, which include life both on and off campus. Providing such an extensive list allows applicants to pick and choose what matters to them most, and make their decision knowing they’re well-informed in all areas of importance.,There are, however, limitations to using this system as the sole resource for selecting a school. Ultimately, grades and marks can only tell you so much about a school, and anyone making a decision based solely on surveys like this is doing so at their peril. These surveys present a valuable tool for students making all-important and often confusing decisions.

Please don’t burn me with Miller,” Daly wrote in the e-mail.,Miller later defended his actions to the Globe and Mail’s William Houston, saying he intended the information solely for Daly, and was only trying to use it to get him to talk.,“My job is to report the news, and one of the most effective things is, if you have information, give it to someone and he might give you some back,” he said.,Miller made some errors here. He made the mistake of giving perhaps too much information to an untrustworthy source in hopes of sparking a comment. In addition, it’s not clear if the information he had should have been published or not, which may bring legal issues into the discussion.,However, as Houston pointed out, sometimes it’s necessary to give out information in the hopes of getting some back. The history of investigative reporting is filled with examples where it has worked, going all the way back to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s conversations with “Deep Throat” that helped expose the Watergate affair and end Richard Nixon’s presidency.,The real villain here isn’t Gord Miller, but Bill Daly. It’s bizarre that a key figure running a professional sports league would work together with his supposedly sworn enemy at the players’ union against the media. In a normal situation, these should be the last two people on earth to team up.,For some reason, sports executives seem to feel they have the right to do whatever they like to the press. A classic example is from last May, when Toronto Blue Jays’ general manager J.P. Ricciardi lied to the media about an injury to closer B.J. Ryan. Ricciardi originally said Ryan had back problems, but it later came out that Ryan had an elbow injury. When asked about the inconsistency, Ricciardi said, “They’re not lies if we know the truth.” Another example is the famous video clip of John Tortorella, coach of the Tampa Bay Lighting, swearing at a reporter and kicking him out of a press conference for asking a question he didn’t like.,Media of one form or another provide the best method of alerting fans to developments in the sporting world, but they can’t do that if they aren’t taken seriously.

If used improperly, this material can have potentially lethal effects. It’s estimated that up to 90,000 people die each year from exposure to asbestos. Even with these statistics, the Quebec and federal governments continue to actively promote asbestos as a viable import to developing states.,There’s really no justification for the Canadian government’s ongoing promotion of their deadly export. Defenders of the state-sponsored industry cite its $93-million dollar revenue as one reason to uphold its production—an unsound argument especially for a federal government that has recorded a budgetary surplus each year for the last decade.,This assertion makes the government look like it has one thing in mind—money—and will employ unjust means to achieve it. The profit-incentive nature of the operation is alarming, and Canada is guilty of aiding companies in danger of closing if a global anti-asbestos policy were to be implemented. Luckily for Canada, it succeeded in voting down such a policy when the U.N. tried to implement it.,Quebec and the Department of Natural Resources defend the program on the basis that asbestos is harmless to countries purchasing it as long as they use it cautiously, implying Canada can’t be held accountable if they don’t. It’s unrealistic to assume that these countries have the infrastructure necessary to ensure its effects are harmless, especially because it’s evident major importers such as India can’t implement adequate safety measures for workers or consumers who come in contact with asbestos.,The situation’s hypocrisy is obvious—the carcinogenic material is hardly used in Canada anymore. Yet the government has no qualms about shipping asbestos to countries they can’t guarantee are using the requisite “controlled-use approach.” If the measures necessary to ensure its safe usage aren’t considered worth the effort in our own country, what indicates that less developed countries would be inclined to employ them, either?,It’s within the Quebec and federal government’s capacity to reasonably foresee the damaging effects that asbestos may have in the import countries. The fact that they’re not only allowing its extraction to continue, but spending tens of millions of dollars over the last two decades to promote it isn’t just deplorable—it’s downright immoral."},{"title":"Battlestar vs. religion","url":"/story/2007-10-23/editorials/battlestar-vs-religion/","date":"October 23, 2007","content":"\"Believe in one true god and … don’t worship false idols.”,No, this phrase is actually from a science-fiction television show. Battlestar Galactica (BSG) follows the last of the human race as they try to escape the Cylons (fanatical robots with a grudge) and find a new planet on which to settle down. However, as you enter the second season, the religious undertone starts to become much more obvious.,In the show the Cylons believe in one true god, whereas the human race believes in many gods; their deities usually named after the ancient Greek and Roman gods. The show’s producers intended this to be a twist in the storyline as the villain is usually the one who is polytheistic.,The end of season two can remind one much of the crusades, as the Cylons follow mankind to a desolate planet and then proceed to occupy it, “employing any means necessary to bring the word of God to the people.” But this article isn’t about the religious undertones of this promising television series; it’s more about the response—or lack there,of—of the viewers who have watched these undertones unfold.,Religious protests have always been present in our society. Whether it’s because a Danish newspaper published a cartoon representing the prophet, Muhammad, with a bomb as a turban the way Jews were represented in The Passion of the Christ. People tend to view certain religious issues too radically, even when there’s no real need for the issue to be taken that seriously.,For example, the production of Monty Python’s Life of Brian was banned in several countries because of the way they portrayed certain biblical signs. Life of Brian is a comedy film, not meant to be taken seriously, and yet it was banned in Italy for 11 years. People protest against movies that have subtle blasphemous ideas and messages, and yet in a prominent science-fiction television series, where they nearly literally quote the Bible every other episode, no one says a thing.,A census conducted in 2005 by Encyclopedia Britannica showed that 53.57% of the world’s population believes in Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism). Battlestar Galactica is shown almost worldwide, not to mention that it’s a remake of a cult classic, ensuring that its viewer demographic spans generations.,How come, when the public can so easily protest a comedy film, no one mentions anything about the obvious anti-Abrahamic messaging? Where do we draw the line between what we can validly protest against and what we can let go as being fictitious enough? The “Islamic” cartoon produced in Denmark only had a small audience and yet all imports from Denmark were banned in Arabic countries.,\tThe intent of this article is not to start a protest against BSG. It is meant to open people’s eyes to how we can abuse our right to free speech. Protesting against media to defend your religion is not wrong, but why aren’t we consistent? Why does one anti-religious media get years of protests, while another gets no attention at all. Is this fair? What’s the real reason BSG gets no attention, while Life of Brian does?"},{"title":"The camera loves RCMP officers","url":"/story/2007-10-16/editorials/camera-loves-rcmp-officers/","date":"October 16, 2007","content":"This past Canada Day a group of 20 or so young party-goers were waiting at a University of British Columbia bus stop when a police car approached the group of youths, some of whom were holding open alcohol containers. The seemingly standard interaction soon became headline-worthy as the cops posed for photos with several young women in suggestive photos recently sent to the school’s newspaper, The Ubyssey.,The girls smiled coyly for the camera, wearing handcuffs in some photos and sitting in the back of the squad car in others; some of the pictures also showed them posing with the officers who appeared to be happily obliging. During the incident a young man in the group voiced his concern about the officers’ professionalism at which point they told him to dump out his drink, then continued the picture taking.,It’s hard to determine what exactly gave the RCMP officers the impression their behaviour was appropriate and conducive to them performing their job. The repercussions for such careless actions affect not only themselves but also the reputation of the RCMP and police forces across Canada.,Police officers are expected to enforce the law and ensure such blatant abuses of power are either prevented or dealt with accordingly. It’s disconcerting to know the officials to whom you would turn in, say, a case of sexual assault are using—and abusing—their authority to propagate sexual innuendo with people your own age that, given this power relationship, is downright creepy.,It’s difficult to achieve a proper balance in civilian-police interactions: while ideally cops should be friendly and approachable, the other end of the spectrum creates a problem of indecency exhibited in the UBC case.,This past weekend at Queen’s, as police infiltrated every nook and cranny of the Ghetto, there weren’t obvious exploitations of power, although some flirting occurred in successful attempts to get out of tickets. The cops were generally approachable and professional.,Nonetheless, that the UBC incident happened on campus and under such ordinary circumstances is unsettling.

Canadian Studies offers only two courses: The Canadian Nation, Real and/or Imagined (CDNS200) and CanadianHumour (CDNS401). The former is a full-credit compulsory course; the latter is a half-credit, non-compulsory course.,Although the department has aspirations to expand, the reduced budget presents a huge obstacle. The cuts won’t just prevent the department from growing, they will shrink it further.,Almost paradoxically, the school touts Canadian Studies as being a department integral to the Queen’s curriculum while at the same time asserting it’s a small enough program that slicing its budget nearly in half will go relatively unnoticed.,There’s also the notion that the department’s enrolment is low because so few students care to learn about Canadian issues. Their indifference, however, is only fueled by the lack of enthusiasm Queen’s exhibits for the Canadian Studies programs. How can students express their interest when their course options are a grand total of one class?,It’s a sad truth that the cuts are somewhat indicative of the value we place on knowledge of Canada’s history; it’s even more discouraging that it demonstrates the priority we give to bigger departments here at Queen’s, often at the expense of smaller ones. Granted, the University can’t be blamed for trying to balance the books, which understandably necessitates some redistribution. Criticism is due, however, when there is little to no consultation as to where the needed funds are taken from.,A less detrimental route would have been for Queen’s to choose larger departments that perhaps wouldn’t have felt such an impact if hit with budget cuts. Although other departments face smaller budgets, larger faculties such as Political Studies or Economics may not have had to make the same drastic adaptations. Through minimal percentage cuts to several of the big departments, $14,000 could have accumulated with fewer consequences.,The lack of communication with students shows that the University hardly values the program as much as it professes. Budget cuts are an unfortunate reality of avoiding financial woes, but they can’t just be swallowed if their allocations are so visibly disproportionate."},{"title":"Scoring top athletes not main goal","url":"/story/2007-11-09/editorials/scoring-top-athletes-not-main-goal/","date":"November 9, 2007","content":"One provision of the Athletics and Recreation Review, released in July, calls for early pre-registration for student-athletes. Chair of Athletics and Recreation Leslie Dal Cin said the change would give flexibility to students trying to juggle team commitments and academics.,A second recommendation proposed student-athletes be offered letters of admission earlier in the year. Queen’s is currently one of the last Canadian schools to offer acceptance letters and consequently loses promising athletes to other universities, Dal Cin said.,Athletes should be recognized as being assets to the school—their extracurricular contributions are substantial and often come at the expense of their free time and sometimes their academics. The assertion that student-athletes give more to athletics than other students give their extracurriculars—a notion that seems embedded in the proposed changes—is a contentious one. Many would argue that, if the proposals are put in place, athletes would be privileged over other students that donate as much time and commitment to Queen’s.,Athletes aren’t the only ones challenged with balancing school with outside activities. Separating athletes from the rest of the student body creates a social and academic stratification that isn’t justifiable or necessary.,If athletics and academics are butting heads, as the review alleges, perhaps the school should consider solutions that would enhance our academic capacity, such as expanding the course calendar. If the already limited courses aren’t in ideal time-slots for them to choose from in the first place, early pre-registration wouldn’t help athletes optimize their schedule.,American universities have often been accused of elevating student-athletes and lowering their entrance standards in the process. But Queen’s doesn’t place the same emphasis on athletics as our American counterparts. Sending out admissions letters earlier in the year creates inequality by putting athletes on a pedestal before they’ve even set foot on campus.,It’s undeniable that our student-athletes contribute a great deal to the Queen’s community. Their hard work and dedication is commendable, but that doesn’t mean being on a team makes you worthier than those donating time to non-athletic activities. Students come to Queen’s because they’re offered a high-quality education and the opportunity to pursue their interests and talents. Discrimination based on those interests and skills will have a polarizing effect and bring the University’s priorities into question."},{"title":"Leaving another hole in the Ghetto","url":"/story/2007-10-23/editorials/leaving-another-hole-ghetto/","date":"October 23, 2007","content":"Coffee & Company, the beloved community coffee shop at the corner of Johnson and Division streets, closed its doors for the last time this past Friday.

Their insistence on secrecy meant outside sources, including the Journal, weren’t privy to their plans except through grapevine rumours. Management rebuffed all queries regarding the closing—apparently they didn’t want to see the results that a widespread customer and support base could yield, even when plans were finalized.,By choosing not to make their closing public knowledge, Coffee & Company lost at least a few days of booming business as customers would have grabbed their last coffees, teas or lattes from the favourite community stop. Moreover, they may have lost some of their customers altogether—their tight-lipped approach just isolated their customers and discouraged them from following the shop their downtown location.,The closure is an obvious example of corporatization’s nasty effects; Coffee & Company had an admirable leg up on Starbucks in terms of its sustainability records—it made more concerted efforts to be environmentally friendly—and its homey feel. The closure is indicative of our irresponsible buying habits that prioritize consumerism whether we’re conscious of it or not.,It’s a shame Coffee & Company had to shut its doors. And it’s an even bigger shame that, in the shop’s dying days, its management chose to exclude those that had, for so long, kept the shop alive."},{"title":"The Colbert presidential report","url":"/story/2007-10-26/editorials/colbert-presidential-report/","date":"October 26, 2007","content":"Earlier this week, former Daily Show correspondent Stephen Colbert returned for an appearance on the show and announced he was considering running for U.S. President in the 2008 election.,Just 15 minutes later, he announced on his own show The Colbert Report that he would be running in the primaries in his home state of South Carolina.,Colbert has said he will run both as a Democrat and a Republican just so that he “can lose twice.” In a television interview after his announcement, the satirical political pundit clarified that he didn’t want to actually win the presidency—just run for it.,Although the initial reaction to Colbert’s announcement was the anticipation of a punchline, it never came.,It’s hard to say if Colbert will significantly shake up American politics, and to what degree. It’s undeniable that just by running he makes a statement that’s generating talk about the state of American politics and the country’s electoral system.,But one has to ask how big of a mark a comedian—albeit a political savvy, well-read one—can make on the election and American politics as a whole. Colbert’s influence has evolved to notable clout in recent years, and it’s entirely possible that his campaign could noticeably sway voters.,His attempt to subvert the American political system could resound with electorates; he will not only force people to examine the status quo, he’ll raise debates, as he always has, on issues that other politicians aren’t inclined to tackle.,It’s also possible Colbert’s candidacy could impact voter turnout. Since his show’s debut in 2005, he has gathered a large following across North America and much of that crowd is the generation of oft-apathetic youth. The downside to this possibility, however, is that his absence from the following election could further increase indifference.,It’s impossible to predict the outcome of Colbert’s campaign. It could be a farce that makes a point but has little lasting value or it could raise important issues and give American politics the shake up it needs.,Colbert’s running will definitely be a source of entertainment; whether Colbert’s pop-culture status translates into significant political impact won’t be determined until the votes are in."},{"title":"What would Don Rogers do?","url":"/story/2007-10-16/editorials/what-would-don-rogers-do/","date":"October 16, 2007","content":"This past Saturday night, I had the pleasure of spending a few hours amongst the shouting drunkards, the thrown ’bows, and the anonymous, groping fingers that make up so much of the Aberdeen crowd. Surrounded by approximately 250 Kingston, Toronto and OPP police officers, hundreds (perhaps thousands) of people openly taunted the law by drinking alcohol in public or smoking weed. And yet the general feeling then, and in much of the coverage that followed, was that something was missing.,Sure, a vehicle was flipped, says the Whig-Standard, but, “even then, it was only a 12-foot sailboat.” The heart seems to have gone out of Homecoming at Aberdeen; for me, that heart was the visibility of one Don Rogers.,For those who don’t recognize the name, Don Rogers is a former Kingston city councillor, a member of the Canadian Action Party, and the man who, at the Aberdeen Street party last year, carried a sign admonishing police to “enforce our liquor laws.” Rogers made an appearance in the Ghetto on Saturday night, sans sign, but I didn’t see him and missed last year’s zeal.,It’s easy to laugh at the impracticality of his message, but I have to sympathise with the sentiment behind it. The police on Aberdeen are put in an impossible situation: there are too many people drinking in public for them all to be written up, and there are far more pressing matters anyway. What results is a seemingly arbitrary and ineffectual enforcement of the law that is deeply corrosive to the general respect of our legal institutions.,This is the situation Canada is currently facing with regard to the prohibition against marijuana, and unlike the situation on Aberdeen Street, it’s getting worse each year. 4.5 million Canadians used marijuana in 2004, according to Statistics Canada—roughly 14 per cent of the population, and up from 3 million in 2002. The number of people involved in growing operations in B.C. alone has been estimated at over 150,000.,What effect does the criminalization of so many Canadians have for law and order in Canada? Legislatively, it has little impact, as pot smoking in this country is an open secret. Its real harm comes from the vain attempts to enforce the law, which leave many Canadians behind bars and scratching their heads. \t Though pot-smokers tend to justify their habit by claiming it’s less harmful than alcohol, its stigma pits smokers against authority by forcing them to lie. The hypocrisy of the situation is well known: how many students have lied to their parents about smoking pot, only to later discover their parents did it too?,I doubt Don Rogers will join me in the park for a glass of wine or a joint, but all the same, I’ll be toasting him and the spirit of law and order."},{"title":"Newspapers have riot over Aberdeen","url":"/story/2007-10-19/editorials/newspapers-have-riot-over-aberdeen/","date":"October 19, 2007","content":"Compared to years past, Homecoming 2007 could be labelled a success. There were fewer arrests, fewer injuries and no cars were flipped. There seemed to be an air of tension leading up to the event, and the attitude around campus seemed to be that this year could turn ugly.,But it didn’t—not really. Although it’s never a good thing when thousands of drunks crowd onto a two-block street, this year’s Aberdeen Street party was a lot better than it could have been. It’s unlikely, however, that the rest of Canada shares that perspective if they’ve been reading the country’s two biggest newspapers.,The Toronto Star didn’t have a reporter in Kingston, and sought out the Journal to provide it with its facts. The Star’s headline “Queen’s Homecoming turns violent” was only the beginning of a dramatized account of the events that claimed Aberdeen Street was swarmed in “waves of violence.” In the parts where their article isn’t focused on the party-goers’ misbehaviour, it goes straight into details of Homecoming’s “sordid” past at Queen’s.,Similarly, Queen’s Homecoming was apparently so enthralling and significant for Canadians that it landed a photo throw on the front page of the Globe and Mail, with a continuation of the story on page A3. By contrasting the numbers of arrests and partiers on Aberdeen Street Saturday night with claims the night was a success without contextualizing the history behind that assessment, the papers make those involved out to be idiots.,The Globe’s story also implied that the University sanctioned the event—their choice of interviewees, including former Vice-Principal (Advancement) George Hood and Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane, were for the most part affiliated with Queen’s. This painted a skewed picture that Queen’s was, in fact, fully responsible for the going-ons of Aberdeen Street.,The Kingston Whig-Standard’s coverage—which spanned several pages—was comparatively less dramatic.,This coverage by major newspapers seems unwarranted. It’s as though both papers had a direly slow weekend, news-wise—so much that a street party became a top story. Moreover, it seems the angle adopted by both news sources—that Homecoming was an uproarious mess of beer bottles, cops and intoxicated youths—was clearly in place before any reporting was actually done.,As Queen’s students, it’s hard to not be upset about the negative coverage our school is garnering. But it can’t be denied that all these events did indeed take place. Despite what we see as an out-of-context perspective, these papers aren’t pulling their material out of nowhere. If we’re serious about eliminating such negative press about Queen’s, it’s up to us to keep our so-called revelry from being newsworthy."},{"title":"Gore’s efforts aren’t Nobel enough","url":"/story/2007-10-16/editorials/gores-efforts-arent-nobel-enough/","date":"October 16, 2007","content":"The Nobel prizes are awarded annually in the categories of medicine, chemistry, peace, literature, physics and economics and are valued as a great honour; they represent the recognition of significant achievement in their particular fields. This week, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their contribution to environmental awareness and the anti-climate change cause.,Gore’s documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, was hailed as one of 2006’s best films and gave momentum to the global warming movement—Gore now travels worldwide lending his voice to the cause and was a key organizer of this summer’s Live Earth concert series held on five continents.,Gore’s receipt of the prize hasn’t been as widely accepted as his movie, and legitimately so. The distinguished connotations of a Nobel Prize don’t apply to Gore’s accomplishments to his professed cause, especially because Gore was hardly a proclaimed environmentalist two years ago. Most Nobel Prize Laureates have dedicated their life, or a large portion of it, to researching and uncovering a solution to their field. Gore, on the other hand, is essentially an amateur in his field and his contribution—most notably a film in which he’s the effective star and the Earth plays a supporting role—is less than innovative.,Gore’s input largely comes in the form of glamourizing global warming rather than in creating actual change. The data laid out in An Inconvenient Truth isn’t new or groundbreaking—it’s the product of decades of research that Gore grossly simplified, spun into a fancy PowerPoint that he presented in person on camera and then bundled up for mass distribution.,The good intentions are there—Gore seems to recognize the urgency of climate change and seeks to expose it to the rest of the world. Whether his efforts are worthy of a Nobel Prize is doubtful, however: Gore’s sensationalism of legitimate climate-change concerns may not only misinform but also runs the risk of turning environmentalism into just another fad.,By handing Gore this award, the Nobel Foundation has implied that global warming is an issue that has been tackled and doesn’t require much attention anymore. Additionally, the Nobel Foundation has now effectively thrown its name behind him and any future presidential candidacy he may launch.,Although climate change as a world issue is deserving of the attention this will bring it, the inconvenient truth about this award is simple: Gore wasn’t the worthiest candidate and the award should have gone to a real advocate for change—not an environmental celebrity."},{"title":"We should be down with Downes","url":"/story/2007-10-09/editorials/we-should-be-down-downes/","date":"October 9, 2007","content":"In tomorrow’s provincial election and referendum, Kingstonians will cast their votes to decide which of the six Kingston and the Islands candidates will represent their constituency.,Incumbent Liberal MPP John Gerretsen will run for office again, facing his predominant competition from Conservative candidate John Rapin, NDP candidate Rick Downes and Green Party candidate Bridget Doherty.,For the city of Kingston, in particular, the NDP candidate and his platform have the greatest draw—Downes is in touch with what Kingstonians are seeking not only in their leader, but for their city and the community as a whole.,Last year’s tight mayoral race between Downes and Mayor Harvey Rosen demonstrated that Downes has substantial municipal support and is in touch with the needs of Kingstonians, which is more than can be said for Gerretsen. Downes’ platform in this election is further indicative of his drive to serve the various demographics in his riding.,The provincial NDP’s platform lists six initiatives Downes promises to put into action should he be elected the riding’s MPP. This list includes a health tax rebate to counteract Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty’s tax raise and removing barriers to post-secondary education by lowering and freezing tuition.,That being said, Downes’ proposals aren’t flawless and perhaps he doesn’t fully take into account their feasibility. Downes has included reducing wait times and improving health care among his other dedicated goals—Rapin, on the other hand, has based much of his campaign solely on taking similar action and so can almost be guaranteed to take greater strides in this area, especially given his professional experience in the field.,Kingston residents stand to benefit the greatest from electing Downes as their MPP although it should be noted that NDP leader Howard Hampton remains somewhat of a wild card. From a strictly Kingston and the Islands perspective, however, Downes has shown himself to be capable and should be considered the most apt candidate on the ballot."},{"title":"The results are in, & they’re ugly","url":"/story/2007-10-12/editorials/results-are-and-theyre-ugly/","date":"October 12, 2007","content":"Wednesday night’s provincial election results gave Dalton McGuinty’s Liberals another majority government despite garnering only 42.2 per cent of the vote. In Kingston and the Islands, incumbent Liberal MPP John Gerretsen received 47.2 per cent of the vote to keep his seat and continue his 12-year presence in politics.,Only 36.7 per cent of Ontarians were in favour of adopting the mixed member proportional system (MMP), so the current first-past-the-post system (FPTP) will remain in place. Voter turnout overall was a mere 49.3 per cent.,Both the results of the election and referendum were predictable but nonetheless disappointing. After an uninspiring campaign, Gerretsen was re-elected despite his presumptuous attitude throughout the past several weeks and his demonstrably out-of-touch attitude towards issues important to most Kingstonians.,Gerretsen’s victory indicates that most of the Kingston population is driven to uphold the status quo rather than endorse a candidate that shakes things up.,Gerretsen is an example of why students are so disenchanted with voting—his purported concern for students seems nothing more than a façade; he’s quite comfortable in his position and unmotivated to prove himself to his constituents.,The referendum’s outcome was similarly unsatisfactory, as Ontarians voted to keep the FPTP instead of opting for MMP. The ballot’s wording alone could easily incline people to be wary of an alternative and instead stick to what they know, which is what the vast majority of voters did.,What’s puzzling is that the numbers from the election—which saw notable increase in support for smaller parties—imply that Ontarians would benefit from a system like MMP, which has greater proportional representation and would have given those less-mainstream parties a greater role.,Elections Ontario deserves some blame for its desultory and confusing education campaign. Advertising was minimal and voters essentially had to go digging if they wanted sufficient information.,Another election, another pathetic turnout and a disproportional legislative assembly formed. Gerretsen needs to stop pretending to care and needs to start using his position in an influential way. And as for the low turnout and the rejection of MMP, Ontarians now risk hypocrisy should they criticize their government and its power, and that’s just sad."},{"title":"An opressive silent treatment","url":"/story/2007-10-02/editorials/opressive-silent-treatment/","date":"October 2, 2007","content":"The Asian country of Myanmar, formerly Burma, has been under military rule for 45 years, and, since mid-August, has been facing its most violent anti-junta uprising yet after the government further increased gas prices. After protestors garnered the support of Myanmar’s much-revered monk population, the demonstrations gained momentum and became increasingly volatile in the past week.,Although Myanmarese officials claimed only 10 protestors were killed in Wednesday’s bloody clashes, Western governments estimate the death toll to be much higher.,The Myanmarese government continues its iron-fisted rule, resulting in egregious violations of many basic rights including freedom of the press and access to information. Reporters have found themselves stranded as they try to do their jobs, with the internet being cut nationwide last Friday.,Cutting off these lines of communication is extremely dangerous. Freedom of the press is a crucial tool in situations such as Myanmar’s—without accurate and frequent news to inform the world of what’s going on, very little can be done to work towards a resolution.,International efforts are effective only if organizations such as the U.N. have full understanding of the crisis. The opressive stance Myanmar’s government has taken towards the media prevents those outside their country from seeing a comprehensive picture and results in global inaction.,The world’s media are struggling to deal with the restrictions—Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders has asked for international support and an increasing amount of press corporations, such as Reuters and Associated Press, have begun to rely on information from unofficial sources inside the country.,The heavy constraints on communication in Myanmar make it more difficult to hold the government accountable for its oppressive actions. If the accessibility of information continues to decrease, there’s a good chance the already thinly spread global relief organizations will be unable to provide necessary assistance as well.,The responsibility now rests on reporters and citizen journalists to get the word out on what’s going on in Myanmar.

I don’t care to speculate as to the conflict.,Once again I was grateful to have been safely behind the brick walls of this fine institution.,Don’t get me wrong; I don’t begrudge anyone their fun, regardless of the state of my own love life.

The course material seemed interesting enough, but I knew walking into the room that it would have to be nothing short of riveting and presented in an engaging way if I were going to survive that lengthy slot.,Half-an-hour in, all seemed to be going well. And then the professor announced that we would spend the next 40 minutes listening to a Podcast.,Thanks to technology, she noted, she would no longer be bringing in as many guest lecturers. Podcasts and other sorts of material available via the World Wide Web would instead be her supplement.,I think it was after approximately five minutes of that day’s Podcast that I fell into a deep slumber, lulled to sleep by the repetitive swirling colours of the computer screen saver.,And it was at approximately 5:35 that evening that I logged on to QCARD for some hardcore add-dropping. Call me old-fashioned, but when I step into a classroom, I expect a professor standing at the front, ready to teach.,Don’t get me wrong—I’m a big fan of technology. My laptop and I share a very close relationship and my iPod is my constant companion. I spend a ridiculous amount of time online in both a productive and, I must admit, time-wasting capacity.,I understand and appreciate the educational value of the vast amount of information and wide array of resources made available by the Internet, but it seems that rather than being used to supplement course material, it’s being used as a replacement for actual teaching.,Some of the best lectures I’ve had at Queen’s have been by professors who shun technology and rely on old-fashioned methods such as actually lecturing and occasionally scribbling on the blackboard. Instead of relying on flashy fonts and graphics to capture their students’ attention, the professors are animated speakers who engage their classroom.,And on the other side of the podium, too, I have to complain about technology.,I’m speaking as a notepad-and-pen convert—in the long-ago days of my first and second years, I hauled my laptop dutifully to and from every class, tapping away on the keys to try and capture every word of the lecture. A sore back and dying battery may have been my reason for investing in some ballpoint pens and lined paper, but I can’t say I long for my laptop days.,My notes may not be quite as thorough as the verbatim monologue I was able to transcribe on the laptop, but they capture the most important facets of the lecture. Furthermore, pen and paper encourages me to stay focused in the lecture—there’s no wireless on my notepad, no solitaire game hiding on the back pages to distract both myself and those around me.,In my experience, it’s only in tutorials and seminars that you’re guaranteed a reprieve from computer-oriented teaching.

That’s no surprise, given our choices: each of the parties has pulled out a laundry list of promises for post-secondary education that are either far-fetched or ignore the problem altogether.,The parties’ apparent ignorance of what students need speaks to students’ own failure to articulate that need: campaigning parties focus on health care and pensions because those are the primary concerns of their most vocal constituents—those 45 and older.,If we as students want to be looked upon as more than just a delinquent demographic we need to have an active voice in the machinations of our political leaders.,Choosing not to vote or spoiling your ballot out of “conviction” or disillusionment with “the system” is the electoral equivalent of throwing a temper tantrum: it may make you feel better, but when was the last time a cranky two-year-old dictated public policy?"},{"title":"English as a second option","url":"/story/2007-09-28/editorials/english-second-option/","date":"September 28, 2007","content":"It’s been almost three weeks since the incoming ArtSci ’11 students have been taunted by the Frosh Week chants telling them they’re doomed to work at McDonald’s.

Seeing as I have little patience for children, I cringe at the sight of blood on Grey’s Anatomy and I’m hardly aggressive enough to raise my voice let alone fight in a courtroom, I quickly found myself running out of options.,So, I became an English major.,This decision may have been based on little more than process of elimination, but it seemed like a good idea back in Grade 12 when I was registering for university. I looked forward to getting to read all sorts of literature and even attending one or two classes that I might be able to enjoy.,However, upon choosing to go into this notoriously impractical major, everyone I met would inevitably ask the daunting question, “What do you want to do with your English degree?”,I would attempt to feign a somewhat plausible answer—something that I had learned to do with much practice over my years of education—but I never really felt sure about any of the things I was saying.,At first I was jealous of my housemates who were in nursing and had a clear path mapped out for their careers as soon as they got their diplomas at graduation. But over the years, I learned that being an arts student isn’t so bad after all. The teacher-doctor-lawyer spectrum of vocations expanded as new opportunities emerged and I began to find a little bit of guidance for my ambitions. Looking to my interests in magazines and reading, I began to aspire towards journalism, getting good experience in the field and learning lots along the way.

MMP ensures each party’s number of seats at Queen’s Park reflects its proportion of the vote.,One of the benefits of adopting MMP would be to reduce the significant power dichotomy that’s often the result of majority governments. MMP would allow for a greater diversity of viewpoints and would also, in the case of a minority government, demonstrate the ability of the smaller parties to affect the vote. As a result, the overly dominant tendencies of majority governments would be subdued.,Another plus to the proposed system is that the apathetic notion of voters that their vote won’t count at all will no longer hold true. Constituents will find candidates in their riding will cater more directly to their interests, and at the same time parties with widespread support will have improved representation in the Legislative Assembly.,MMP gives voters a greater capacity to influence the make-up of their legislature, because their vote will be counted toward their preferred party’s total regardless of whether their local candidate wins. In contrast to this, the disconnected results from FPTP elections discourage voters from supporting any party that doesn’t have a concentrated following.,MMP isn’t without flaws, however. It doesn’t offer a viable solution to the undemocratic process of local candidates being selected by a minority of the population instead. The “list members” aspect of MMP is such an indirect selection process that it’s hardly democratic.,It’s doubtful MMP will receive the necessary 60 per cent vote to pass tomorrow night. The proposed system’s success is dependent on people’s motivation to both understand it and care about its outcomes.,If adopted, MMP would certainly improve upon the shortcomings of Ontario’s current system.

The volunteers will act as a sounding board for students and can give advice on issues that aren’t considered overly serious. In cases where the issue may require professional help, the counsellor is there to redirect students to where they can find what they need.,The very fact this project is getting off the ground is impressive, and its proponent, AMS Vice-President (University Affairs) Julia Mitchell should be commended. It’s not without pitfalls, however.,Mitchell said volunteers will receive appropriate training suited to the problems they may be asked to address. But one day of instruction—the amount of time the AMS has dedicated to the training—doesn’t seem enough time to ensure the volunteers are knowledgeable on some of the difficult issues that may confront them.,There’s an appeal to having a peer—someone your own age, who may have comparable experiences—offer guidance. For those who can’t talk to friends about their problems, or who seek an active listener, the centre will undoubtedly provide a useful service.,However, there are downfalls to potentially having one of your classmates giving you advice on your personal matters, notably the issue of confidentiality. Although the AMS is asking all volunteers to sign a confidentiality agreement, it’s debatable how anonymous a student can be when he or she may bump into their counsellor in line at Alfie’s the night after a session.,This isn’t to say the counsellors won’t take their jobs seriously, but it might be unreasonable to expect complete confidence when this type of service is operating in such a small community.,As a service aiming to provide an understanding ear for students, the Peer Support Centre will probably be successful. Its blueprint, however, remains rough around the edges and may require another draft to ensure students have access to safe and confidential counselling—not just a sympathetic ear."},{"title":"Weekend plans too little too late","url":"/story/2007-10-12/editorials/weekend-plans-too-little-too-late/","date":"October 12, 2007","content":"Homecoming 2007 starts today and as thousands of Queen’s students and alumni venture out into the streets this weekend, there’s little doubt that the next 48 hours will see its share of confrontations, glass-punctured feet and overall disobedience.,Looking back to the days and weeks leading up to last year’s Homecoming, it’s abundantly clear that all parties involved weren’t just aware of the situation—they were all over it like broken glass on pavement. Preparation for the 2006 event wasn’t simply a co-operative effort from all parties, including the University, the AMS, police and city council; it was indicative of a determination to make the Homecoming 2005 debacle an anomaly.,Perhaps it was the turnover in the composition of this year’s city council, or maybe it was simply a change of attitude—either way, safety as a priority for Homecoming has been replaced by a drive by the city to end the party altogether, combined with an alarmingly lackadaisical attitude on the part of the University and the AMS.,Shifting the blame in this situation is an appealing tactic and visitors to Queen’s are an easy target. That’s demonstrated by 2005’s car-flipping incident, whose instigators were apparently from out of town or in high school. The reality, however, is Queen’s students are hosts to these people, and we have invited not only them but also the reputation that draws them to Kingston every fall.,Communication between the various parties involved seems to have broken down somewhere; collaborative efforts never got off the ground this year. All sides, however, appear to have taken for granted that the relative calm of last year’s Aberdeen Street party would carry over. They ignore the fact that half of the current undergraduate population weren’t even Queen’s students during Homecoming 2005 and so don’t have its consequences impressed upon them as a deterrent.,Although efforts such as the AMS posters asking students to “please be safe” are on the right track, it may be too little too late. Now, it’s up to students themselves to avoid the mob mentality and keep the weekend safe and sane.,Ultimately, destruction and harm are the results of individual actions. As foggy as their choices may be, students should remember to check their stupidity at the door when they set out for Aberdeen Street this Saturday."},{"title":"A (closed) New York state of mind","url":"/story/2007-09-28/editorials/closed-new-york-state-mind/","date":"September 28, 2007","content":"When Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived to speak at Columbia University this Monday, he was met with taunts from the press and thousands of protestors. The University had already faced a division amongst students and faculty as to whether the school should have invited Ahmadinejad as a speaker at its World Leaders Forum.,The event’s most incendiary comments, however, did not come from Ahmadinejad; rather, they came from the University’s president, Lee Bollinger. In his opening speech, Bollinger called Ahmadinejad a “petty and cruel dictator” with a “fanatical mindset” as the Iranian leader sat back and smiled.,The problem with Bollinger’s address, regardless of whether one agrees with his condemnation of Ahmadinejad, was the accusatory and blatantly rude words Bollinger used.,The University had every right to invite Ahmadinejad to speak, and a critical discussion about his controversial views could have shed light on them and his government’s numerous human rights violations. Including a verbal attack in a welcome speech not only lacked proper decorum, but also eliminated any possible discussion that could have arisen.,It’s reasonable for Bollinger to hold views that may acutely contrast with those held by his guest, but the protests outside were a more suitable forum for voicing that opinion. Extending Ahmadinejad an invitation to speak meant Bollinger and the organizers at Columbia weren’t just facilitators of his appearance, but hosts as well, which they seem to have forgotten.,Perhaps the event would have created less controversy had it been an open dialogue between the president and representatives from the student body. Although his appearance was sensationalized on its own, Bollinger’s comments caused an even bigger stir than necessary.,It may be the case that Ahmadinejad’s perspectives held no value for the majority of his listeners, whether it’s his historically inaccurate denial of the Holocaust or his oppression of women in Iran.,Regardless, it isn’t acceptable to ask someone to make a speech only to lead up to it by raking them over the coals.,There’s a huge rift in worldviews between Western ideologies and those promoted by leaders such as Ahmadinejad, but that rift won’t be reconciled unless open discussions are welcomed on both sides.

Tickets to varsity games are free.,What drafters of the proposal seem to forget is the consequences of this suggestion: tacking on more student fees will likely decrease both participation in recreational activities and attendance at interuniversity games.,Intramural sports hold an important spot in campus life, and adopting the proposed policy would be exclusionary. Charging to play on recreational teams would create an imbalance between prospective participants who can or can’t afford to join.,The fees would detract from the fun of intramural sports, adding the additional disincentive that if you can’t make it to a game, you’re squandering your money.,The suggestion that tickets to varsity sports games should carry a price is also a questionable goal—with turnout already low, imposing an entrance fee would only further discourage attendees.,Athletics and Recreation Chair Leslie Dal Cin asserted that charging admission would add value to varsity games. In an attempt to promote sports at the University, Dal Cin seems to regard credibility as something that can be created rather than earned.,Asking students to pay additional fees in order to participate could put more money in the department’s pocket, but it would also put a damper on the school spirit for which Queen’s is renowned.,Requiring separate payments for intramurals and fitness classes would mean less accessibility for a higher price. Watching interuniveristy games at a cost is hardly an incentive to support our varsity teams, and would probably result in an even more dismal turnout. Realistically, extracting athletic funds by slapping on more student fees would diminish school pride and decrease student athletic involvement altogether."},{"title":"Nightmare on Alfred Street","url":"/story/2007-09-25/editorials/nightmare-alfred-street/","date":"September 25, 2007","content":"Coming into the last September of my undergraduate year, I expected no surprises and smooth sailing—only to find out quickly that it’s never safe to assume anything out of life.,At the end of the first week at my new apartment, my roommate and I had no idea why we developed severe allergies and shortness of breath, until we spotted large quantities of black mould behind the kitchen cupboard and the stove. The problem hit a climax when my roommate found out the mould had spread to her bedframe; as I was sipping coffee at the Common Ground, she called and said, “I’m not living here anymore.”,Enter my mid-September house hunt, and a battle against the Unsympathetic Landlady. Instead of easing into our schedules and catching up with friends, we spent our first week checking the accommodation listing online every day, frantically writing down addresses and phone numbers of landlords. My landlady’s simple answer to the discovery of mould was, “So, you want out?” When we showed her a letter of complaint, all she said was that we shouldn’t have lived in a basement apartment if we had breathing problems—but these “breathing problems” didn’t emerge until we started living in the mouldy basement. She also initially refused to give us back our cheques for October, until we pointed out that we could contact a health inspector—to which she replied, “Whatever, I don’t want to deal with this.” In the end she terminated the lease, and gave us back all our cheques. Difficult landlady aside, the support and sympathy from everyone around me has been more than anything I could’ve imagined. Countless people have offered me their couches, pull-out beds, and even a part of their bed space itself, as well as cars and helping hands with moving to the new place. Joan Jones at Town-Gown Relations has helped tremendously with drafting the letter, letting us know of our rights when we weren’t so sure and encouraging us to be as assertive as we could.,My friends never expressed annoyance when I showed up to their doors unexpected and unannounced, whined endlessly, or snapped for no reason because I felt entitled to be in a bad mood. There were so many times when I just wanted to quit school and stop everything I was doing. Whether it was a dinner party, a phone call to invite me over or e-mails of encouragement, everyone made sure that I had a healthy place to sleep and wasn’t sulking away on my own. Being “homeless” has taught me many things: that there might be a reason behind a ridiculously cheap rent, that having a healthy home is important not only for the body but also for the mind, and that having a strong support network can make the worst of times into a fun memory of sleepovers and hospitality that lets me keep my laptop in one house and my toothbrush in another."},{"title":"Queen’s caught cutting class","url":"/story/2007-09-21/editorials/queens-caught-cutting-class/","date":"September 21, 2007","content":"All University departments are being forced to tighten their belts following four per cent budget cuts across the board.

They caused the mechanical engineering department to cut six of its courses. Now students—many of them entering their final year—are left baffled by the suddenness of their current situation. Some are unsure they will graduate on time, or worry they won’t have the requirements they need when they enter the workforce.,The University says its actions were necessary becuase of unusually high wage, salary and pension increases coupled with insufficient government funding. Because Queen’s can’t run a deficit, the argument goes, the four per cent cuts had to be made.,Although it’s not the University’s fault they received less money than expected, it could and should have been planned for.,The University seems to have been caught off-guard and its makeshift response leaves students bearing the brunt of the circumstances, even as they pay higher tuition.,The disordered approach to compensating for the potential deficit meant all departments were affected. A more pragmatic process could have seen well-endowed departments receiving smaller cheques instead. At the very least, those affected by the cuts should have been told about them much sooner—a few days before classes begin can hardly be considered sufficient notice.,Queen’s touts its high-quality education and facilities to some of the top students in the country, and yet students—ostensibly the University’s major stakeholders—were left high and dry. As the University seeks to boast renowned researchers and professors as part of its faculty, it has mixed up its priorities.,It seems funds for undergraduate education are being spread thinner each year. Even though Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane is consulting all faculty deans regarding how to absorb the cuts, the last-minute cut courses and overflowing seminars indicate the University needs to determine a more efficient and effective way to distribute funds.,Budget cuts are often a necessary evil, but there’s a right and a wrong way to make them.

My array of stickers was pretty average, but I had one page in my collection book that no one could even contend with—my page of traditional Hindu bindis.,I think it was around that time, at the oh-so-cultured age of six, that I began to think that having a mixed background was cool. Through my teens, my Indo-Canadian blood sometimes meant my appearance was more awkward than cool, but I’ve grown to be proud of it.,My mom emigrated from New Delhi to Belleville, Ontario in 1969, along with my grandparents and my uncle. My dad, originally from Winnipeg, met her in London, Ontario through work. Moving to Canada without knowing a word of English was even harder than they’d imagined, and I guess Belleville wasn’t all they had envisioned either. My mom and uncle moved to Toronto early in their 20s. My grandma, on the other hand, didn’t see the allure of the big city and still lives in Kingston.,Lucky for me, while everyone’s waiting for a half-hour to get a table at Curry Original, I have my own personal chef only 10 minutes away.

I used to be devastated by the mere thought of this, always pitying the family in Home Alone who hauled it down to Miami to spend the holidays. As excited as I am for the trip, I’m terrified at being immersed in a culture so foreign to me and yet so much—half, exactly—of who my family is. I was relieved this week to find out that my grandma will be there at the same time as us, and so I won’t have to explain to all these strangers how we’re related and why I’m in their home, eating their food.,Thinking my background is weird seems ridiculous to me now, and I feel grateful to say that I’ve got parents from two different worlds.

Tonight, city councillors vote on whether to close Aberdeen Street for next Saturday night.,Street closure legalizes the actual gathering of students on the street and blocks cars from access. If the street remains open, said Kingston resident and Queen’s alumnus Vinni Rebelo, many of the volunteers fear police-student confrontations will jeopardize their team’s safety.,Some councillors who are sitting on the fence on this issue contend that by closing the street, the city is condoning the party. But what should supersede that concern is the safety of those in and around the Ghetto, which will be threatened if police spend the night shoving partiers off the street.,Last year, the city, the University, police, residents and the AMS collaborated to prepare for Homecoming. So far this year, however, there seems to be disunity amongst these groups. The AMS in particular has offered very little insight into what precautions they’re taking for the notoriously raucous weekend, perhaps because they’re assuming that last year’s relative calm will simply repeat itself. Given the short-term memory of the student body and the mythology that has built up since Homecoming 2005, this assumption is both foolish and dangerous.,The Aberdeen Street volunteers need to work alongside the city to ensure their own safety. Volunteers last year made a vital contribution to the night’s relaxed tone by handing out plastic cups to reduce the amount of broken glass on Aberdeen Street and the surrounding area. If the street stays open and the volunteers stay clear, not only will the number of injuries from glass and debris skyrocket, but the ability of paramedics to access those in need of help will be hindered.,Those preparing for the weekend seem to have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the whole thing; it’s as though they’re collectively crossing their fingers that the near-riot of 2005 remains a fresh warning in the minds of the students.,Anyone observing the build up to Homecoming 2007 can see the problems next weekend will bring.

At York University, two female students were raped in their dorm rooms and a third escaped unharmed after an attempted attack.,These scenarios immediately raise fears about whether our universities are safe and secure. Because in both cases the aggressor is thought to hold no connections to the victims, one has to ask just how accessible our facilities are to outsiders.,Queen’s labs and campus buildings are locked at night but accessible to anyone with a key, and don’t all have the more secure swipe system. Residences aren’t impressively protected from intruders either. Anyone can enter the buildings by loitering long enough for someone with a key, and few students keep their doors locked at all times. At York, both girls were sleeping with their doors unlocked when their intruders came in.,Queen’s has made sure, however, that if you do lock up, you’ve got nothing to worry about—all residence room locks are designed to resist any forced openings.,Other areas of campus are equally targetable, but perhaps hold a different allure for attackers as the concentration of people and tight-knit atmosphere means their crime will achieve the grandeur they are likely seeking.,Moreover, campuses are home to a large population of young women, the population most vulnerable to attack, and their populations have a reputation for drinking that leaves students less aware of their surroundings.,This isn’t to say Queen’s has been totally inactive in preventing assaults on its grounds. Services such as Walkhome and Campus Security provide students with the option of being safely escorted home, or receiving frequent check-ups if working late on campus. Newer residences, too, have heightened security features to ensure,student protection.,Nevertheless, students should be more aware of what goes on around them, and an evaluation of Queen’s security measures is needed to make campus security not just a concern, but a priority."},{"title":"Cameras’ record not reliable","url":"/story/2007-09-21/editorials/cameras-record-not-reliable/","date":"September 21, 2007","content":"As campus security remains of paramount concern, Queen’s is looking into installing multiple closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras throughout campus.,Queen’s has six cameras located indoors at high-activity locations such as the JDUC and the Campus Bookstore.

The reality is, however, these cameras aren’t of the best quality and many times collecting a clear image of the perpetrator is impossible; the footage would likely not provide adequate evidence, as has been the case in the past.,An expansion of this camera system would blur the line between private and public. Few wouldn’t feel apprehensive knowing some stranger could watch their every move. The Orwellian premise for such infrastructure wouldn’t be justifiable.,The underlying principle here, as Access and Privacy Commissioner Diane Kelly noted, is the need to balance our desire for security with the right to privacy.

The repercussions, Closs said, have left Kingston residents without adequate police coverage.,Emergency calls, including domestic disputes and a threatened suicide, were put on the backburner during Frosh Week. Closs pointed to rowdy students as the root of this debacle—officers were apparently tied up at raucous house parties scattered throughout the Ghetto.,Not only are students unfairly diverting police resources away from other Kingston residents, police say, but students are such miscreants the only solution is to increase the normal posting of two officers in the area to 16 officers on patrol at all times.,Particularly in the last few years, Kingston Police and the Queen’s student community have had a less than functional relationship, although police say they’ve found greater co-operation with the AMS. One has to wonder whether upping the number of patrol cars in the Ghetto will only widen that division.,That some individual students tend to overindulge, and make sure everyone knows it, isn’t worthy of debate. Instead, it’s the attitude towards these individuals that needs readjusting as Queen’s students are portrayed as an aggregate body of drunken slobs.,The police go out of their way to differentiate the Ghetto as its own municipality while simultaneously labelling Queen’s students as a wild group that is causing the city grief and necessitating laborious efforts by police.,If police are understaffed across Kingston, that’s a problem the city needs to address. But if police are attending to illegal keggers before more urgent situations, their priorities are seriously skewed.,Closs’s concerns, such as sexual assault cases rising because of alcohol consumption in the Ghetto, are unlikely to see a major turnaround simply because there are more cars patrolling the streets.,A working relationship can hardly be forged with the “us versus them” mentality this attitude is perpetuating. Until students fully see themselves as Kingston residents it’s difficult and hypocritical to ask the city to do the same. But assertions such as those the Kingston police are making only exacerbates the problem.,Clearly, posting more officers in the Ghetto will be effective in shutting down keggers and nabbing students drinking on the street.

The commission, endorsed by the provincial government and Premier Jean Charest, is intended to explore the extent to which Quebec should make “reasonable accommodations” for its growing minority populations while preserving its distinct culture. The issue of cultural accommodation has increasingly become an issue in Quebec over the past several months.,But, far from “reasonable,” the forum soon became an arena to bash minorities in Quebec. One man offered an anecdote loaded with anti-Muslim sentiments: recalling his time spent in Egypt decades ago, he said he put up with them then and doesn’t want to tolerate them again.,It’s legitimate for the Quebec government to ask how best to accommodate ethnic and religious minorities, and where to draw the line separating diverse multiculturalism and more homogenous integration. That’s a conundrum faced everywhere in an increasingly mobile world.,But as it stands, the commission can hardly be recognized as legitimate—not only because its forum rapidly deteriorated into a slander-ridden debate, but also because only a handful of members of the province’s minorities were actually present.,In a society already affected with widespread Islamaphobia and racist perspective, public declarations embodying the xenophobic attitudes of those at the forum only work to perpetuate them.,Quebeckers need to realize culture isn’t a static concept. It’s fallacious to assert that Quebecois customs and routines can’t exist alongside others.

But before we applaud J.K. Rowling for improving children’s literacy, let’s think for a moment. Are people reading out of a love of reading and literature, or are they reading because they’re buying into a brand?,Harry Potter has become something that isn’t about reading; it’s about consuming. Kids are reading because they want to fit in; they want to know how the book ends. The publicity scandal surrounding Harry Potter “spoilers” indicates how the series has become a product to be marketed rather than a work of writing that can be enjoyed whether or not you know the ending.,A book that gives children the ability to conceptualize a world with wizards and magic is healthy escapism. Running around pretending to be wizards and witches is a healthy product of that escapism. A problem arises when people are obliged to buy the wizard costume and run around in that, as well as Harry Potter glasses, a Hermione Granger action figure and a Dumbledore’s Army messenger bag. On the heels of the book’s release come the movies, stuffed animals, action figures and toy broomsticks, marketed to those who buy into the brand with marketable income to spare.,Harry Potter has become more than a book.

According to a Feb. 5 press release, the project was intended to “define what the Queen’s community expects of Athletics & Recreation at Queen’s.” Former Dean of Student Affairs and computing professor Bob Crawford, who led the review along with Dean of the School Graduate Studies and Research Janice Deakin, said the review would help the University define its “philosophy of sport.” The review’s original deadline was March 30.,In late May, Crawford said the report had been completed and passed to Principal Karen Hitchcock, who was planning the University’s response.,A month later, it’s still there, and no one in Hitchcock’s office can say what she’s doing with it, when it will be released or why the report’s publication has been delayed for so long.,For a project with such ambitious goals and far-reaching implications, this state of affairs is disappointing, to say the least.,The Athletics Review has the potential to shape Queen’s athletics for the next decade or more. Similar reviews have caused schools such as Carleton University, Brock University and the University of Western Ontario to completely rethink their approach to athletics, often cutting some sports in order to free up resources for others.,If Queen’s is to do the same, there’s no doubt that process should be as thorough as possible. Athletics are a vital part of the Queen’s experience for many students, and changes to the department should not be taken lightly.,An obvious concern the delay elicits, of course, is when these changes will be implemented. As Athletics Director Leslie Dal Cin told the Kingston Whig-Standard, the later into the summer the report is released, the harder it will be to put any of its suggested changes into effect.,The University’s lack of transparency in this regard is an even greater concern. To be late in releasing a report is one thing, and has become almost institutionally de rigueur. To refuse to answer questions as to why the report is late, what is being done with it right now or even when it’s being released not only keeps stakeholders in the dark, it also gives the impression that the University is uncertain of the report’s recommendations, and fearful of possible fallout resulting from them.,That’s hardly a winning combination."},{"title":"Leave journalists out of policing","url":"/story/2007-05-29/editorials/journalist-police/","date":"May 29, 2007","content":"On May 19, Vancouver police officers contacted Anti-Poverty Coalition member David Cunningham, claiming to be journalists for the commuter paper 24 Hours and requesting an interview. Cunningham met them, whereupon they arrested him for threats he made to members of Vancouver’s Olympic Games organizing committee.,Cunningham is now out of police custody on a peace bond.,Vancouver Police Department Constable Tim Fanning claimed to have no prior knowledge of the ploy, but said it was motivated by Cunningham’s “background,” which has been confrontational towards the police in the past.,This impersonation of journalists by police officers is a frightening and appalling abuse of power. A journalist’s role is predicated in large part on trust: it’s the journalist’s job to be open in establishing a relationship with a subject and a reader.,These officers’ actions have clouded and mishandled that trust dynamic, and have embedded in people’s minds the suspicion that purported “journalists” may be claiming that title under false pretences.,As well, the nonchalant assumption that there’s nothing wrong with officers taking on the guise of journalist indicates their attitude towards the press as a tool to be exploited when convenient. This compromises the press’s stance as a neutral third party.,This underhanded tactic is an example of overkill at best and gross misconduct at worst. In addition, it casts further doubt on police credibility—not a wise move for a profession based on the exercise of authority. Can members of the public be blamed for fearing or mistrusting the police when the people whose job it is to protect them have no qualms about willfully misleading them?,Fanning’s excuse that, “if they had asked me before they did it … I’d say, don’t,” is a pathetic and clumsy cover, and leads the public to believe that either this constable is incompetent and has no control over his officers or that he’s a liar. Neither option is remotely appealing.,This underhanded behavior paints a sorry picture of the state of Canada’s free press and the lack of respect its law-enforcement officers bear it.,Vancouver’s police department should take swift disciplinary action against all those involved in Cunningham’s arrest, both to deter such activities in the future and to prove to the public that the police respect the freedom of the press and understand why these unacceptable actions impinge upon that freedom."},{"title":"A little less cheer, a little more beer","url":"/story/2007-09-07/editorials/little-less-cheer-little-more-beer/","date":"September 7, 2007","content":"When Frosh Week kicked off on Wednesday, the thundering of demolition work was barely audible over the cheers of first-years, led by their equally spirited frosh leaders, parading through campus. Although the noise and energy is typical of every year, close attention would soon have any upper-year at a loss for words—literally.,In an attempt to promote a politically correct Frosh Week, any cheers referencing alcohol are no longer used. The effectiveness of such drastic moves is questionable, and their superficiality is apparent. By asking leaders to deny any involvement with alcohol, they’re essentially ignoring the issue: just because it isn’t discussed doesn’t mean it isn’t going on, and the frosh are well aware.,The goal of curbing excessive alcohol consumption is commendable, especially at a university known for its hearty partying. But changing “drunk frosh, totally lost” to “fun frosh, totally lost” is not going to convince kids to stay in and play a sober game of Go Fish instead of stumbling the 10-minute walk to Smijies. The frosh aren’t ignorant, nor are they alleviated from the pressures to drink simply because it hasn’t been mentioned during group activities.,An integral part of being a Gael, Frec, Boss or Teach is setting an example and acting as a relatable mentor for those in unfamiliar territory at Queen’s. Any effective communication lines are severed the moment a leader sets unrealistic behavioural standards—seeking advice may seem futile for frosh when asking it of an ostensibly moral person. Frosh need to be able to pull their leader aside, ask them about their university experience, and expect an honest answer.,In drastically censoring activities and conversation, Frosh Week organizers have perhaps gone too far. The conduct expected of both frosh and group leaders is hardly rational, and is out of sync with reality. The appeal of getting drunk isn’t lost by its elimination from Frosh Week cheers—if anything, it’s heightened. This year, it will be interesting to see just how many 18-year-olds leave their red plastic beer cups crumpled on the Ghetto’s sidewalks."},{"title":"Ain’t no Hollaback Girl","url":"/story/2007-09-11/editorials/aint-no-hollaback-girl/","date":"September 11, 2007","content":"Last Thursday started off like any other—after a late night of putting an issue of the Journal together, I set out on my usual route home. Though the walk is a particularly precarious route through patches of unlit sidewalk and creepy old houses, I’ve only recently started to become wary of it. After the recent sexual assaults at Carleton and York University, who can blame me?,As I approached a street corner, I was caught off-guard by the alcohol-soaked heckles of two male passersby.,“Hey baby, what’s up?” crooned Idiot #1, stumbling past me. I ignored them, pretending to fiddle with my cell phone. With a roll of my eyes and the intention of pretending I didn’t hear him, I kept walking.,“Come on, dude, leave her alone,” laughed Idiot #2. Much to my surprise, Idiot #1 shot back something that has echoed in my mind ever since.,“If she’s showing that much flesh, she deserves it.” Clad in shorts, flats, a t-shirt, and a scarf, I didn’t feel as if I was giving off a sexy vibe. Frankly, after staring at a computer screen in an office without air conditioning all day, I was sweaty, exhausted and downright unkempt. Ask any young female if she has been catcalled, taunted, or followed on the street, and you’ll be bombarded with a wealth of stories ranging from hilarious encounters to highly dangerous situations.,Herein lies the geography of fear, the way we appropriate our bodies and inhabit public spaces in accordance with the precedent of fear set by our particular community. Women are advised not to walk alone at night, and those in short skirts and high heels are thought to be “asking for it.” The sheer sexism of the notion that woman must tone down what they wear and strategically decide where they walk at night in order to curb the appetite of lurking eyes is disgusting. Unwanted attention—from name calling to sexual assault—is unwarranted, no matter how short the skirt or how desolate the neighbourhood.,When I go out late at night, the only thing I’m asking for is a safe walk home, free of catcalls. Perverts, rapists, and drunken students with loud enough voices and not enough sense will always exist, but it will only be when the victimized band together and refuse to be intimidated that they can reclaim their public space.,Catcalling, taunting, and making a space uncomfortable for any person is inappropriate regardless of whether the person yelling the comment is male or female. The threat of assault is a very real issue at Queen’s, but I refuse to be afraid.,There’s an overwhelming need to be safe when walking home alone at night, but there’s no need to limit your movement according to the geography of fear.,Stay in the light, call Walkhome, walk with a group of friends, and take back the night—you deserve it."},{"title":"Hold the canapés, please","url":"/story/2007-07-31/editorials/hold-canaps-please/","date":"July 31, 2007","content":"When I was 19, I spent the summer as an unpaid intern in Toronto, and my boyfriend moved in with me. It was more a matter of convenience than any romantic notion of eternal bliss. Unfortunately, we grossly underestimated the cost of living… and grossly overestimated his employability. When he wound up toiling at minimum wage for a landscaping company, we knew it would be a summer on a serious shoestring. Thus, the decision was made to cut our losses and cohabitate, in an apartment so small that I could stretch my arms out and simultaneously be in the kitchen, bedroom and living room.,Maybe it was this, my first foray into the territory of an adult relationship, being more a matter of money than love, or maybe it’s the sadness I’ve seen in other couples when their own wedded bliss met an early demise, that makes me so emphatic about my own refusal to tie the knot. No matter what first provoked me, my initial decision has only been bolstered by the myriad of reasons I’ve come across that make me more than happy to permanently avoid the altar.,I’ll admit, I often let my practical side overwhelm more whimsical fancies, but am I crazy to suggest that spending thousands on a wedding (and the accompanying stag parties and spa visits) might not be the most prudent financial choice for a young couple just eking out a living? Sure, I might rake in the gifts, but do I really need hand-painted Moroccan cutlery to dine in my IKEA-and-milk-crate-inspired apartment? Probably not. Studies have found that the average wedding runs upwards of $25,000. I can’t help but envision my future children, suitcases in hand, heading to university with their tuition paid by the dollars and cents that I didn’t spend on a designer gown, catered buffet for 200 guests, and staged black-and-white shots of my partner and I basking under a leafy tree. Don’t get me wrong—I’m not entirely devoid of human sentiment, and I admit that weddings can be delightful affairs. What I fail to see is how one day of elaborate, romantic finery, or the resulting photo albums and gem on my finger, will really make or break my relationship. Romance and passion is not a day, a photo or a ring—it is partners who revel in the every day; a surprise picnic lunch, a neck massage, a wink over a shared inside joke. I worry that marriage would eliminate the spontaneity that I enjoy. Feeling forced to commemorate the same day, every year, seems a little contrived. I’ll take the surprise candlelight dinner “just because” over the night of fine dining “just because it’s May 10” any day.,Luckily, with my go-with-the-flow-yoga-loving father and family’s “we celebrate the Christmas of consumerism” approach to religion, the barriers to a marriage-free life don’t exist. For those who find themselves in a position where marriage is the only option, I can only ask two things: One, don’t blow your last penny on that silk veil lined with pressed flower petals - you will not find an occasion to wear it again. Two, remember that the romance isn’t in a wedding day, but in the person, and the memories you’ll make in the everyday."},{"title":"Insights from an introvert","url":"/story/2007-09-14/editorials/insights-introvert/","date":"September 14, 2007","content":"When I was six years old, my favourite song was a Sesame Street ditty called, “I don’t want to live on the moon.” I sympathized with Ernie because, quite frankly, I didn’t want to live on the moon, either. My little six-year-old self was horrified by the thought. Who would I talk to? Who would I play with? His wistful strains resonated with my childish fear of feeling lonely. Since then, times have changed. My fear of being alone has become a compulsive desire to soak up as much solitude as I can between my deadline-oriented editing job and the two courses I’m taking because the AMS says I have to. Yes, it’s true. I am a jaded fifth-year student.,Gone are the days when a Friday night included heading to Stages in clubbing garb (thank goodness). My Friday nights these days either include toiling at this newspaper or reading, writing and reflecting in my room or in one of my usual downtown haunts—alone.,It gives me time to think, breathe and feel healthy. The cycle of binge drinking and binge studying at Queen’s is something I’ve never understood. I certainly used to perpetuate it, and now that I’m older and wiser, or maybe just tired, I’ve realized it’s not a healthy or self-satisfying lifestyle for me.,Making the choice to return to Queen’s as an undergraduate student for a fifth year was a difficult one. My housemates and friends from years past have graduated, my degree is finished and everyone my age seems either to be in graduate school or working in downtown Toronto. I came back this year for the Journal. I also came back to put into practice what I’d learned in my first four years—how to drink and party less and think more—and turn myself around. We’re only a week into the school year and already this time around feels different, and not just because of the diggers and machinery that were missing in my other four years here.,Don’t get me wrong, I love my friends. Going out to the pub for a beer or trying out a new restaurant are enjoyable ways to spend an evening filled with animated conversation. But my circle here has gotten smaller, which leaves me with more time to invest into the friends I love who are still here, and more time to invest the way I would like. It finally feels the way I thought university would feel from the start. I can curl up and watch a movie without feeling guilty or feeling as though I’m missing out. I’ve realized sometimes I just need time on my own.,I’m not sure if solitude is something you grow into being comfortable with, or something you learn or something some people never find.,But I would like nothing more than to spend my down time doing just that—calming down. Give me a mug of hot chocolate, a pillow, a good book and call me 65-years-old, but that’s what I’ll be doing next Friday.

They figured that if I ever got into an accident, everything would be okay if I had a cell phone. Apparently they hadn’t noticed the growing number of drivers swerving across the roadways in their attempts to steer while juggling their bite-sized cell phones.,I’ve been a somewhat reluctant cell-phone user since that year, but it wasn’t until I began to write for the Journal that my phone became an integral part of my life, its shrill ringtone driving both me and my housemates up the wall. I tend to keep my phone at the bottom of a bag inside my closet. By the time I answer it, I’m usually out of breath and inadvertently speaking at about twice the decibel level I would in a standard, pre-Verizon exchange.,That’s me. Then there are other girls­—those who talk on the phone while they’re waiting for the bus, walking to class, standing in line, or eating their lunch. Those who forget to turn down their ring volume, causing varied—often entertaining—reactions from professors.,The other night, though, I saw something that fascinated me even more than the girl who eats, sleeps and breathes cellular conversation. I watched how a guy attempting to charm a group of girls dealt with his cell phone. Once or twice, he opened the phone as if expecting to find a text message. A few times he dialed a number, put the phone to his ear, said nothing, and flipped it closed again. At one point, his phone actually rang. The seven-word conversation that resulted wasn’t worth following, but it made me think.,Who was he talking to? What were they talking about? Was he a powerful financial analyst? Perhaps he was a Tinseltown mogul in need of frequent updates on his chaotic schedule. Chances are he was merely hoping that his friend—a much more corporeal social crutch than a Razr—would return to help him fortify his outpouring of witty remarks concerning accomplishments in the consumption of alcohol. But in the meantime, the apparent popularity given to him by his excessive cell-phone use might have made him feel just a little bit better about himself.,A quick visit to Wikipedia told me that in a number of countries, including England, there are actually more “mobiles” than there are people. Perhaps having multiple cell phones is like having multiple friends around to help you impress the ladies.,The cell phone offers not only a means to communicate with others; these days, cell phones are cameras, photo albums, video cameras, MP3 players, board games, and mini-computers. Somehow, cell phones are becoming our new best friends. The days of awkward lulls in conversation are days of the past. After all, you never know when a time-sensitive, potentially life-altering text message will pop up, allowing you to regain your cool. If you have a cell phone, you must be important. Right? I have nothing against convenient methods of communication. I simply think that we need to deglamourize our concept of the cell phone.

During Frosh Week and at Homecoming games, I enthusiastically donned my coveralls and sang the Oil Thigh.,It wasn’t until last year, while walking home, I noticed a sign advertising a variety show called “The Sport of Kings.” Having that one line singled out startled me—the answer to the question, “What’s the sport of Kings?” is of course, “Queen’s, Queen’s, Queen’s.” I was horrified by the implications of such a simple line—such a gendered imbalance of sexual power.,What struck me most was how ill-fitting this type of oppression seemed at this University. While Gaels are being trained to be sensitive in the matters of sexuality and gender issues, they’re singing and teaching frosh the patriarchal lyrics to our school song.,Although this might seem like just another incidence of something fun being “ruined” by political correctness, the Oil Thigh isn’t just offensive—it’s a bad reflection of the truth of this University’s heritage.,The Queen’s identity is deeply embedded in tradition, and though some traditions have lasted, others have been required to adapt and change to more fully represent the nature of this university.,In 1869, Queen’s became the first university in Canada to allow female students to enroll. The first two women in Ontario to get graduate degrees did so at Queen’s. Until 1942, women weren’t allowed to take applied science. In 1949, Nancy Scarth was the first female to graduate with an applied science degree because tradition wasn’t a good enough reason to deny her.,Other traditions have changed with the times as well—in the late 19th century, it was the “tradition” during Orientation week for female students to participate in sedate, ladylike activities like a candle-lighting ceremony. Today we have women participating in the pandemonium of Frosh Olympics and the Grease Pole, because we’ve done away with tradition that says that women are essentially different from men.,Even the Oil Thigh itself has changed. Originally written in 1898 by Alfred Lavell, the original line “So boys, go in and win” was changed in 1985 to “So Gaels, go in and win,” because women were such an important part of Queen’s athletics.,In an 1876 editorial in the Journal, a writer said, “We are confident that among people who appreciate the delicate grace and beauty of a woman’s character too much to expose it to the rude influences, the bitterness and strife of the world, few will be found to advocate her admission to universities.” Things can, and do, change.,Beyond school fight songs and Boohoo the Bear, this school has made a tradition out of being progressive in the area of liberating women from patriarchal oppression. That’s a tradition worth holding on to."},{"title":"The Cleavers would be shocked","url":"/story/2007-09-18/editorials/cleavers-would-be-shocked/","date":"September 18, 2007","content":"Earlier this week Statistics Canada released the results from its latest census on Canadian households.,The polls, taken during 2006, found Canada is perpetually diversifying its familial structures; stats show that same-sex couples, single parents, and common law marriages have all increased since 2001, with married couples in decline.,In Thursday’s Globe and Mail, the census and its numbers were the subjects of apprehensive, almost xenophobic commentary. Both the Globe’s editorial and columnist Margaret Wente’s commentary oversimplified the institution of marriage while at the same time wagging antiquated fingers at anyone who wasn’t a member of a husband-wife-2.1 kids family.,Raising kids properly, according to the editorial, is almost entirely reliant on their being brought up by married parents. Common law parents aren’t included in this label, and can’t provide the same “solidity” of a traditionally married couple simply because they statistically separate sooner into the relationship, according to the article.,But what the Statscan census is really saying is that alternative lifestyles are becoming increasingly common—this perception of an apparent “norm” no longer applies in Canada.,Just because kids from single mother or father families are more likely to “possess poorer language skills,” as the Globe’s editorial suggests, doesn’t mean a parental reconciliation is going to get the kid straight A’s.,Wente creates an aggressively capitalist spin on her interpretation of the census and simplifies marriage as part of a process to achieving financial wealth, wherein a child is the final product. This demonstrates a shallow and utilitarian take on a very personal lifestyle choice.,Both the editorial and Wente’s commentary perpetuate stigmas attached to same-sex, single-parent and common-law families, entrenching biases with Canadian institutions that make it more difficult for less-than-“mainstream” couples to raise a family.,It’s important to acknowledge that not everyone believes the nuclear family is the ideal one. As we, as a society, continually redefine the notion of “family,” it becomes apparent that marriage is no longer necessary to validate one’s life. Instead, Canadians are realizing that validation can come in other ways than just saying ‘I do.’"},{"title":"Blunders fuel pub powder keg","url":"/story/2007-09-07/editorials/blunders-fuel-pub-powder-keg/","date":"September 7, 2007","content":"The Engineering Society executive’s announcement earlier this summer that Clark Hall Pub is closed indefinitely came as a shock to many—not because the pub’s operational and financial woes were surprising but because of the way the closing of such a campus fixture was handled. The EngSoc executive decided unilaterally to close the pub, but many of the pub’s stakeholders—including employees and engineering students—weren’t consulted before action was taken. Council approval, usually necessary during the school year, was waived. Pub staff were informed via e-mail they were out of a job and that a re-opening date was not in the foreseeable future. EngSoc still doesn’t know when Clark will reopen, or what exactly went wrong with its finances in the first place.,Considering the number of people with stakes in the pub and its services, it’s disconcerting to see such little semblance of a plan for its future. With Clark’s doors still shut, Queen’s traditions such as ritual, and Queen’s Players are at the very least suspended.,It’s unfortunate Clark Hall Pub was unable to stay afloat on its own. The pub’s problems and the haphazard way EngSoc is handling its closure—which itself was in large part instigated by the concerns of external bodies such as the University and the AMS—portrays students as incompetent and unable to run a service.,Sadly, Clark Hall is not an anomaly—the AMS and ASUS have had similar experiences of inefficiency and financial discordance with many of their services. Two years ago, ASUS lost $26,403, the whereabouts of which are still unknown. The AMS’s Tricolour Outfitters and UBS, formerly Greenroom, formerly UBS have been rebranded so many times no one knows what they’re called, let alone what they sell and where they are.,This attempt to fix years of student carelessness in running the pub has unfortunately fallen upon this year’s EngSoc executive and although it was perhaps time for a review and subsequent changes, the decision appears to be a rash one. EngSoc’s blunders following the closure are exemplified by its lack of a planning, transparency or any concrete information for concerned stakeholders.,An optimist might hope this fiasco would make student leaders sit up and take notice of their administrative blunders, and motivate them to clean up their act.,A realist might predict they’ll come to the conclusion that it’s easier to pass the buck until a situation like Clark Hall blows up in a student government’s face."},{"title":"Sell with smarts, not sex","url":"/story/2007-09-11/editorials/sell-smarts-not-sex/","date":"September 11, 2007","content":"Everybody knows sex sells. Sexual images and ideas have permeated the advertising industry for decades, and the concern that it objectifies women and devalues sex itself is nothing new. The general lack of progression, however, in minimizing the promiscuity promoted in ads is troubling.,A Bell Canada ad displayed in the men’s and women’s washrooms of the JDUC showed their trademark beaver holding internet installation gear, with the line reading,“There is no shame in an easy hook-up.” On top of offering a decent package deal, Bell is implicitly promoting the idea of a permissive attitude towards casual sex.,The ad is surprising for a number of reasons—Bell, not usually a company associated with sex, has completely consumerized it in an attempt to appeal to a certain demographic.,It also implies a certain assumption about those it’s aimed at because it insinuates they won’t think twice while reading the ad—that is, they aren’t mature enough to realize the implications of an “easy hook-up.”,In doing this, Bell is encouraging a lifestyle that could potentially have unhealthy consequences. It is no coincidence Bell has chosen a university campus to show these ads—it would be overtly inappropriate in any place more public—but it’s disturbing that such a seemingly backwards message could be found nearby signs with conflicting messages such as “Don’t wake up with more than a hangover.”,University campuses are not isolated arenas for such explicit advertising. T-shirts for sale on Toronto streets, plastered with the slogan “Play with girls, not guns!” suggest that instead of engaging in gunplay, one should instead use girls as an object for perhaps equally aggressive acts. It disturbingly propagates issues of sexual violence, objectification of women, and the assignation of male and female roles. The aggression of men is balanced out by the passivity of women, who are essentially likened to toys in this slogan.,Gun violence is a serious problem in the Greater Toronto Area and elsewhere. The idea that these T-shirts will deal with all the issues contributing to shootings and gang violence is simplistic and just plain stupid.,Both the T-shirt and the Bell ad, regardless of their intentions, normalize lifestyles and attitudes with potentially backwards and harmful consequences that should make advertisers think twice before using sex as a gimmick."},{"title":"Less talk, more rock for green office","url":"/story/2007-07-31/editorials/less-talk-more-rock-green-office/","date":"July 31, 2007","content":"In June, Vice-Principal (Operations and Finance) Andrew Simpson announced the University is creating a new sustainability office to oversee environmental initiatives across Queen’s campus.,This office’s creation is a positive step and indicates the University’s intention to accord some attention to sustainability issues. Our concern is that the new office represents a token gesture—a paper tiger intended to create the impression of concern for sustainability issues that have become in vogue.,At its worst, the office could present one more obstacle to implementing sustainable initiatives at Queen’s: In its professed goal to facilitate green plans and centralize all environmental clubs and bodies on campus, it could make itself one more layer of red tape through which students, staff and faculty are obliged to cut in order to make any tangible difference.,If the sustainability office merely creates a green veneer to enhance the University’s image, and if it stymies any real action, it would be a waste of time.,This isn’t inevitable, however. Simpson said he doesn’t want the office to be “another layer of bureaucracy,” and we agree 100 per cent. The sustainability office can be an agent of positive, sustainable change at the University—and we could use one.,Although the University has already budgeted a preliminary $65,000 towards its operation, the sustainability office doesn’t yet have a specific mandate; Simpson said the first task will be to hire a director, and presumably they will go from there.,For the University, and the still-to-be-hired sustainability director, we’ve compiled a wish list:,• Don’t write endless reports and studies; really liaise with existing sustainability groups and all University departments and give them the money and means to accomplish more, faster. Grants would be an excellent idea.,• Team CMM: You called for a sustainability office as one of your campaign platforms, which is great. Don’t lose this momentum, but make this office active and productive.,• Look to other universities: We can learn a lot from schools with successful sustainability offices such as the University of British Columbia.,• Fix the University’s waste disposal and recycling system. Paper still amounts to 36 per cent of our landfill waste; that’s pretty pathetic. Cut down on paper use, increase the amount of waste that’s reused or recycled and establish composts across campus.,• Approach sustainable consumption in a broader sense and ensure the University’s purchasing policies—from food to merchandise to office supplies—are ethical.,If it can ditch the rhetoric and grow some teeth, the new sustainability office can be both productive and proactive."},{"title":"Chantler’s diatribe: hardly harmless","url":"/story/2007-09-14/editorials/chantlers-diatribe-hardly-harmless/","date":"September 14, 2007","content":"There are those who would assert that 21st-century society has taken political correctness too far, extending it to the point at which restrictions on expression become ludicrous.,Diatribe Editor in Chief Gareth Chantler appears to be one of those people. In this week’s Diatribe, Chantler voiced his less-than-impressed opinion on Orientation Week and the way frosh leaders are trained. At one point he targets the alleged inanity of sensitivity training.,His invective was disturbing. Chantler suggested that words like “faggot,” “nigger” and “cunt” are acceptable for regular use and all should be a part of the socialization process for first-years because these words exist in the “real world.” According to Chantler’s column, the way people use and react to such words gauges frosh’s maturity level.,It’s still an unfortunately common occurrence to see the words to which Chantler so glibly refers spray-painted on the walls of homes, businesses and places of worship. Hate-based crimes continue to proliferate: recently, the kidnapping and torture of a 20-year-old black woman in West Virginia was considered by some to be a hate crime. The woman was repeatedly called a racial slur while her captors sexually abused, beat and stabbed her, her mother said. With such obvious examples of the way these words are used to hurt, it’s shocking Chantler can claim they’re no longer potent in that context. By saying words such as “nigger” and “faggot” are simply part of reality, Chantler is perpetuating their colloquial usage. These words remain completely unacceptable in so-called “real” situations.,Not only does Chantler miss the mark in describing a reality that the frosh at Queen’s should expect, his tirade bases itself on a misconstrued perception of what censorship exactly is. When frosh leaders agree not to use offensive terms, they aren’t signing away their right to free speech—refraining from using offensive or discriminatory language doesn’t infringe on people’s right to free speech. Rather, using that terminology would abrogate their right to freedom from discrimination.,Chantler may have chosen to use such inflammatory slurs in order to make his article more sensational and shocking—if this is the case, it has succeeded and perhaps gone further, into the realm of a senseless rant.,Chantler riskily poked at an issue that affects people other than him and chose to ignore the hurtful connotations the proscribed words carry.

Last week, he unveiled his plan to bring faith-based schools into the publicly funded education system. He told reporters he would support these schools teaching creationism and “other theories.” Several hours later, the PC leader backtracked on his remarks qualifying his proposal with the caveat that such theories should be taught only in religion classes.,This isn’t the first time Tory has raised the issue of funding religious schools with private funds— he did so once before in February 2006. Now, as it was then, Tory’s proposal is a mistake both politically and policy-wise.,Over and above the issue’s incendiary nature, it would be ludicrous to implement. What qualifies as a religious school—and how to regulate them—would create a practical nightmare.,Tory’s comments also ignited a debate on the long-standing issue of whether it’s appropriate for the state to fund Catholic schools and not any other religious institutions.,The archaic arrangement was implemented under the British North America Act of 1867, when the Catholic religion was endangered by the powerful Protestant majority, necessitating protection by the state. An historical precedent is no reason to hold onto an outdated policy.,The system presently in place negates the concept of the separation of church and state and discriminates against other religions.,Already there’s stratification simply,because some jurisdictions of Catholic schooling are better funded than others, and the problems associated with the current system would only be exacerbated if more religions were to have their own institutions.,In addition, the new force would lead various parties to lobby to have their religions endowed by the province.,The province’s present arrangement requires a review. Funding of both non-denominational public schools as well as Catholic ones is becoming increasingly difficult to uphold and constitutes an anachronism on its own.,Rather than suitably reflecting Ontario’s growing diversity, Tory’s proposal to publicly fund all religious schools would increase inequalities. To be truly equitable, the province should cut funding to the Catholic school board entirely."},{"title":"Your Big Brother Facebook","url":"/story/2007-06-26/editorials/your-big-brother-facebook/","date":"June 26, 2007","content":"The superspeed e-commercialization of the web can have its ups and downs.,We are living in an age where communication travels at light speed; information is in excess. We’re on the verge of a globalized community that knows no limits through social networking.,Last year, Time magazine named its “Person of the Year” as YOU­—the collective Internet community. In the conscientious eyes of the magazine’s social commentators, we are fondly dubbed as “the YouTube generation”—or “Web 2.0”—where most aspects of our lifestyles, in one way or another, are dependent on online communication or the transfer of digitized information.,However, as with most revolutions of the past, the fruits of our “webvolution” do not come without a cost. Sites on the Internet, in exchange for their services, can record our every activity, content and piece of personal information to minute detail while sharing these resources with commercially vested interests. Facebook, for instance, is an example of our webvolution’s Big Brother trend. Your profile can and display your favourite music, birth date, address, educational history, pictures, sexual orientation, daily schedules, political affiliations and, most recently, a “timestamp” feed that logs your minute-by-minute activity on the site.,And that’s not all. Facebook’s privacy policy also states, “Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the Facebook service.”,So where does this leave room for your privacy?,Facebook’s terms of service additionally grants the company, “irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, perform, display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute [your] information and content and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such information and content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing.” You further grant Facebook the right to share your information with companies with which Facebook has a relationship. Can you think of any marketing company that would pass by this chance of obtaining your detailed information?,We can often lose sight of what we sacrifice in exchange for our own social spotlight on Facebook. I believe Time magazine’s selection was a miss when they spearheaded the collective Internet community as their most influential Person of the Year: we are also the most influenced. Our behaviours and actions are easily swayed by the ongoing market-oriented, pop culture cheese. Our influence upon the market is, in one way or another, the product of the marketplace.,Sites like Facebook should enact a policy that prevents the outside transfer of your personal information.

As graduate and professional enrolment (law in particular) increases, pushing this campus towards a mixture of nearly one-third graduate students, the need for student representation is obvious to all involved. Unfortunately, the current representational structure—made up of the ill-equipped and poorly run Society for Graduate and Professional Studies (SGPS)—has failed to meet the needs of current graduate students, much less those to come.,While the AMS is undoubtedly not without its faults, at the very least the AMS provides its students with useful services and effective representation. In my experience as a student leader, due to a lack of professionalism and follow-through, the SGPS does a poor job of conveying the needs of graduate students to various groups within the University administration.,A large part of the reason that the SGPS is disregarded by the University administration is the fact that they have failed to make good on key promises and commitments—a trait that is extremely damaging to an organization that relies on dealing in good faith with others. For example, while previous SGPS executives had promised the University administration and others that graduate students would contribute to the construction of the Queen’s Centre—a project which undergraduate students selflessly committed $25.5 million dollars—to this date, the SGPS executive hasn’t made a move to make good on this not-insubstantial promise. In fact, in my experience, the SGPS failed to show interest in participating in even the most basic consultations regarding the design and development of the Queen’s Centre, often times failing to provide a person to sit on the requisite committees.,While the SGPS may defend their actions in this regard by claiming that the Queen’s Centre isn’t important to a majority of their constituents (a statement which is short-sighted and gives little credit to the many graduate students who realize the importance of the project to all students), ineffectively dealing with critical issues is a trend which isn’t just limited to dealings with the University. When the AMS made the decision to close After-Hours Childcare in 2005, it was with the knowledge that the majority of student use was from graduates, not undergraduates. However, despite the fact that it was obviously a priority for graduate students to have such a service (demonstrated by the fact that SGPS members were, at the time, paying a fee to support the operation of the childcare service), the SGPS representatives at the time knew little about what After-Hours Childcare was, how it operated or who was using it.,I hope that if nothing else, these people begin to take positions on the SGPS and help transform it into a relevant organization that effectively serves the needs of its student members. It’s only through active participation by more concerned and intelligent individuals that the SGPS can be worth more than the value of a free ISIC card."},{"title":"Lockdown on free speech","url":"/story/2007-06-26/editorials/lockdown-free-speech/","date":"June 26, 2007","content":"Several months ago 15-year-old Grade 10 student Kieran King heard a presentation about drug use in a high-school class. Thinking the presentation poorly researched, King sought out information on the Internet about the relative health risks of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco. He told some of his fellow students marijuana appeared the least hazardous of the three.,One student complained to the principal, who said if she heard him discussing marijuana again she would call the police. King felt his right to free speech was being impeded and with the help of the Saskatchewan Marijuana Party, he organized a walkout at his school last Tuesday. Just before the walkout was set to take place, the principal ordered a school lockdown.,King and his brother left the school to join five other people protesting outside. The RCMP was called in to regulate the protest of seven people, King and his brother were suspended and the school performed a threat assessment on King, which revealed he had mentioned marijuana five or six times in the last year. King maintains he’s never even seen or smoked marijuana.,Because he was suspended, King was unable to write his exams and received marks of zero. The drop in marks may hurt his chances of getting a university scholarship.,The principal’s overreaction to King’s discussion of marijuana violated his right to freedom of speech. Calling in the RCMP to manage a peaceful walkout was unnecessary and ridiculous. The principal’s unwillingness to confront the issue in an academic setting is a weak attempt to stamp out what could have been an informed, intellectual and relevant discussion.,The school administrators’ reaction is also counterintuitive to their role as educators. They should be concerned with what students are asking and take what their students say seriously.,King’s punishment should fit his alleged crime. Being suspended for protesting the school’s crackdown on his right to freedom of speech and being prevented from writing his exams as a result could drastically impact his future.,Are we to understand that children aren’t afforded the right to discussion on topics of their choosing, particularly when they’ve researched and can defend their arguments?,King wasn’t armed or dangerous.

It’s shocking that a newspaper that claims to report the facts with integrity would also print jokes offensive to a wide range of people and jeopardize the trust administrators and peers place in all student journalists. Thanks to their actions, student journalists must now work even harder to demonstrate that they can be taken seriously and produce critically engaging work.,In response to the Gazette’s parody issue, Western’s student government implemented a code of ethics and an advisory board comprised of Gazette alumni and industry professionals to review the newspaper’s conduct. At the end of each year, the administration will have the power to revoke the paper’s $9 mandatory fee and suspend its distribution privileges if they deem the conduct inappropriate.,Granting administration the power to effectively terminate the paper displays a misconception of a campus newspaper’s role. A newspaper doesn’t need an advisory board to ensure its printed content is true, and creation of the board could eliminate the potential for critical analysis of the university. As well, it sets a dangerous precedent with which other student newspapers may have to contend.,The administration and student government should take a hard look at their community, instead of impeding the progress of their student newspaper and next year’s editorial board. An advisory board will not address the attitudes of individuals in their community who condone and appreciate the offensive material printed in the issue.,Instead of targeting this as an isolated incident and creatting a board with conflicting external interests, the administration should focus on improvements needed in their community and its attitudes towards offensive material, not the media body whose ignorance reflects those attitudes."},{"title":"A call for tuition transparency","url":"/story/2007-03-23/editorials/call-tuition-transparency/","date":"March 23, 2007","content":"David Giglio, Comm ’09, recently discovered a major discrepancy in fees when signing up for an arts and science course.,Commerce students are required to take a certain number of elective credits in arts and science.

In order to raise awareness about what he perceived to be a major inequality, Giglio started a petition and received over 200 signatures on his first day. Peter Kissick, director of the commerce program explained, “the fees commerce students pay are for the whole program—and the whole experience of being a commerce student—not just individual courses.\",Evidently, extra funds are required of business students to cover the costs of certain amenities afforded to them as members of the commerce faculty; however, these costs should be part of their student fees rather than added to the price of arts and science courses. The current system is confusing and only perpetuates the stratified culture among students in different fields of the University. Even simply from an optical perspective, having commerce students pay twice as much as arts and science students for the same course encourages the culture of elitism which already exists.,Giglio’s campaign illustrates why the University needs to be more transparent with how they allocate tuition money .Students should know where and how their tuition dollars are being spent.,There’s currently a disconnect between what students in each faculty are charged in tuition and where the money is going in their faculty.

At that point, students only had one day’s notice.,Although the date for accepting motions was extended, there’s no reason why students should have been given such late notice in the first place.,It seems as if Macmillan and the AMS Commission of Internal Affairs simply assumed average students would be too busy or apathetic to care. But that wasn’t the case when the AMS needed students to pass the Queen’s Centre motion.,Two years ago, when the AMS needed student support in order to pass the Queen’s Centre motion, they embarked on a lengthy and expensive advertising campaign, complete with full-spread advertisements in the Journal weeks in advance and gigantic posters and banners around campus, to get their message out. The result was a packed Grant Hall full of passionate students on both sides of the debate. This year, in contrast, there wasn’t even quorum. Of the required 100 students, only 65 were in attendance. The AMS’s cavalier “Don’t call us, we’ll call you” attitude smacks of complacency and elitism and is an affront to the democratic processes of our student government.,The AGM is one of the only times during the school year when students can come forward, vote, and have a say in what their student government does.

The protesting student politicians were nonchalant about their actions when interviewed by The Globe, failing to see anything wrong with what they did. But kudos to Paul Knox, chair of Ryerson’s journalism program, who told The Globe: “In other contexts, the consequences can be quite severe because it casts the whole business of news reporting into disrepute.”,They showed a complete lack of respect for journalism and a disregard for the potential damage the incident may cause to the long-term relationships between campus newspapers, local governments and student unions.,Not only that, considering the size and political clout of the three Toronto universities, chances are the student union presidents could have arranged a face-to-face meeting with Bentley to rationally discuss\ntheir concerns, especially if they showed they were unified on certain issues.

Campus Security also sent this information to Dean of Student Affairs Jason Laker, whose office forwarded it to Judicial Committee (JComm) Chief Prosecutor Jenn Mansell.,Last Wednesday, an emergency AMS Assembly meeting was called to discuss the issue. At the meeting, the AMS passed a motion condemning the Dean’s office for its actions “with regard to the collection of information on off-campus student activity” and the “sharing of this information with non-Queen’s bodies,” presumably referring to the police.,First of all, Laker shouldn’t have sent this list to Mansell. It’s obvious the information would put her in a compromising position as JComm chief prosecutor; she should have no prior knowledge of incidents that could potentially come up at JComm. However, although Laker’s actions showed poor judgment, it was done in good faith—to warn students.,The AMS overreacted by calling an emergency meeting instead of talking to Laker. It was a rash decision that only created more confusion and unnecessary panic.

The suggestion that notifying the police about possible keg parties is a violation of privacy is completely false, as events posted on Facebook are in the public realm—anyone can read what’s posted. Campus Security doesn’t actively investigate students but they are obligated to respond to complaints and all it would take for them to catch wind of these keggers would be a neighbour, student or otherwise, to give them a call telling them they suspect an illegal party will be taking place on a certain date. Students shouldn’t be surprised if Campus Security uses every means available to them—including Facebook—to investigate the complaints they receive.,All the AMS’s garbage about in loco parentis is defensive hyperbole.

What students can do without being reprimanded isn’t very clear when the only determining factors are vague phrases about “affecting the Queen’s reputation.” If JComm is only concerned with prosecuting events connected with Homecoming because of the negative attention it draws to the University, the members don’t appear to be concerned with non-academic discipline at all, but rather just preserving the University’s image and reputation.

Some of the cards are posted on the project’s blog, and some are printed in his series of books.,Often, I feel as though I can relate to the secrets expressed on those cards, and I’m sure some of the other thousands of daily visitors to the blog can as well. Last night was no exception, and although I don’t have a million reasons—just a few—that card pinpointed my sentiments about Valentine’s Day.,Every year, Feb. 14 comes around and, regardless of whether I’m in a relationship or enjoying time on my own, my shoulders tense up a little and my outlook that day is a little darker.,The excessive commercialization of religious holidays, including Christmas, Hanukkah, Easter and virtually every other holiday, religious or otherwise, has been discussed to death. But I’m describing my reasons for hating on Valentine’s Day, and it’s worth mentioning. As a child, I delighted in carefully writing out a valentine card for all the 30 or so kids in my class. Our teachers gave us cinnamon hearts and little candy with sayings like “Be Mine” written on them, that always tasted like chalk.

Isn’t that what anniversaries are for? Don’t get me wrong, I’m not down on love. I love love. I just don’t need Hallmark and everyone else telling me specifically when to show it.

But I think all the jay-walking in this little community is the result of pedestrians outnumbering cars.,In some ways, the jaywalking that makes Queen’s students notorious around Kingston is the natural way of things. In a tiny group of blocks where there are far more walkers than drivers, it makes sense that those without cars should have spatial priority. Unfortunately, our society—and our campus—have pledged their allegiance to suburban car culture, and privilege that lifestyle over the walker. Even the green, supposedly pedestrian-friendly spaces, such as the area around the Medical Quadrangle and Theological Hall, are unnecessarily paved and invaded, and Union Street is being widened to allow more traffic. Recently, street sections closed off for Queen’s Centre construction have given the pavement back to the people. Though the walk may be interrupted by chain-link fence and punctuated by drilling and bulldozers, having open, traffic-free spaces is an opportunity to see what it would be like if we closed all of the streets between University and Barrie—a quieter, healthier environment that I think would inspire creative answers to the question: What do we do with our land if we don’t give it away to cars?,Maybe I sound like I’m just too small-town for all of this big-city noise.,Then again, even in the big city, people have been raising a ruckus for quieter streets. In Toronto’s Kensington Market, on the last Sunday of summer months, Pedestrian Sundays make the neighbourhood car-free for a day. Others in the city have taken to creating “parking meter parties,” where a group descends on a street, buys up all the time in the parking meters, lays down sod and sets up lawn chairs and barbecues in an effort to take back public space from cars.,In addition to thinking outside the box of the environmentally destructive car culture, this type of movement also has a spiritual effect. The world looks different without cars; it’s inherently slower-paced, healthier and builds real community between people.,Imagine what the University could look like without the destructive presence of cars.

And I have recently discovered the common thread linking my vast array of interests: I’m not happy unless I’m competing.,After the latest round of an ongoing debate with a fellow Journal kid, I decided it was time to find out what it is that compels me to constantly measure my progress against that of the people around me. I came to the conclusion that there is nothing so singularly beneficial to the world than the impulse to be the best.,It has long been accepted that competition is a healthy and even necessary part of a child’s development and, despite my colleague’s vehement arguments, there is nothing inherently antagonistic about the principle of competition. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the verb “to compete” derives from the Latin verb competere. The prefix com-, meaning together, combined with the verb petere, meaning to aim at or strive for, means competition is just the desire of two parties to\nachieve greater heights.,Take the newspaper business. The perpetual competition for more depth, more accuracy and more interesting stories has led to the virtually non-stop flow of news available to the public. The constant striving of reporters to dig deeper than their competitor has also dramatically increased the transparency of government organizations such as the military. During the Vietnam War, reporters from the New York Times, the Associated Press, the Washington Post and others worked side by side, challenging each other to reveal the government’s plans and actions, forcing leaders to take responsibility for the consequences.,It’s competition in business that drives the economy. Competition in academia forces universities to raise their standards, challenging students and professors to meet them.,And far from pushing people apart, some of the most inspiring instances of human unity have come out of competition. The Olympic Games, arguably the greatest athletic contest on Earth, is a perfect example. At the 2006 Winter Games, two separate teams competed under the names South Korea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. But during the opening ceremonies, both teams marched\ntogether under one flag, the Korean Unification flag, in the Parade of Nations. They were able to put aside generations of animosity and violence, if only for a few weeks, for the sake of honouring the tradition of something bigger. Granted, there are a few exceptions to the rule. In such fields as medical research, the sharing of findings is crucial to the speed of development of new medications.,But the impulse to work towards faster, more effective and less expensive solutions is ever present.,So the next time you’re playing shinny and someone asks you why you want to keep score, just tell them the future of the world is at stake."},{"title":"The benefits of co-operation","url":"/story/2007-03-16/editorials/benefits-co-operation/","date":"March 16, 2007","content":"From about 1993 to 1999, my relationship with my brother was defined by competition.,The two of us would compete to see who could stuff the most grapes in his or her mouth, who could hold his or her breath the longest and who could run along the most driftwood logs without falling off.,Daniel and I eventually outgrew this phase, however, and it’s a good thing that most adults are able to do so: if such historical partners as Watson and Crick and Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin had felt the same need to place competition over all else, humankind would be much worse off for it.,My esteemed colleague saw fit to bring our running debate to the fray of signed editorials last week and in the interest of friendly exchange of ideas, I figured it would be only fair if I were to do the same. To argue that competition is inherently negative or hostile would be too simplistic; however, I refuse to countenance the assertion that the whole of human achievement stems from competition: in my mind, the opposite is the case. One thing I’ve learned from working at this paper is the way co-operation trumps competition in journalism: the workings of a newspaper depend on the ability of each individual involved in the process to work in sync with one another—the moment one person decides to go it on his or her own, to compete with fellow journalists and approach an article, section or photo from a purely selfpromoting and self-interested perspective, things fall apart.,To deny that competition exists in journalism would be a gross fallacy; to postulate that this competition is ultimately beneficial, however, is crap. In an environment in which people expect to get their news now, if not five minutes ago, all news sources are under pressure to produce results before their competitors, and to make their product easily accessible to what is the lowest common denominator.,This induced competition compromises the quality of the work produced, to say nothing of the deleterious effect of the hypercompetitive atmosphere among individual reporters jockeying for a story. Another easily visible arena of competition is higher education: last summer’s brouhaha over Maclean’s university rankings, and the decision by 22 Canadian universities to drop out, exhibited all the maturity and circumspection of a frustrated six-year-old, and made all parties involved look woefully petty. As students, we’re constantly encouraged to measure ourselves against others based on our marks, convinced that getting higher grades than the next guy is the key to success. I’ve seen first-hand the debilitating effect this competition for marks can have on a student, both in my own experience and from watching my closest friends struggle towards benchmarks set by others, constantly comparing themselves unfavourably to their peers. Far from having a healthy influence on\na person, this competition causes stress and self-disgust and subverts the purpose of higher education: to learn.,So, the next time someone makes fun of you for refusing to race to the end of the block, just tell them you’re trying to save your sanity and make the world a better place."},{"title":"V is for Victory","url":"/story/2007-03-23/editorials/v-victory/","date":"March 23, 2007","content":"In a few short weeks, my five-year Queen’s career will finally limp to a close. I’ll have a three-year degree, the possible beginnings of an incredibly low-paying but satisfying career completely unrelated to said degree, financial independence and something a lot of students don’t have when they graduate: their virginity.,Whether it’s a spiritual choice, or an involuntary failure to be in the right place at the right time with the right person, many people find virginity past “a certain age” as perverse as hearing 13-year-olds in the back of the bus rating their blowjobs—just at the opposite end of the freak spectrum. But being a virgin hasn’t ruined my life, nor has it caused my genitals to wither and fall off from disuse.,One reason being a virgin in college can be uncomfortable is that people in the same boat are often too ashamed to talk about it. So to go out with a bang having never banged, here are some things I would have liked to hear other students admit while I was at school:,That there are many students who aren’t having sex, and it’s not necessarily because they’re physically malformed, socially inept, or crazy (even if I’ve been accused of all three). That you are not the only one experiencing brief hallucinations that the ’s Love and Sex Supplement carries the parenthetical subtitle (Neither of Which You Have, By The Way). That as the years tick by and you become a sexual statistical outlier, it’s difficult not to notice how phallic-looking normal distributions are.,That you might have to listen to all of the housemates you ever share a wall with having sex, and have to be OK with that, and should probably invest in good headphones. That your housemate might Google “famous virgins” and be disappointed that Isaac Newton’s appearance on the list does not console you. That people will expect you to be embarrassed about your “condition” and be embarrassed for you, regardless of how you actually feel.,That you will be the only one of your friends who sobers up during games of “Never Have I Ever,” while your drink reaches room temperature and your lucidity causes you to retain more information about their bedroom/camping/train adventures than you ever wanted.,That nurses who don’t want to test you for mono will try to convince you that you’re fatigued by early pregnancy, despite all evidence to the contrary. That a lot of people won’t understand or believe that not having sex isn’t denying that you’re a sexual being. That it’s sometimes awkward, sometimes painful, sometimes a relief and often not even a conscious concern. That you may cringe during phone calls from your mother when she asks you if “you have any sexy panties … just in case.”,So if you feel like I feel, you don’t have to get it on—you just have to graduate and figure out what to do with the rest of your life. And it’s awfully hard to get your pants off while rocking back and forth in fetal position, so don’t rush either decision."},{"title":"The skill behind fine art","url":"/story/2007-03-02/editorials/skill-behind-fine-art/","date":"March 2, 2007","content":"A friend of mine once told me of a spat she had with a close friend who had mocked her need to work hard and study seriously as a music student. Although he had meant it in a joking manner, my friend was indignant about his attitude and how the comment is a reflection of a common misconception\ntowards the arts.,As a Chinese-Canadian in a research-driven university such as Queen’s, I can hardly blame the confusion and disbelief of people when they find out that I study fine arts. While the first question is usually whether or not my parents are OK with my choice, the point here isn’t concerning the Asian stereotype.,The next most popular questions are the following: “So … what … what is it that you do?!” or “So … you paint … whatever you want?” I want to vindicate the study of fine arts, and shed some light\non what we actually do. Although the term “fine arts” can usually entail anything from music, dance and drama to the visual arts, digital media and film, at Queen’s, it’s focused on the visual art spectrum. That said, the BFA program is composed of four studio streams: painting, sculpture, printmaking and time-based media (i.e., video work mainly), all of which fine arts students are required to take in their first and second year.,However, what most people don’t know about our program is the amount of work and stamina it actually requires. Paintings for example—if you think they’re all fun and games, think again. Queen’s BFA students have one of the highest critical studies to studio class ratios in Canada. So besides\nour mandatory studio class of 12 hours per week (Monday to Thursday, three hours each day), don’t forget the load of art history, or the additional twelve hours per week of individual studio work, or the woodshop hours to make our eight-by-four foot canvas stretchers from scratch. But that’s just a\nminimum commitment, minus our electives. To be fair, I generally finish the fall and winter terms early with few exam-period finals. But remember, that just means all hell breaks loose at the close of classes. Take my third-year painting course last term (equivalent to three classes), for example, in which three months’ worth of painting was due on the last day of classes only to be judged for 100 per cent of our final mark (minus class attendance). In some of my peers’ cases, they also had take-home or in-class exams to juggle with at the same time.,Making art is like writing a meaningful personal essay. It means hours of editing, deleting, polishing, and there’s no instruction manual or rigid textbook telling you exactly what to do. It’s the endless choices that drive me nuts.,I guess what I want to say is that it’s not easy studying art. Forget about the misunderstood-artist-angst thing; instead, it’s difficult because fine art students still need to think and analyze critically, which in my opinion is the point of a university education. Or, I can just make things look pretty—but\nwhat’s my reasoning behind that?"},{"title":"Tenure shouldn’t grant immunity","url":"/story/2007-03-30/editorials/tenure-shouldnt-grant-immunity/","date":"March 30, 2007","content":"Last fall, tenured psychology professor Brian Butler had an argument with his neighbour regarding a disputed willow tree on one of their properties—an argument that resulted in Butler hitting his neighbour with a 24-foot ladder, grabbing his neighbour’s neck and threatening him. Butler has since been charged with assault with a weapon and uttering threats, although his guilt has yet to be proven in court.,Under current tenure provisions, dismissal can only occur as a result of three causes: gross misconduct, incompetence or persistent neglect of academic duties. The six-year process of achieving tenure, meant to protect freedom of speech and intellectual pursuit, also protects professors from being fired from their positions because this could be construed as an infringement of those freedoms.,This case highlights tenure as a flawed system in need of review. For one, there should be clearer definitions of what criminal charges would be considered gross misconduct and therefore grounds for dismissal.,In the private sector, a major difference of opinion between an employee and his or her boss may result in termination; in the academic realm, it’s necessary to ensure some sort of protection so professors can express divergent views. That said, the purpose of tenure is not to protect professors who attack their neighbours. Tenure should not give professors a licence to commit crimes without facing any professional consequences.,Students must go through a non-academic discipline system for violating the University’s Code of Conduct, so it’s surprising that the process for faculty isn’t based on the same principles.,If professors are being disciplined for external actions that may affect their employment at the University, it would be nice to see a greater effort for accountability and more open disciplinary procedures, as well as a clearer definition of what constitutes gross misconduct, incompetence and neglect of academic duties.,Professors interact with students on a one-on-one basis, so it’s problematic that the University isn’t more concerned with one of its professors showing signs of violent behaviour. We hope students and faculty will voice their concerns regarding the protection of Butler’s status so that disciplinary measures are considered during his yearly review."},{"title":"Students & Lam need to learn from Cockroach","url":"/story/2007-03-23/editorials/students-and-lam-need-learn-cockroach/","date":"March 23, 2007","content":"Last Friday, Phil Lam was awarded the Golden Cockroach—for the second year in a row. But this year, not only did Lam win the top prize, he also received all of the positions on the infamous Golden Cockroach podium.,The Key to the Ghetto Award and the Golden Cockroach Award, given to the best and worst student landlords respectively, is one of the better ideas to come out of the AMS in recent years and hopefully it will continue to be awarded. It would be more effective if the award was handed out earlier, though, perhaps before the winter break. By holding the awards just before the traditional house-hunting season, the Golden Cockroach would have a greater influence on students looking to sign a new lease.,Although the condition of 286 Queen Street—Lam’s Cockroach-winning house which graced the cover of last week’s Journal—and Lam’s other nominated properties are inexcusable, it’s unfortunate that students signed the lease in the first place. As we’ve stated in these pages on numerous occasions—there is no housing shortage. But that doesn’t stop Lam and other landlords from perpetuating this misinformation and intimidating students to sign sub-standard living spaces. Lam told the Journal by e-mail that he believes the service he offers is as good as any other landlord in Kingston, “It’s just that I have so many more apartments that there may well be complaints from a very small minority not reflective of the rest of my tenants.” If he has too many properties to ensure they are all being maintained to legal standards then he should consider scaling back so he can do his job—properly.,Peter Holmes, who was nominated for the Golden Cockroach last year, showed a vast improvement since then and it’s evident that he took the criticism as a serious message from students that it was time for a change. This year, he was nominated again—for the Key to the Ghetto.,Although landlords have a legal obligation to maintain their properties, students must also take responsibility to protect themselves against negligence. It’s important to know what the law is and to know what rights are guaranteed to you as tenants under the  Residential Tenancies Act. Many landlords won’t initiate change without educated tenants who are willing to question or challenge them to enforce their legal rights. And Kingston’s property standards office can only respond if they receive a complaint.,Students need to empower themselves against bad landlords by taking advantage of the available resources and standing up for their rights as tenants. The student mindset that it’s OK to live in poor housing needs to change, and hopefully the continuation of the Golden Cockroach will remind landlords that they can’t treat students like second-class citizens. But we need to do our part too."},{"title":"Studio Q’s stability","url":"/story/2007-03-09/editorials/studio-qs-stability/","date":"March 9, 2007","content":"Last Week, the AMS board of directors passed a motion, put forward by current Studio Q business manager Jess Lindal, to change the hiring process for Studio Q’s executive producer. Rather than being elected by Studio Q’s contributors, the executive producer will now be hired by an AMS panel consisting of the services director responsible for Studio Q, the incoming VP (operations) and a permanent staff member.,The hiring panel will consult with a member of Studio Q on technical matters. The changes in hiring were sparked by two previous years of acclaimed elections and the difficulties Studio Q had with\nmaintaining stability and consistency through yearly turnovers as well as their inability to attract new members.,When last year’s executive producer and business manager both quit at the beginning of the term, Lindal had to rebuild Studio Q from the ground up. She has now realized that the group requires the intervention of a larger body. Although it seems as if Studio Q had little choice but to seek help from outside of their service, we can’t help but look at this as a blow to editorial autonomy for student journalism and as a sad day for campus media in general.,But the service’s lack of concern for their editorial autonomy at the moment is overshadowed by the fact that they appear unable to turn the service around on their own. It’s an unfortunate last resort, but we can only hope that the AMS influence will give Studio Q the overhaul it needs and will give new executive producers the resources to hire or put themselves out in a way that attracts new student volunteers.,With an external AMS hiring panel, Studio Q may be able to appeal to a broader audience, although they may find it difficult to regain their autonomy and return to internal elections once they are back on their feet and can appreciate the value of the independence they are now sacrificing. Although they appear out of other options, it’s uncertain whether having the AMS appoint the next producer will change any lack of commitment and direction seen in recent years or will do anything to improve their ability to attract volunteers. If Studio Q is to be seen as a legitimate media outlet on campus they should focus more on providing relevant broadcast journalism to the Queen’s community, which\nwould require a dramatic shift from their current direction.,Although having an outlet to practice writing, film-making and editing provides valuable experience to students, in its current state, Studio Q would be better as a club or extension of the film department.,Until Studio Q can more clearly define its mandate and become more relevant to students, AMS assistance is useless. The service has the potential to function as so much more than just a series of short skits, but the changes that are required need to come from within. The Journal, for one, would welcome the competition."},{"title":"Think twice, U.S. bashers","url":"/story/2007-02-16/editorials/think-twice-us-bashers/","date":"February 16, 2007","content":"Last week, I watched the Cuban ambassador to Canada address a crowd of Queen’s students and other Kingstonians. Although his speech was mostly about Cuban-Canadian relations, he offered\na few choice words about the United States.,While he’s not exactly happy about the relationship, or lack thereof, between Cuba and the U.S., he has nothing against the American people themselves, he said. He knows that many of them don’t agree with their government’s policies in regards to Cuba and he holds nothing against them.,His words about separating the state from the society rang true with me. Despite having lived in the\ncountry for over 10 years, I’ve always steadfastly refused to identify myself as an American.,I was born in Canada, and have always been proud to be Canadian. My only motivation for becoming an American citizen is so that I would be able to cast a vote against the current government.,However, it still annoys me to no end when I hear people speak disparagingly about the U.S. because more often than not, the comments seem to be a generalized collection of uninformed stereotypes.,Don’t get me wrong: If you have an intelligent critique of the current government’s policies, I’m all ears. Directing your dislike of the American government onto the entire population, however, is misinformed and ignorant.,If you’re going to tell me how all Americans are ignorant, superficial, stupid, ugly and/or rude, let me pre-empt your incredibly bigoted statement by saying this: you’re wrong. Not all Americans are flag-waving, gun-toting Republicans. I’ve never seen a restaurant that serves “freedom fries.” Not everyone is an overweight, McDonald’s-eating glutton. Not everyone supports the war in Iraq. Many Americans are well aware that the entire universe doesn’t revolve around them. Being American doesn’t mean you are a consumer-driven capitalist who thinks only of making a profit, regardless of the cost to others or the world at large. Not all Americans are loud, obnoxious and insensitive.,It’s frustrating to listen to someone start saying “all Americans are so stupid because …” only to see the annoyed look on my face and correct themselves.,“Oh, you don’t count. You’re not actually American,” they say, like it’s okay to make such an ignorant statement as long as they aren’t insulting me directly. But it’s still an insulting comment and it still offends me on behalf of all the Americans who don’t fit the stereotype. It’s not acceptable to make overarching stereotypes about races or religions, and it’s rare to hear someone broadly insulting the entire population of other countries. It boggles me, then, when I hear otherwise intelligent and culturally aware individuals making rude, generalizing comments about the U.S., like it’s somehow okay, just because it’s the U.S.,It’s not OK. Say what you will about the government, its institutions and its policies. But please, think twice before commenting on the character of the entire population."},{"title":"Sweating over athletic apparel","url":"/story/2007-03-02/editorials/sweating-over-athletic-apparel/","date":"March 2, 2007","content":"This past summer, Queen’s signed a $200,000, three-year contract with Russell Athletic which made them the “exclusive supplier of athletic apparel” to the University.,Among other factories, Russell outsourced some of its apparel production to Hermosa Manufacturing, a factory located in Apopa, El Salvador. According to a complaint made by a German NGO to the Fair Labor Association in December 2005, the Hermosa factory was abruptly closed in May 2005, leaving 320 factory workers suddenly unemployed with no severance pay, unpaid overtime work and outstanding unpaid wages.,In November of this year, students from Queen’s No Sweat raised concerns about the enforcement of ethical labour laws in the company, with particular reference to the El Salvador factory, and met with Principal Karen Hitchcock and Dean of Student Affairs Jason Laker.,Russell Athletic claims to be looking into the situation but says they aren’t responsible because the dispute in El Salvador is a domestic issue. Queen’s No Sweat wants the University to adopt a designated suppliers program (DSP), an initiative of the Workers’ Rights Consortium, which would require the University to source most of their logo apparel from supplier factories that are determined\nby the consortium to be in compliance with ethical labour laws.,The program would be gradually phased in over a number of years. While more than 30 American universities have agreed to adopt the DSP, Queen’s administration has so far been reluctant to sign in, citing “cumbersome” implementation as the main obstacle. Jason Laker also suggested that because the DSP only applies to apparel purchases, it is somehow not fair because the University doesn’t maintain the same purchasing standards for other products.,Come on. First of all, you have to start somewhere; and second of all, the nature of the garment industry requires strict ethical regulations. And contrary to popular myth, enforcing ethical labour standards will not result in dramatic increases in costs, one of the other concerns raised by the administration.,The University needs to be more proactive in doing better background checks on the companies they deal with before signing contracts. They should have asked more questions in the Russell deal.,Laker may be right to suggest that implementing the DSP may be “very cumbersome,” but that doesn’t mean it isn’t the right thing to do. Universities should be expected to lead the way in social justice movements such as this one because they are not—at least in theory—profit-driven institutions."},{"title":"Darts & laurels 2006-07","url":"/story/2007-04-05/editorials/darts-and-laurels-2006-07/","date":"April 5, 2007","content":"Darts,The Other Campaign\nUnfortunately, the members of this campaign have done more harm than good for their cause by alienating potential allies and discrediting alternative politics on a campus that could desperately use alternative politics.,Vice-Principal (Operations and Finance) Andrew Simpson, and anyone else at this University who accepted a position of authority and responsibility yet refused to do in-person interviews\nIt’s part of your job to answer questions, especially when making important decisions that affect students.,The New Kingston Recycling Program\nThe Ghetto has never been dirtier because the limitations have served to actually discourage recycling due to unrealistic restrictions for student living.,The petty election drama between Nathaniel Erksine-Smith and Alex Huntley\nGrow up.,Delayed investigation into Sukaina Ali’s death\nVice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane should have tried to stick to his timelines and promises—especially as they were his creation in the first place.,“Think you need experience?

The e-mail was sent from sicreview@gmail.com. Despite attempts to contact the authors, the Journal has yet to receive a response. Lauzon, who is responsible for hearing grievances related to hiring, has said no formal complaints have been filed with her office.,The problems with the petition are many. Its anonymity aside, the vague accusations, without ever making any specific complaints, are confusing and unproductive at best and inflammatory and destructive at worst. Other than defaming Brown, what is accomplished by lashing out with anonymous, inarticulate and vague accusations? And the claim that “there is no official appeal process” is just plain false. Although the e-mail sparked some conversation among students, it mostly consisted of trying to understand what the petitioners wanted. The commission’s hiring practices are not being examined in a productive manner. To truly effect change, the groups need to start by working through the channels that exist and filing a legitimate complaint. Recently, there appears a growing trend towards the use of anonymity by students on campus. Instead of fully committing themselves to a cause and making themselves accountable to their words and actions, students are choosing to hide behind various modes of anonymous expression—a method used both by some members of the Other Campaign and the writers criticizing AMS hiring decisions. Not only do these irresponsible actions lack ntegrity, they also do nothing for constructive debate.,The Journal encourages the authors of the petition to write a signed letter to the editor clarifying their concerns and specifying the “questionable hiring practices” of the AMS.,We’d be more than happy to publish it."},{"title":"Reinforcing stereotypes","url":"/story/2007-02-16/editorials/reinforcing-stereotypes/","date":"February 16, 2007","content":"In Tuesday’s issue of the Journal, a full page advertisement for Queen’s Multicultural Festival appeared on the inside back cover—and we’re baffled by it. Not only is it impossible to understand the advertisement, which states, “I am unique because … I started a Tony Danza fan club in high school,” it also seems to be mocking itself. Perhaps the message is that culture is whatever makes one unique? If this is the case, the Queen’s Multicultural Festival (QMF) is trivializing the fact that there are serious cultural issues on this campus, and ignoring deeper issues of racism and prejudice. Or maybe it’s some crude joke, made to draw awareness to the “culture of whiteness” by mocking what it means to be different?,At best, the advertisement is inarticulate and clumsy; at worst, it’s insensitive and counterproductive.,The festival is being organized by the Queen’s Multicultural Festival Committee, a new education awareness committee under the AMS Social Issues Commission (SIC), and according to the SIC website, “The Festival will be a week-long celebration of the variety of groups represented at Queen’s. [It] will be an extremely inclusive event that will invite all different types of cultures to participate ... religious, cultural, queer and beyond.” Unfortunately, the festival’s advertisement that was published and posted around campus will only further exclude those students at Queen’s who already feel like they are marginalized.,Although this is a small committee, their actions reflect on the entire University—especially since the lack of ethnic diversity at Queen’s is such a hot-button issue. Regardless of the committee’s intentions, this advertisement reflects poorly on all members of the University, and frankly, is pretty embarrassing.,This festival requires a more substantial exploration of cultures and problems at Queen’s in order to avoid stereotyping and trivializing the issues, or reducing them to items like food and clothing. It also must avoid putting a fixed definition on people’s cultures and in turn ignoring the challenges of ethnicity that cannot be categorized.,Celebrating multiculturalism at Queen’s is extremely important, and if done properly, can be an excellent way to introduce students to different groups on campus. Hopefully this festival will prove to be more sensitive than their advertisements have been, and will showcase cultures in a way that will do more than just reinforce existing stereotypes."},{"title":"Apathy & acclamations","url":"/story/2007-01-30/editorials/apathy-and-acclamations/","date":"January 30, 2007","content":"There’s nothing new about voter apathy—or student apathy in general for that matter—but the number of acclamations and the general lack of candidates in this year’s student government elections is disappointing. With acclamations in ASUS and CESA, nobody running for COMPSA vice-president positions and only two AMS executive campaigns (though it may be difficult to tell them apart), there isn’t much choice for students.,This year, the AMS Commission of Internal Affairs decided to shorten the campaign period from 14 to 10 days. It’s not plainly clear why this decision was made but Chief Returning Officer Ilana Ludwin said it was in order to standardize the campaign periods of students campaigning to get referendum questions passed, and students campaigning for AMS executive positions. But could the decision have been made because of disorganization? Shortening the campaign period will only breed more ignorance among the student body because students will have fewer days to get to know the candidates for whom they will be voting.,Some faculty societies have also shown a distressing lack of competence in managing their own elections. For example, at press time, the Phys-Ed Students Association still hadn’t figured out when their elections will happen. Faculty societies would benefit from having the AMS take over the managing of their elections, like the AMS did for the MCRC in 2004-05.,Maybe it’s just that most students don’t feel inspired or even affected by the AMS and other student governments. Maybe they feel they can better engage with their community and fellow students by other means. Although possibly due to a cyclic slump, this year’s more pronounced apathy could\nbe due to a lack of voice and leadership from team MBT.

Fortunately, you don’t have to take it. But it’s your responsibility to do something about it.,Many students believe they need to settle for dilapidated houses—either fearing that they won’t find anything better, or believing that it’s part of the Queen’s experience. Well, delude yourselves no further. There isn’t a housing shortage, and—as tenants—students have more power over their landlords than they may think.,This may be your first time renting, which makes it especially important not to rush into any decisions.

By September 2006, there were 400 rooms still available for rent. There’s no need to panic, or to allow a housing shortage “myth” to rush you into a decision you may soon regret. Taking the time to make informed decisions now will save a ton of time, energy and stress in future years.,For those upper-year students who have already decided to forgo the house hunt and remain in their Ghettohouse for another faithful year, it’s important to make use of the resources available to help you\nenforce property standards and ensure your landlord is held accountable. One useful group available to assist students is the AMS’s Student Property Assessment Team, who will visit houses, upon equest, and ensure living conditions are in accordance with the city’s bylaws. It’s important that students take advantage of this (and other) free resources if they feel their house is not up to the city’s—or their—standards.,Out of all the complaints the Kingston property standards office receives, the fewest for a house’s interior come from the Ghetto. Other Kingston residents are taking initiative, and students can no longer expect landlords and the city to enforce property standards for them—if you’re unhappy, be pro-active and take charge of your living arrangements.,Students can often be heard complaining of the city’s property standards, but the standards aren’t the problem; the standards are there, and so are the means of enforcement—students simply aren’t using\nthem.

Lemkow undertook diligent research to find that the University’s royal charter technically allows for the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, as the Queen’s representative, to appoint members to the board; practically speaking, however, this iscompletely unfeasible.,If Lemkow’s only intention was to raise awareness about the lack of student representation on the Board of Trustees, then he somewhat succeeded, and could be commended for that. But if he actually sought to achieve greater representation on the board, then he showed a considerable lack of practical judgment.,Although the charter states that the Lieutenant Governor may appoint up to four members, this privilege has never been exercised. It’s no wonder the question was rejected. There are three students on the Board of Trustees: an undergraduate student representative, a graduate student representative and the rector. One voice to represent all undergraduate students is nowhere near enough.,With 44 total board members, a few more students won’t result in any shift in power, but it will provide the board with more diversity of opinion and a few more members who are in touch with\nwhat is actually going on, on campus. Given that students running for office virtually always talk about the need for increased student representation on theUniversity’s decision-making bodies, it’s regrettable that the only action taken in this regard was a poorly planned—if well-intentioned—proposed referendum question. If students really want to make a difference, they should tackle ractical action on this idea rather than merely pay it incessant lip service."},{"title":"A suggestion for Earth’s sake","url":"/story/2007-01-19/editorials/suggestion-earths-sake/","date":"January 19, 2007","content":"The Earth Centre, a new student-run campus retail store selling specifically eco-friendly products, opened Wednesday in the basement of Macgillivray-Brown Hall at the corner of Barrie and Earl streets.\nThe Earth Centre’s aim is to provide environmentally friendly alternatives to commonly used products, such as printer paper, light bulbs and household cleaners.,Seeing as how the service is stuck in the basement of a building unfamiliar to most students, the most important thing they have to do right now is make sure students know where they are. For any retail space, location is key—unfortunately, the basement of Macgillivray-Brown Hall isn’t going to attract any window shopping passersby. If it’s to be successful, the Earth Centre needs to publicize and advertise its existence. Selling students on the products, rather than the store, is one idea which may prove to be effective. Setting up floating stands with select products and information occasionally\naround campus, in high traffic areas such as the JDUC, could work to attract people to the products and then develop an interest, familiarity and loyalty to the store. Using other AMS services, such as the Tricolour Market, to advertise the store and showcase products (with countertop displays, for\nexample) would also get the word out. Allowing for online browsing and purchasing, with in-store pick-up, could also compensate for the Centre’s low-traffic location—so long as the website is effectively promoted.,The Earth Centre is a fantastic idea which encourages students to think about the impact their purchases have on the environment and hopefully students will support it.

At that point, I wanted to jump out of my seat, run out of the restaurant onto Princess Street screaming, “I got the job!” But instead, I kept my cool and said a simple “yes!” Nine months later, after being immersed into the world of leads, kickers, headlines,\ndots, flats, interviews and deadlines, I have to say that my excitement has waned just a little.,Come by the Journal House on a Monday or Thursday night and you’re likely to hear one—or many—of us cry out in frustration followed by a string of obscenities that would make a sailor blush. Stories are usually assigned on Tuesday, interviews and writing are done on Wednesday, editing and layout on Thursday, the paper comes out on Friday and then another story comes along for Tuesday’s issue nd the cycle begins all over again—and that’s only if everything goes according to plan. Too many times we find ourselves frantically running around and calling people on press day, only to be directed from one department to the other to or to have to leave a voicemail message that never gets returned or worse, to find out that the crucial person you need to interview has left the country for\nthe week.,There have been so many times that I’ve wanted to just run home and hide away so I could take a break from the non-stop cycle of putting out papers twice a week, but I just keep coming back. I’ve had a few friends tell me that I’ve sold my soul to the Journal and I joke about it too; but the truth is, f I didn’t love it, I wouldn’t be here. When I look around at the office, I see a group of students who eat, sleep and breathe the Journal, a staff that are so dedicated to their jobs they should probably be paying rent here.,Early mornings, late nights, skipped meals, neglected homework—not to mention neglected friends and housemates—are common amongst the bunch and rarely do I hear a complaint (okay, maybe the occasional rant). Not only have I met a bunch of talented and hardworking people but I’ve also learned so many things that I could never learn in a classroom—like perfecting the art of stalking,\nthe skill that every budding journalist needs. No longer do I feel shame when I have to resort to sending Facebook messages to strangers, or leaving post-its on office doors, or calling five, six or 10 times a day to try and find someone to interview. It’s February now and we’ve only got nine issues left. Editor in Chief elections are coming up and soon they’ll be hiring their new staff for next year.,As sentimental as I get when I realize that it’s almost over, I’m excited for the people that will come in and have the chance to experience the insanity as well as reap the rewards of working here. But now is not the time to get nostalgic. The year’s not over yet so it’s time to get back to work and keep on stalking.

After being rushed to the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario with unexplained symptoms including frequent urination, no appetite, extreme fatigue, unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain, I was diagnosed with Type 1\n(juvenile) diabetes. I spent three days in intensive care, where my dangerously high blood sugar levels\nwere gradually brought back to within the normal range, and the remaining week in the hospital where my family and I learned the complexities of dealing with my condition.,My carefree life of a 12-year-old was gone forever, only to be replaced by daily blood glucose testing and injections of insulin to stay alive. Because of the stigma that is sometimes attached to having\ndiabetes, I was reticent to tell people about my condition when I first came to Queen’s. I took off my medic alert bracelet and I didn’t tell anyone about my condition, not even my don, because I feared\nbeing judged or being thought of as disabled or different. Since being diagnosed, I have realized\nthat many people are not aware of the differences between Type 1 and Type 2, and group everyone with diabetes into the same category—often associated with the stereotype of being overweight and unhealthy, which are common misconceptions of people with juvenile diabetes. Although there are\nover two million Canadians who live with both types of diabetes, only 10 per cent have juvenile diabetes. People with juvenile diabetes are diagnosed between birth and their early 20s and cannot metabolize food properly because their bodies produce no insulin, unlike people with Type 2 diabetes, who are usually diagnosed past age 40 and their bodies can’t produce enough insulin or can’t use it effectively. Because of my inability to produce insulin, I require three daily injections. I also have to monitor my blood glucose levels carefully to ensure they don’t drop too low, which could result in coma or death, or high blood sugar levels, which could lead to future complications such as blindness, amputation, kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.,Although the causes are not entirely known, scientists believe Type 1 diabetes has to do with a presence of an HLA marker gene in the body. However, approximately 90 per cent of people who develop juvenile diabetes don’t have any family members who have it—like me.,Many people I have met over the years don’t seem to realize what diabetes is, and through this editorial, I hope to educate people and increase awareness of a condition that affects approximately 1 in 300 people, some of which include Halle Berry and Mary Tyler Moore.,At times, living with diabetes can be a challenge, but I refuse to let it take control of my whole life and define who I am. I have come to realize that only through accepting what I have, educating people and telling them about the condition I live with, will they become more aware.,For more information about juvenile diabetes, please visit jdrf.ca."},{"title":"The sour taste of apathy","url":"/story/2007-01-23/editorials/sour-taste-apathy/","date":"January 23, 2007","content":"Before you go to bed, sip a teaspoon of olive oil and suck on a lemon wedge.,The Italian grandmother—la nonna—offered me this caveat to cure inflammatory bowel disease.,What she lacks in medical knowledge, Nonna makes up for with fierce, obsessive love for her children and grandchildren. She’s fought the fight and only wants what’s best for us.,I’ll explain how this relates to the AMS elections.,Nonna puts a ridiculous amount of faith in her mother’s wisdom, particularly because she left her mother and Pordenone, a north-eastern Italian city featured in Hemmingway’s , on her wedding day with her new husband in 1951. They starved during the Second World War, and Nonno’s brother lost a toe to frostbite fighting for the Axis in Russia.,Like thousands of others during the 1950s, Nonno and Nonna immigrated to Canada after a tumultuous period in European politics—Mussolini is still a “great man,” if you ask them.,Growing up in Toronto, my father worked as soon as he could. He scrubbed chicken guts off a Keele Street butcher’s blades when he was 12, and drove a produce delivery truck before he had his driver’s licence. My mother’s parents are also Italian, but born in Canada. Their parents left Italy after the First World War, one of my great-grandfathers being forced out because he was a socialist and had to flee for his safety.,My mother’s parents were Depression kids and still won’t waste anything or spend unnecessarily. After a hot day at the driving range about seven years ago, Nonno scolded my brother and me for buying a Gatorade from a vending machine because we were only five minutes from free orange juice at home.,Nonno turns 80 this Sunday, and there will be 17 courses of food and three generations of family to celebrate.,In the last 80 years, Western history’s mass political movements have emptied on to the world. The fight for freedom of expression and civil liberties—and I’m talking about 50,000 people marching on Parliament, not 75 people walking down Princess Street—has quieted.,At Queen’s, student politics don’t matter much to people outside the  and the AMS. Students are complacent, the political atmosphere neutered. It’s no surprise we’ll probably have less than 30 per cent of students vote in February’s AMS executive election.,For the 70 per cent of students who don’t vote: way to show the world that all you need to do is sit back and enjoy the view—someone else has already done your fighting.,You would think with so many people in a position of privilege—one nonno of mine didn’t bother with school and the other couldn’t afford it—students would want to do better because they are in a position to do so.,Wrong.,To combat student indifference, the Journal will dedicate a portion of its election coverage to election issues from students’ perspectives. We will go beyond reporting about campaign platforms and focus instead on issues that you would like to see discussed.,It is our hope that you will, at the very least, vote on election day—even if it’s to spoil your ballot.,And if going to candidate debates gives you indigestion, I know something you could take to cure it."},{"title":"Isolation: life’s new soundtrack","url":"/story/2007-01-26/editorials/isolation-lifes-new-soundtrack/","date":"January 26, 2007","content":"Have you ever tried to grab someone’s attention while they were watching a TV show? How about in the middle of writing an e-mail, or worse yet, listening to an iPod?,Personal music players are one of many new technological devices leading us down the depressing road of isolation. Like living in your own movie with a personal soundtrack, MP3 players erect a barrier between the user and the rest of the world. More importantly, they have redefined how we think about community, public space and person-to-person contact.,Although sometimes escaping in a personal bubble of one’s favorite tunes can be comforting, we cannot allow our disconnection with the outside world to escalate to a disastrous level.,Music has become an intimate personal experience, but we must remain aware of our surroundings, for the sake of others as well as personal safety. Blocking out the sounds of the natural world can be pleasurable, but may cause problems if you fail to hear that bus screech by, or that stranger who has followed you to your car. If you do decide to don those infamous white earphones, you should keep a few things in mind.,Some find if disrespectful when an MP3 listener, whom they are conversing with, deems them only worthy enough to remove one earpiece. Or worse, none at all.,Be conscious of your iPod use. How often, when, and where you listen to your tunes can often become so instinctive that you may forget how it affects your interactions with other people.,More problematic, perhaps, is how it appears as if urban space has become so uncomfortable that people would choose to remain unbothered by their fellow citizens. Like a cellphone, personal music players have become a ubiquitous symbol that a person is otherwise engaged—perfect for those who want to head out in public ensuring others won’t talk to them, but not great for the health of the community at large.,Communities are built through random incidental contact, much of which is prevented when a person fails to remove their earphones when, say, paying for groceries. iPods are breeding a generation who will be as selective about their social lives as the songs they listen to, and although it’s nice to have a bubble to escape to now and then, with pervasive use it could severely affect the way communities grow and are shaped.,Although communication technology is allowing us more opportunities to stay connected, in another sense it’s making us less social. The prospect of avoiding unwanted random interactions may be appealing in certain situations, but we must understand the isolation that is created and the implications that this isolation may have on the future of our relationships and local communities.."},{"title":"Lost in translation","url":"/story/2007-01-26/editorials/lost-translation/","date":"January 26, 2007","content":"Me: So (awkwardly pausing and looking down at my feet) if you’re, like, not too busy, do you want to maybe have coffee?,Some guy: Yeah, that sounds good.,What I’m thinking: Great, it’s a date.,What he’s probably thinking: Great, I’ll need a coffee later … and I guess I could survive the company.,With Valentine’s Day--the commercially-contrived holiday despised by singletons across the globe—fast approaching, I thought it might be apt to consider why so much is lost in translation in our romantic endeavors.,I’ve always been fascinated by the verbal gymnastics we engage in as human beings. Rather than saying what we mean as clearly and concisely as possible, we have a flare for wrapping our thoughts in so many layers of convolution that our initial meaning is completely lost and those listening are left utterly confused. When it comes to dating, or prospective dating, we consciously choose to participate in a linguistic tango of sorts. Only what often ends up happening is that both dancers have two left feet.,With the dawn of instant messenger and Facebook, communication has never been more . If you’re talking to someone on MSN, it simply isn’t possible to capture the subtle nuances of speech—and no, the addition of an emoticon at the end of a typed sentence doesn’t help. If he adds a wink at the end of one of his sentences, does that reaffirm that he’s flirting? Or if she adds a face that’s blushing, does that mean that she’s receptive to your advances or simply appalled by what you have just said?,Facebook is even more odious. It has manifested into a free version of Lavalife where someone you barely know can add you as a “friend” as a way to open lines of communication. And if you don’t have any privacy settings in place, it’s essentially a free-for-all. The “advanced search” options allow an individual to narrow his or her criteria down to something as specific as musical taste. Creepy … maybe?,Women, generally speaking, have a tendency towards over-analysis. We talk about a simple exchange with a guy for hours and hours … and hours. And as much as I love coffee, the popularity of coffeehouses has perpetuated the plight of women everywhere; it has given birth to the dreaded coffee date. What does it mean? When is coffee just coffee? Or is it  just coffee? Would it be better to avoid the coffee date at all costs?,The decorum of dating is something that has puzzled me for as long as I can remember. How do you let someone know you like them without being totally and tragically awkward? And how can you tell if someone is actually interested in you? Unlike the days of Austen’s , someone’s affections can no longer be confirmed in a mere glance or a brush of the hand. You could end up non-dating dating someone for an eternity without ever talking about what is actually going on.,When it comes to the male-female dynamic specifically, I wish there was a book—some sort guide to traversing the foreign terrain of the male mind.,Maybe CAA should consider that their next publication."},{"title":"In defence of the arts","url":"/story/2007-01-30/editorials/defence-arts/","date":"January 30, 2007","content":"In true Facebook spirit, I joined the 66,035 members of the “I picked a major that I like, and one day I will probably be living in a box” group. It’s evident that, for a lot us arts majors, the fears of not finding a “well-paying” job are well and alive. Yet, I can’t bring myself to choose a career path that is merely pragmatic and won’t have any real meaning to me.,University is meant to be a period of self-exploration and gives us the very last opportunity of doing this before we venture off into the real world. We should take the opportunity to study as much literature, classics or history as we can since, after graduation, we will probably be too busy getting used to the confines of our stuffy workplace cubicles to contemplate the meaning of life in an intellectual setting ever again.,While I’m not against vocational majors, especially since these are fascinating fields of study and there are many who are naturally gifted in these areas, my point is that a student interested in art history, for instance, shouldn’t have to feel that they are on their way to a doomed future. It is, obviously, not all their fault, since there is admittedly not a huge pool of jobs that they can pick from. But a liberal arts major may be the best pick of all. More and more employers, including those much coveted investment banking firms, look for individuals who are as much at ease articulating their opinions on complex issues as they are analyzing the movements of stock prices. Liberal arts majors have a definite edge in this area.,But before we settle down into a cubicle for the rest 40 or so odd years of our working life, we owe it to ourselves to ask what we want to spend those four decades doing. While some may find their true calling in the financial world, there are probably many more who store away more idealistic dreams to get down to the drudgery of their everyday jobs. A familiar routine comes over again, as we wake up each morning to a job we don’t like, waiting impatiently for the weekend, wishing that we could change jobs, but never actually getting down to it. And, before we know it, it’s all over anyway and then, nothing matters any more.,While university is certainly a time to arm ourselves with the skills that will help us find employment later on, it need not turn into a vocational school that teaches me how to make lawn mowers so that I will be able to buy a house by the time I’m 26. While that does sound better than that much dreaded box, life is way too short for that kind of thing."},{"title":"Goodbye, Kingston","url":"/story/2007-02-06/editorials/goodbye-kingston/","date":"February 6, 2007","content":"This summer, on the night before the Wolfe Island Music Festival, I sat in the General Wolfe Hotel bar and watched a dozen hairy, sweaty, shirtless islanders dance their hearts out as the island’s most popular cover band played hard rock standards all night.,It was probably one of the most fun times I’ve had in Kingston.,As I approach the last couple of months before I’m supposed to graduate—and I prepare to leave not only Kingston, but also the country for a while, not knowing if or when I might be back—I’ve been thinking a lot about the time I’ve spent in this city and what it has meant to me.,I’m not really moved by the thought of leaving Queen’s, but when I consider that I may never live in Kingston again, I admit that it puts a bit of a lump in my throat.,Coming from North York, a neutered suburb of Toronto where sidewalks are largely unused and people still somewhat revere Mel Lastman, I immediately took to the strong sense of community that exists in Kingston, particularly among the small but fiercely supportive group of artists.,But it wasn’t until I spent a summer here that I really began to connect to the city in a more meaningful way.,Of course, Kingston isn’t without its flaws. There’s still an embarrassing obsession with the past, enough Not-In-My-Backyard-ism to make anyone under the age of 75 want to put their head through a wall, and a mayor who is clearly more comfortable discussing economic development than he is talking about people (anyone who was at this summer’s Pride parade can attest to this).,Like a former high school quarterback who hopelessly and pathetically longs for the glory days of his youth (remember Uncle Rico in Napoleon Dynamite?) while serving up Big Gulps at the local 7-11, Kingston spends an inordinate amount of time, energy and money celebrating how wonderful everything was in the 1840s (see First Capital Day, celebrated in Kingston every June 15 to mark the time from 1841 to 1844 when Kingston was the first capital city of a United Canada. First Capital Day events are scheduled for an entire two weeks and songs are sung by elementary school children that include the pitiful lyrics, “We’re not the capital anymore, but we were!”).,Sure, Kingston is home to some of the most important and influential moments in the founding of our country, and the city’s history is one of its most charming and interesting facets; but the obsession sometimes clouds the great things that are happening in the city today, such as the vibrant film culture, multiple community-based music festivals (Skeleton Park’s music festival is continuing this year and Wolfe Island’s is now probably one of the top three or four music fests in the country), leading wind-energy technology, strong environmental activism, community gardens and organic food movements.,I’m not interested in telling you to burst the Queen’s bubble or do your part to improve town-gown relations and become an engaged citizen, blah, blah, blah. You can make your university experience whatever you want.,All I know is that I’ve had a great time here largely because I’ve connected with people beyond the borders of campus, and when I leave, I’m going to miss a lot of those people. So, in this, the final signed editorial of my  career, I think I’d just like to say thanks to Kingston for having me."},{"title":"Services merger makes sense","url":"/story/2007-02-13/editorials/services-merger-makes-sense/","date":"February 13, 2007","content":"Almost two weeks ago, the AMS Board of Directors voted unanimously to merge the Greenroom and the Tricolour Market management, and also to move the Queen’s Entertainment Agency into the portfolio of one of Destinations’ assistant managers.,Although the Greenroom and the Tricolour Market will remain in separate locations and contain their current product line, the new management team—consisting of one head manager and three assistant\nmanagers (all 12-month positions)—will oversee both stores. The staff will also work at both stores, similar to how TAPS staff can work at both the Queen’s Pub and Alfie’s.,The intent of the merger is to cut overhead costs by eliminating some salaries and also to ease transition into the Queen’s Centre, where there will likely only be one store to fill the role of both the Greenroom and the Tricolour Market.,Finally, a plan for these two stores that actually makes some sense. Unlike last year’s decision to switch locations of the Greenroom and the Tricolour Market, the management and staff merger is an excellent idea as the AMS will be saving some costs on two money-losing services.,If all that the Tricolour market is doing is buying time—or rather, retail space—for the Queen’s Centre, wouldn’t it be even more cost-effective to keep the space, by continuing to pay rent, but close it down? If the store swap and management merger are only being put into place to ease transition into the Queen’s Centre, it seems it would be best to close one of the services for the next five to 10 years to avoid excess product and salary costs altogether.,It’s also nice to see the AMS make cuts to the long-suffering QEA, which continues to hemorrhage money without ever providing tangible benefits to students. What doesn’t seem to make any sense is that the media and volunteer director will continue to look after QEA, even though Destinations falls under the student services director’s portfolio.,It seems that some of the overlap in positions still needs to be worked out. Hopefully this merger will begin the gradual phasing out of QEA entirely. It’s one of the AMS’s more useless services and eliminating the salaries of the two managers is a long overdue and welcome adjustment."},{"title":"To each their own pod","url":"/story/2007-01-19/editorials/each-their-own-pod/","date":"January 19, 2007","content":"I guess I knew it would happen eventually, but I didn’t think it would be this soon. Over Christmas, I became one of the pod people. Since its launch in 2001, I have maintained a level of sub-par enthusiasm at the thought of owning an iPod. In the beginning, I suppose it was a financial decision, ut over the years I have developed a few personal qualms with Apple’s little music-maker. For starters, although iPod’s are terribly convenient, they can cause their users to be intolerably anti-social. Everywhere you look, people young and old are accompanied by one similar accessory: skinny\nlittle white headphones that have now become iconic of Apple’s iPod. One glaring accessory that is missing from these same music-loving people, however, is the presence of another person with them.,In a culture where innovations in technology are a daily occurrence, isn’t it ironic that levels of communication seem to be on a decline? Most of us would rather write an e-mailthan a letter. We’d rather chat on MSN than catch up in person. We stalk people on Facebook, yet might never make eye contact with those same people in a chance meeting. Now iPod users unanimously accept the opportunity to drown out the sounds of our everyday world. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Having the power to evade traffic noise, screaming children and basically any unpleasant clamour you wish to avoid? The downside to this, of course, is that along with that noisy guy on a cell phone, you might also be missing someone saying hello to you, or what’s worse, failing to hear that car that’s about to it you as you jaywalk on campus.,For many, iPods are more than just an MP3 player, they become an extension of one’s self. With this easily operated and aesthetically pleasing device, anyone can create a soundtrack to their life. The act of listening has been scientifically proven to have both physical and emotional effects, and by listening to music that can match or change one’s mood, iPods have allowed individuals to have control over heir personal environment. Nonetheless, “individual” is the word to keep in mind when considering pop culture, or rather, pod culture. In today’s society, the expression “two peas in a pod” seems to have been reformulated to reference a person and their iPod, as this device is thin enough to slip into\nany pocket and follow its user anywhere he or she goes. What ensues is the creation of an impermeable personal sphere, which is perhaps what consumers are, in the end, ultimately looking\nfor. It is, after all, called an iPod, and not awePod.,Whatever your reason, iPod ownership ensures that everyone knows you are on the cusp of the most revolutionary and relevant technology today; what’s more, you are a lover of music. I personally hope I’ll always prefer the comfort of hearing a friend say hello on the street to the convenience of music you can rock out to while you walk home.

As well, now that CMM has won the election, Julia Mitchell needs to focus on proving that she is deserving of students’ votes—beginning by using her passion for mental health initiatives to really make a difference.,Some of CMM’s most important decisions will also be their first, as they will begin hiring next year’s directors, commissioners and managers in the next few weeks. The people with whom an executive surround themselves are equally, if not more, important than the executives themselves. We challenge them to take these decisions seriously and look beyond their campaign supporters during the\nhiring process. TPC presidential candidate Alvin Tedjo’s post-election comments—that his team always felt like they were playing catch-up—aren’t surprising. Their campaign gimmicks couldn’t make up for their lack of organization and preparation. Still, it was heartening to know the student body’s vote\ncouldn’t simply be bought by cotton candy and video games.,Michael Ceci won the right to represent students on the Board of Trustees next year. There were other trustee candidates with stronger platforms, and who were generally more informed. But Ceci ran a widespread and sophisticated marketing campaign to make sure voters knew his face and name. His plan worked. Like trustee candidate Stephanie Kenny, we hope Ceci has listened to his opponents during the campaign, and will listen to them and others when representing students on the influential board. But Ceci’s first statements upon hearing of his election are troublesome.,He said he will work towards getting the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario to use the power granted to him by Queen’s royal charter—a power that was granted archaically, acts as little more than a symbol now, and has\nnever once been employed—to appoint the four candidates who ran against him to the board. We hope that was mostly the alcohol talking.,Ceci did a great job catching students’ eyes, and we can only hope he will dedicate as much time and energy to his term representing students as he did during his campaign period."},{"title":"VIP counsellor care","url":"/story/2007-01-30/editorials/vip-counsellor-care/","date":"January 30, 2007","content":"In the 2004-2005 academic year, the Commerce Society Assembly voted to put commerce students’ annual $50, opt-outable fee towards a $10,000 endowment for exclusive counselling services from the Health Counselling and Disability Services (HCDS). The next year, the School of Business took over the funding for the exclusive counsellor at Goodes Hall, and now it’s available twice per week—\none day for undergraduates and a second day for graduate students. Students and professors alike can book appointments on their own website and skip a three-week wait at HCDS. The situation essentially amounts to a small-scale, two-tier health care system on campus.,Amanda Chan, ComSoc vp (external) said, “Our lifestyle is [such] that Goodes is almost a one-stop point for us,” and added that the counsellor was hired primarily for convenience. Surely students from all faculties would benefit from the convenience of shorter wait times for counselling services. There’s nothing in particular about business students’ lives that would put them in greater need of a counsellor than other students. This underscores the disparity between faculties at Queen’s, especially the endowment of the School of Business in relation to others 0on campus. Putting a price on students’\nhealth is morally wrong—especially when the price changes across disciplines. Although HCDS should exist to serve all students, regardless of the faculty they belong to, they cannot be to blame for providing extra care for a particular demographic that has expressed a need and paid the price.,Neither can the School of Business be blamed for looking out for the best interests of its students. But the University bears an equal responsibility for all students, and they should not have allowed this to appen. The need to set up a separate system indicates there is a problem with health services at Queen’s. Although the School of Business’ exclusive counsellor is an additional counsellor and is not taking away from the services regularly supplied by HCDS, it remains unfair for business students to have greater access to health services. Students in each discipline experience stressful life circumstances and should have an equal right to all of their health-care needs—physical or mental.\nWhoever approved the separate system failed to notice that something was inherently wrong with letting a specific group cut ahead of the rest of the line."},{"title":"Men & the Monologues","url":"/story/2007-02-13/editorials/men-and-monologues/","date":"February 13, 2007","content":"Despite outstanding performances by the cast of the Vagina Monologues Sunday and Monday night, it’s hard to get past John Taggart’s role as co-director.,This is the first time in the University’s nine years of performing the Vagina Monologues that there has been a male director.,Although it’s important for men to be included in the discussion of feminism and women’s rights, the movement hasn’t evolved to the point where men should be leading.,The Vagina Monologues is a play that raises awareness about violence against women while also celebrating feminism and women’s rights in all of its forms; therefore, it’s undeniable that men should be supporting and volunteering wherever they can—but leading the movement is another story. Although feminism is an extremely broad category, one that cannot be defined solely by a person’s anatomical makeup, the Vagina Monologues is more than just a forum on feminism; it’s an arena for women to discuss femininity among themselves without feeling judged or alienated.,If the presence of a male co-director causes the women to feel uncomfortable, or pressures them to censor their discussion, then Taggart’s role is a problem. It would be a shame if the value of having what has traditionally been a women’s-only space was compromised by Taggart’s participation.,It’s clear that Taggart’s direction isn’t the issue, and it’s obviously not about him as a person. He seems to understand where women are coming from and with co-director Ainsley Brittain by his side, ome of our concerns are diminished. That said, the concept of a man telling a woman how to express her femininity seems absurd. Before the show, Brittain said, “I like the idea of having men involved, but] it’s counterintuitive to have a man direct women to tell women’s stories.” We couldn’t agree more. Being a woman and dealing with issues specific to women simply cannot be learned, even with the best intentions.,The Vagina Monologues cannot—and should not—be a completely feminine experience, but the greatest role men can play is supporting the women performing in it by attending the show and heeding its important messages."},{"title":"A new child care service","url":"/story/2007-01-26/editorials/new-child-care-service/","date":"January 26, 2007","content":"If you find yourself scrambling for enough time to attend classes, participate in extracurriculars, try doing it with a baby.,The AMS after-hours child care service was cancelled in July 2005 due to a lack of demand. At that time, a study of the service showed that no more then 17-20 families used the service. With no care available after 5 p.m., undergraduate and graduate students, as well as some members of Queen’s faculty, may be having difficulty finding appropriate child care.,The Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS) is currently conducting an online survey to gain a better understanding of the number of people in the Queen’s community who would benefit from reinstating affordable, after-hours child care. Although the previous service was funded mostly by the AMS, Only 33 per cent of its users were undergraduate students.,The child care service may not be profitable, but the AMS has a long history of funding money-losing businesses—The AMS Pub Services budgeted a deficit of $64,000 this year. By this logic, maintaining an essential service such as child care, regardless of the number of students using it, should be a no-brainer.,That said, undergraduate students’ money shouldn’t be the only source of funding for a service also used by graduate students and faculty. If this service is to be re-established, the university should be responsible for the overhead costs, with the balance split proportionally between the SGPS and the AMS, depending on the ratio of the number of their members that use the service.,Child care shouldn’t be treated as a money making opportunity. The University has a responsibility to take care of student parents as it would any other minority group needing extra assistance. But if the AMS is to get back on board, external funding needs to be guaranteed: the University needs to step up and take some responsibility.,It’s important to offer these services to ensure that education is accessible to everyone. As well, providing child care may encourage those who have left school to raise children to return. Child care services are a valuable resource to members of the community and their necessity cannot be underestimated or ignored by the University and the societies who represent the students who use them. Raising a child can be a very expensive and challenging experience, especially for students, and it's essential that services are provided to make this process easier for parents wishing to further their education."},{"title":"Six steps to victory","url":"/story/2007-01-23/editorials/six-steps-victory/","date":"January 23, 2007","content":"Campaigning for the AMS executive election begins this week and the Journal has put together a campaign wish list for this year’s candidates.,1. Take the job seriously. Candidates sign up for various reasons: to pad a resume, make a difference or even to gain power. Whatever the reason, it’s important that you go in with an accurate conception of what the job entails.,2. Recognize the limitations of the position. It’s important that a team recognize its limitations (such as time and resources) as well as the limitations of each position. Going into the campaign with unrealistic\ngoals and proposing major overhauls will do more harm than good. It’s a better idea to keep things on a steady path, or initiate change that will take place over a longer time period (meaning years, not weeks).,3. Don’t make promises you can’t keep. Teams can’t be re-elected, and therefore face no true means of accountability. Although it may be tempting to promise the world, be honest and realistic.,4. Let your character shine through. Hotbutton issues that dominated campaigns in the past, such as tuition, Homecoming and the Queen’s Centre, have more or less died down, making this campaign less about the platforms, and more about the people. It’s important to emphasize what kind of person\nyou are and the values you find important.,Nobody is perfect, but it’s important to be honest about uncertainties or mistakes. Students want representatives with integrity and good judgment.,5. Be classy and clean. Running a clear and meaningful campaign will mean a lot more than repeating a slogan. If you do have a motto, don’t let it be your entire platform.,6. Don’t overestimate your importance. Realistically, student politics aren’t important to the majority of students, and last year’s voter turnout of 32.3 per cent is still one of the highest in the country. Voter turnout will likely be around the same rate this year so please don’t be a nuisance to those who\nare uninterested and push more voters away from the polls."},{"title":"Fall Reading Week won’t work","url":"/story/2007-02-02/editorials/fall-reading-week-wont-work/","date":"February 2, 2007","content":"Whether it involves heading south for some well deserved relaxation or taking the time to catch up on work (and sleep), one thing remains the same—everyone loves a break. So it would be safe to assume that adding another Reading Week to the year would be every students dream. Right?,Last week, AMS Assembly approved a question to asking students if they would like to have a fall Reading Week, added to the University calendar. The question is set to appear on the referendum ballots next Tuesday and Wednesday. Although referendum questions of policy are non-binding—so even if a majority of students were in favour, the administration would not be obligated to implement it—if enough interest is generated, the results of the vote will be brought to the administration likely with the AMS’s support.,The question was put forward by Sivan Nitzan, ArtSci ’09, who was told by various members of the AMS, as well as Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane and Associate-Dean of Arts and Science Cynthia Fekken, that another Reading Week is possible, but student opinion must be considered before any changes are to take place.,What students need to understand before casting their votes, however, are the various implications attached to a second Reading Week.,One such implication is that the missed week of classes must be made up, which would likely cause school to start a week earlier in September, and thus, cutting into those last few precious days of summer holidays. Many students use the extra week in September to say goodbye to friends and family and get their things together for the new school year. As well, those who work during the summer may have a difficult time leaving their employment as many summer jobs typically run until Labour Day. Or, students may simply not want to miss a week’s worth of pay.,As a primarily residential school, Queen’s just isn’t fit to begin their fall term any earlier.,November is a rough month for students as they become stressed, sick, and even depressed. But adding another Reading Week wouldn’t address those problems, and may even create more. Issues of stress are a big deal on campus and it’s shortsighted to assume that taking a week off will alleviate the problems.,Time would be better spend addressing issues of the University system at a deeper level—a level that doesn’t treat escaping problems as the solution for better student health and wellness."},{"title":"Team CMM the best to take the AMS reins","url":"/story/2007-02-06/editorials/team-cmm-best-take-ams-reins/","date":"February 6, 2007","content":"Team CMM’s impressive preparation, diligence and leadership potential have won us over as our preferred choice for next year’s AMS executive.,Although Team TPC—Presidential candidate Alvin Tedjo, Vice-President (University Affairs) candidate Liz Craig and Vice-President (Operations) candidate John Paterson—touched on a lot of the same points as CMM—Presidential candidate Kingsley Chak, Vice-President (University Affairs) candidate Julia Mitchell and Vice-President (Operations) candidate John Manning—Team CMM hit the ground\nrunning and have never looked back.,Their most thought-out platform idea is to create a university-wide sustainability office, but the remainder of their platform—while showing that they’re trying to take the interest of students at heart—are somewhat recycled campaign platforms of yore. The team’s strengths lie not in promises for a video guide, another revamped website and a peer counselling service, but in their character as human beings. Although we’re concerned by Chak’s abstention from voting on a tuition increase\nat the Board of Trustees, he remains one of the most informed and dedicated student politicians at Queen’s. As student trustee the past two years,Chak hasn’t yet had to work co-operatively and closely with teammates. Hopefully he’ll learn that good leaders motivate, inspire and work with those around him—they don’t merely tell you what to do. Chak’s involvement on the Board of Trustees, while providing him with a wealth of experience and insight into the functioning of the University, also presents him with a challenge: to appreciate his new position and overcome the coziness with Queen’s bureaucracy, which he has become accustomed to. Manning knows his stuff and his sharp debating last Wednesday proved that. Both during this campaign and through his previous work with the AMS, Manning has proven himself to be a strong and capable leader who takes the time and effort to learn.\nWhat’s more, when he doesn’t have an answer for you, he’ll say so.,Mitchell’s lack of AMS knowledge has left us with several questions and concerns, but we remain optimistic that she will work hard to catch up. She seems genuine in her concern for student wellness and determined to make tangible improvements in this area. Chak and Mitchell also need to work\nbetter as a team, so they don’t look like an embittered married couple: Chak needs to back off and Mitchell should step up.,Team CMM’s peer-counselling service may prove challenging to implement and operate. It also may not be that popular. We don’t expect students will be any more willing to discuss their personal problems with their peers than professionals, and the HCDS director said it won’t do much to reduce wait times.,As for TPC, their plan to install surveillance cameras at various locations on campus hasn’t been subject to sufficient research. Admittedly, the recent spate of campus thefts is a major problem, but TPC hasn’t consulted with students to find out if installing surveillance cameras is a desired response.\nTPC also hasn’t taken the hint from Swipe and other failed convenience card programs with their new and improved Q.Cash platform idea. Neither have they fully explained why we need such a program,\nother than to reduce wait times. And sustainability is about more than simply adding recycling bins.\nSimilarly, reducing the number of exams in order to declare a conflict, while an idea worthy of discussion, fails to address issues of mental health and stress in a meaningful way.,Tedjo has worked in a variety of different roles within the AMS, but none of his resultant experience has proven himself worthy of AMS president. Paterson has worked tirelessly for both the AMS Information Technology Office and Queen’s First Aid; while he may be one of the hardest working people in this campaign, we don’t see him as an effective vice-president. Although we are endorsing CMM, we also wish we could somehow vote for Liz Craig. Along with Manning, she stood out as\nthe only other strong candidate on the ballot, and she should be commended for the passion and commitment displayed throughout the campaign. She’s knowledgeable about university and AMS issues, and has already proven her leadership abilities through her extensive work within COMPSA.,Whether you agree or disagree, we hope that you will use our endorsement as a tool in deciding for whom to vote today and tomorrow."},{"title":"Hanging Saddam","url":"/story/2007-01-12/editorials/hanging-saddam/","date":"January 12, 2007","content":"We interrupt your regular scheduled programming to bring you gratuitous and sensationalized footage of Saddam Hussein’s execution.,As it’s now well known, Saddam was executed by hanging on Dec. 30 after being convicted of crimes against humanity for the killing of 148 Shiites. Although few would dispute Saddam’s guilt, the trial itself was hardly a beacon of justice. Among the trial’s travesties were the open verbal sparring between the judge and Saddam and the assassinations and attempted assassinations of both the prosecuting and defending lawyers. Midway through the trial, the chief judge was replaced.,Despite the overwhelming amount of evidence against him, Saddam should still have been entitled to a fair and legitimate trial with an impartial judge. There’s value in having the Iraqi people themselves put their former dictator on trial, but Saddam should have been tried in an international court, as Slobodan Milosevic was, to ensure the complete and satisfactory application of justice.,It was disappointing that the decision to go through with Saddam’s execution happened so quickly, before he was able to stand trial for all of the crimes he had been accused of. This denied victims and their families a means of restitution. Even if the death penalty was warranted early on in the trial, it should have been stayed until the trial was completed fully.,If the reason for rushing Saddam’s trial and execution was to encourage greater stability and progress in Iraq, the attempt backfired as Saddam’s execution has caused only greater unrest. His hanging was turned into a circus and used as a tool for the U.S. government to try to show that Iraq is making progress, rather than a matter of international justice.,Even for a mass murderer, the choice to execute Saddam only hours before the recognized Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha shows a complete disregard for human dignity.,The media didn’t help matters. CNN and other news stations sensationalized the event, airing—and continuously re-airing— the tape of Saddam seconds before he was killed. When something this sensitive is broadcast so liberally, it’s a sad testament to American media.,But the way the trial was treated is more problematic than the videos that have proliferated after his execution. Whether he was a brutal murderer or not, the way his trial and execution were handled\nonly reflects poorly on the Iraqi and American authorities."},{"title":"Split ends for income tax","url":"/story/2006-11-24/editorials/split-ends-income-tax/","date":"November 24, 2006","content":"The Conservative government is in the process of preparing their 2007 Budget, and one of the proposed changes is a complete overhaul of the Canadian taxation system. The proposed change involves income splitting—where income differences between married partners are evenly distributed, or more simply, the income of partners is averaged for tax purposes.,Finance Minister Jim Flaherty’s proposal is merely searching for another loophole aimed at giving tax breaks to those who don’t need them. Obviously the government isn’t looking out for the country as a whole; income splitting means they would receive fewer dollars from tax revenue to fund important social programs.,Single income families will be saving the most money as the averaging out of a couple’s income creates an even playing field for every family. This will only hinder those middle and low-income families who currently require both parents to work full-time, not to mention single-parent families who receive no break at all.,The plan also doesn’t address how divorced, separated and other non-traditional couples will be affected under the system.,While this is another poorly thought out plan for the country, it’s also a detrimental idea with regards to the Conservatives’ political capital. Harper’s Conservatives still only have a minority government, and this could be a polarizing piece of legislation.,The government shouldn’t be providing incentives for couples to be married or incentives for a parent to stay out of the workforce, regardless of the undeniable importance of child-rearing. This short-sighted plan will only pull back the progressivity of the tax system and increase inequalities as most of the middle and low-income households will still bear the same financial burden. Hopefully this impulsive shift won’t become part of the budget as there is no reasonable fiscal, social or even political good that could come from it."},{"title":"Canada’s new ‘united’ nation","url":"/story/2006-11-30/editorials/canadas-new-united-nation/","date":"November 30, 2006","content":"Earlier this week, Canada’s House of Commons voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion to\nrecognize the Québécois as “a nation within a united Canada.”,The resolution was put forth by Prime Minister Stephen Harper after adding the words “within a united Canada” to a similar motion presented by Gilles Duceppe and the Bloc.,But the first instance of the nation debate occurred a few weeks ago when Liberal leadership candidate Michael Ignatieff used the term to describe Québec, sparking a fierce debate within the Liberal party and among all leadership candidates.,Canada is already an officially bilingual country, with a separate and unique culture, language and history of Québec fully noted. Why then, was there a need to further the recognition?,Rex Murphy perhaps said it best in his column in last Saturday’s Globe and Mail: “This is a national unity debate that is entirely ‘constructed.’ It did not spring from any crisis of events … Politics, and only politics—in the narrowest and most negative sense of that word—has brought this debate on.”\nThe vagueness of the resolution also creates new problems because it doesn’t specify who exactly it applies to (are all Quebeckers Québécois?) and isn’t clear on the definition of “nation”.,The entire debate seems more like a political ploy to bolster Conservative support in Québec and stir up dissent within the Liberal party during their leadership campaign than any legitimate move towards equality. With new recognition as a separate nation, Québec separatists may use the resolution as a weapon in future sovereignty debates.

With a considerable number of large-scale projects in progress, a level of consistency and leadership from Rosen will be beneficial to the city.,As for the Large Venue Entertainment Centre, it’s time that city council agrees—to disagree. Ground has already been broken and continuous discussions will only prove useless and tiresome. Rosen will continue on as the mayor, but fortunately, with only four council members returning, he will be forced to be more accountable and open with his future business decisions. We can only hope that Rosen will take the message voters gave him to heart and adjust his practices to better serve the Kingston community.,Also surprising, however, was the child-like display by the three student candidates. They sounded like five-year-olds whining for a cookie their older siblings ate. Nathanial Erskine-Smith, whom the Journal endorsed last issue commented having another student run in the Sydenham district took away from his own campaign. The truth is, all candidates have to work to differentiate themselves; Erskine-Smith shouldn’t blame a fellow student for his loss. Alex Huntley, the other Sydenham student hopeful, was no better: his poor attempt to save face with his statement, “To be honest, I never expected to win” only showed his inexperience and immaturity. Most of Williamsville candidate Andrew Goodridge’s quotes weren’t even fit for print.,The Sydenham votes went to Bill Glover who has a substantial task ahead of him—mending relations with students. As Chair of the Sydenham Ward Tenants and Ratepayers Association, Glover was vocal about his displeasure with students. Now he has to represent students, the overwhelming majority in Sydenham ward. Hopefully, Glover won’t increase antagonisms when town-gown relations (especially at times like Homecoming) are starting to improve.,It will also be interesting to see how Glover handles student issues with the overwhelming student apathy at Queen’s. Because Kingston may only be a student’s home for a short period, many have no long-term investment in their house, street or ward.,But if students expect to be treated the same as permanent residents by Glover, they need to see themselves as Kingstonian’s first."},{"title":"Hard to take rankings seriously","url":"/story/2006-11-03/editorials/hard-take-rankings-seriously/","date":"November 3, 2006","content":"Last week, The Globe and Mail released its 2006 University Report Card magazine, with rankings based on student satisfaction. Maclean’s magazines university issue comes out today.,Although the articles are informative, realistically, most people buy these magazines for the rankings. Unfortunately, the surveys are only based on student opinion and cannot be looked at as objective. Most of the students have only attended one school, so their experiences are limited. Although opinions are useful when used qualitatively, once a number (or in this case a letter grade) is attached, it’s hard not to be skeptical.,Although rankings are irrelevant if a student already has a top choice school, they can provide a different perspective for those who would otherwise only see the administration-approved pamphlets and the overly exuberant tour guides. But whether a school is “right” for an individual cannot be found in any magazine, or ranking system done. No single tool should be the sole-determinant of choosing one’s university or post-graduate program, but these rankings can’t do any harm, as long as they are approached properly.,In the end, it’s hard to take these media publications too seriously as they are motivated by profit—The Globe and Mail and Maclean’s publish the rankings because they sell. Although interesting to read, it’s impossible to gauge how well a student will fit into a particular university community based only on opinion-based rankings.

Where my time should go and where it ends up going sometimes don’t line-up, but I’m learning to straighten that out, for me.,Everyone is wishing for more time. But I sometimes think that if we ever got our wish, we’d just pack in the busy and ask again for more. The light bulb gave us more time and all we did was fill it with more work and less sleep; 24-hour Stauffer will do the same.,When I lived with my parents in the country, I got up with the sun and I got everything done. Now in university, I lose sleep over due dates and deadlines. We try to do too much because we think we have to do it all. It’s often too much for our time to handle. My time has been spread in so many different directions, I’ve been forced to pull it together and decide: Am I using my time to fulfill my own expectations for myself or for those of others?,As exams creep up, we cram our time full of books and marks and coffee; it’s threw this experience that I have learnt a bit about geography but, thankfully, more about how important it is to take a step back and a deep breath to think about everything else that matters more in my life than a percentage. I used to be the one losing her tears over one mark on one test in one class in one year—it’s just not worth it.,My family and my friends are what I think about the most, and they are highest on my list of where my time should be spent: My job at this newspaper has been my diamond in the rough of higher education. It has earned—and received—more of my time than lecture slots. My health is up there, too; Way far down the list are my marks. I care about education; I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.

Generally, it stays on the street, but sometimes, it’ll be inside a campus building. Last weekend, a fight broke out in front of the Walkhome kiosk.,I’m not trying to say that there’s been a recent rise in fighting on or off campus, but for some reason, I’ve been noticing it more.,Though I’m pretty quick to condemn fighting in general, I’ll be the first to admit that on some level I want to see it happen. I enjoy watching the occasional UFC bout or hockey fight, but there’s something different about a street fight. There’s a definite shock value, but also something … humanizing about it.,Some people will definitely be unhappy with my characterization of fighting as ‘humanizing.’ In any case, what I mean by ‘humanizing’ is that there’s a genuine expression of emotion that’s rarely seen—in public at least. Humans are emotional beings, but our culture urges us to repress certain feelings, especially when those feelings are present in men.,I’ve spent some time trying to understand why people actually engage in fights. I guess the book Fight Club would be a good place to start. The author, Chuck Palahniuk, described the modern man as dissatisfied with the current ideals of masculinity, and trying to forge a new masculine identity.,Maybe it’s irresponsibility, but perhaps the current state of masculinity at Queen’s is an underlying reason for fighting. On some level, I think it is, but only reflection from those who participate in fights will reveal that.,At Queen’s however, and any university for that matter, a more likely cause of violence is work-related stress. Queen’s students are under an incredible amount of pressure. From our extra-curricular involvements, internship and full-time job hunting, varsity athletics and ever-increasing educational requirements, we have less and less time to take a break and relax.,With Stauffer now open for 24 hours during the exam period, more students will probably live life at the extremes: pulling all-nighters to study for their exam, and upon completion, heading straight to the bar to celebrate or drown their sorrows. Those same students will be back at Stauffer Library the next morning, hung over, and repeating the cycle. I can’t remember where I read this, but this kind of life was described as: “Having one foot on a stove element, and one foot on a block of ice. The average temperature might be lukewarm, but in the end, you’ll just end up with two blistered feet.” This lifestyle isn’t healthy—our stress level doesn’t decrease, we just burn out.,If I’m right, maybe we just need an outlet to vent our endless list of grievances. A better solution would be for Queen’s to revisit the style and structure of education here as a whole. Our problems as students are, in some ways, symptomatic of a potential flaw in the system. There’s a temporary solution: Queen’s could provide us with some broken office equipment, baseball bats and a single-track CD with Damn it feels good to be a gangsta."},{"title":"A toast to tofu","url":"/story/2007-01-12/editorials/toast-tofu/","date":"January 12, 2007","content":"In high school, I became vegetarian for the wrong reasons--to be different, to bug my parents, and to carve out an identity for myself.,Admittedly, these were all selfish reasons for taking on something that requires ample knowledge of nutrition, not to mention strong opinions about the consumption of animals. But, thanks mostly to my mother's cooking, I managed to remain vegetarian until my second year at Queen's. More specifically, until homecoming weekend when I scarfed down a chicken burger at Stooley's. Thus ended my misguided venture into vegetarianism.,But one thing that has stayed with me since I started eating meat again is my love for that misunderstood soy byproduct, tofu. I don't understand why so many people have a hate-on for this remarkable food item. Not only is it versatile, it's a healthy alternative to meat. Tofu is high in protein, low in calories and has no cholesterol. It's made by coagulating soy milk, a practice from China that dates back to the second century BC.,I use tofu in most of my cooking, and I always have some in my fridge which I can eat raw as a snack.,But I, too, was once bewildered by tofu. The odourless and tasteless qualities, its squishy texture, and the fact that most people have no idea where it comes from or how its made make it unsettling, to say the least. I've even heard some call tofu “disgusting,” which I can understand. It's only when you forget your apprehension, throw caution to the wind, and take that first bite of tofu that you can truly learn to appreciate its many values.,It's soft tofu that really has the worst reputation. Compared to firm tofu, the soft variety has a really squishy texture and is more difficult to cook with. This is the stuff that bewildered me the most when I first started to incorporate tofu into my diet. Like a lot of food that's known to be good for your health, I didn't want to eat it. But I figured it would be better than eating meat, or “dead animal” as I referred to it. Nowadays I seriously don't know what I'd do without it. Most of the food I prepare, in fact, has tofu in it--pasta dishes, stir-fries, sandwiches, etc.,Had it not been for my attempt at the vegetarian lifestyle, I probably wouldn't be so inclined to eat tofu as often as I do today. It's too bad that tofu is associated almost exclusively with the vegetarian diet, though it is becoming more popular. Tofu is available at nearly every supermarket, usually conspicuously close to the veggie burgers and other non-meat items.

Now, I don’t profess to being a computer nerd, or anything close to it, but it didn’t take me long to download and see for myself what everyone was talking about.,In a few seconds, I had gone from looking at the Earth as a blue marble in space to zooming right down through the atmosphere into incredibly detailed images of entire cities with individual houses, buildings, roads, and cars easily discernible. Needless to say, I spent much of the night zooming in and out, arriving at the Eiffel Tower one second and the Statue of Liberty the next.,While a program like this is delightful for those who like visiting different places, albeit virtually, or even just to aerially fly over your own neighbourhood, it’s not without its issues.,Privacy is one that naturally comes to mind. A headline in a newspaper article recently read: “Google Earth zooms in on sunbather.” It came with a link to a Youtube video which, sure enough, did show someone zooming right down to Holland, complete with sound effects, and eventually focusing on a hapless sunbather reclining on a beach chair in the Hague, entirely unaware that a satellite was tracking his actions a few thousand miles above and making it available to all and sundry, or at least, those with a computer and broadband internet connection (and enough time on their hands). The video garnered well over 2 million views and counting, leading the sunbather to probably ask himself: “Whatever happened to good, old-fashioned privacy?” I wouldn’t disagree with him. While the images we see on Google Earth are anywhere from several months to two years old, further tweaking may conceivably result in spying on other people’s actions in the not-so-distant future. More alarming, though, is the risk this potentially poses to a country’s national security—terrorists being one group who could use this information to their advantage.,There’s a saddening aspect to this too. Not even ten years ago, when Youtube and Google Earth and Wikipedia didn’t exist, I, and I’m sure others, will remember having an actual globe instead of a virtual one, looking at countries and places that were exciting because of their distance and subsequent “exotic” appeal. There was a certain comfort in knowing that there were some things that were out of reach. It seems to me that when an elementary school student can get information on anything they want within a few milliseconds by using the Internet, having instantaneous access to knowledge comes at the price of a sense of wonder. That sense of wonder piques human curiosity and leads to exploration and discovery. I can’t help but think that today’s younger generation will grow up skipping those vital steps and settle into a desensitized mindset that may well go against progress in the future."},{"title":"Short winter; long underwear","url":"/story/2007-01-16/editorials/short-winter-long-underwear/","date":"January 16, 2007","content":"As the daughter of a man who, for reasons unbeknownst to me, keeps his television tuned to the Weather Channel for the greater part of his day, I have been raised with an almost obsessive tendency to track the daily highs and lows of my climactic environment. Combined with a severe inability to tolerate temperatures that dip below freezing and a personality that borders on dangerously\nneurotic, my constant weather tracking led me to create a precise plan of action for dealing with Kingston’s often frigid airs. Every year, on Oct. 1, my chic fall clothing gives way to a hooded parka, insulated mittens, thermal knee-high socks and my trusted, full-body coat of armor: Helly Hanson long underwear.,In years past, there has been, of course, the odd moment when my winter attire was met with ridicule from students revelling in an unseasonably decent day. They, barbequing in Bermuda shorts and flip flops, would gawk as I shuffled to class with nary a visible body part underneath my toasty layers. For the most part, however, my rigid weather protection plan offered much-needed security in our\ndangerous Canadian landscape of blustery winds and surprise snowstorms, and I often had the last laugh as I watched the poor saps who hadn’t had the foresight to put on their treaded winter boots before trekking to class that morning.,And so, it was no different this year. On Oct. 1, I pulled my Helly Hanson’s from the closet and readied myself for six months with a second skin of synthetic safety. At first, the weather progressed as I had expected. Cold winds, frequent rain and dreary days were hints of the brutal winter to come. But it\nnever did.,Day in and day out, I awoke to sunshine and chirping birds outside my window, wondering whether or not to continue with my cold weather routine. Should I accept the bizarre and disconcerting warmth, shun my Helly Hanson’s and the trusted protection they had so willingly provided for three long years?\nIt only takes one look at the waistband of my pants to answer that question. Stretched over my belly button, my off-white long underwear remains, and will remain, until the Weather Channel announces the first day of spring. Call me crazy, but it just wouldn’t be winter in Kingston without the mild discomfort and awkward chafing that I’ve come to know and love. You could even say that this is my own unique form of environmental activism. If I wear them, winter will come.,So if you see me on campus, my winter boots tramping through dirt and beads of sweat pouring out from underneath my parka’s hood, stop and think for a minute: Sure, mini-skirts and Ugg boots are great, but if you feel something missing (and I know you do), go home and scrounge around for that long underwear you thought you could do without this year. Put it on, and join me in proclaiming solidarity with winter."},{"title":"The waiting game","url":"/story/2006-11-24/editorials/waiting-game/","date":"November 24, 2006","content":"On Monday night, my housemate found out she would be spending the summer in Africa. She received a phone call from QPID, choosing her as a co-operant for their Burkina Faso project.,The past couple of months have been fairly chaotic in our household because November tends to be a particularly disconcerting time to be a fourth-year student. It’s usually when talk of the future—or at least what you’ll be doing after graduation—reaches a fever pitch. I should know; I’m living it, and so are four of my housemates. And what we’re all asking ourselves is, “When did having too many options become a bad thing?” We each have different aspirations: one wants to go to med school, one wants to work in business, one wants to teach, one wants to be a journalist and how one is going to Africa. We’re all drowning in our own grad school applications and job applications, while also applying for every summer internship we can get our hands on. We have nightly conversations about what we see ourselves doing a year from now, and what we want our post-student life to be like.,We’re all in a state of continuous uncertainty, waiting for the big envelope in the mail, or the phone call offering us the interview. It feels like we’re in grade 12 again, except we’re older, wiser and getting ready to begin “real life.” For the next few months, we’ll be contending with assignments, exams and the reality of facing an uncertain future.,In April, we’ll have degrees. Real ones. As a university graduate, numerous opportunities await us … as long as we can convince our future employer or graduate school that we are more capable than the multitudes of other graduates all vying for the same job or spot that we are.,Getting the mail becomes a daily event for those waiting to hear from schools, and checking your voicemail for job news becomes as frequent as checking your e-mail. And after you’ve secured your job or graduate school of choice, you arrive at the next obstacle: distance.,Distance takes on a whole new meaning when faced with the realization that this time next year, you or some of your best friends will be halfway around the world. After four years of integrating yourself into somewhere new and unfamiliar, you’re thrown into a whole new community where you have to re-establish yourself in yet another unfamiliar setting. Despite my readiness to move on, the idea of distance between the people I have grown and changed with isn’t very appealing.,My housemate going to Burkina Faso in May can only see as far as September in concrete terms. She has no idea what lies beyond the fall of next year, and she feels okay not having a plan. I admire her ability to appreciate the present rather than fixate on the future. Some fourth-years have enough faith in their abilities and in the future to be satisfied with just living out the moment, and savoring the last few months of an experience we won’t ever be able to relive.,Those of us who don’t, like me, will just continue to neurotically monitor our various mailboxes until our answers arrive."},{"title":"The value of education","url":"/story/2006-11-30/editorials/value-education/","date":"November 30, 2006","content":"Once in a while, a white envelope emblazoned with the maroon coat-of-arms of Queen’s University adorns my mailbox amongst the various flyers and bills. Regardless of the subject of the letter inside, I am always struck by the unassuming text at the bottom of the letterhead, reminding me that I am part of an institution that is “Preparing leaders and citizens for a global society.”,When I first saw those words on my offer of admission, I was confident in their validity. Half a decade—and almost $40,000—later, I’m not so sure.,In recent history, postsecondary education in the western world has focused on the training of hyper-competitive graduates to meet the grade-point average benchmarks of postgraduate study and industry, which I believe is to the detriment of the preparation of well-rounded, altruistic and critical thinkers of tomorrow. Two weeks ago, my colleague and friend Katrina Ludlow wrote that her experiences at the Journal have been a “diamond in the rough” of her university education. Many other Queen’s students feel the same way about their contributions to competitive teams, art and cultural groups, or activities that help benefit fellow students. With so many of my peers considering their time out of the classroom to be the most valuable part of their experience, it’s interesting that the formal evaluation of our worth as students pays little (if any) attention to these contributions.,Universities, strapped for cash and desperate to attract not only students but also faculty and the research dollars that follow, have struggled to market themselves as the “best” in every area. In undergraduate education, that means producing graduates who have the highest marks and the best test scores. Because of this, universities have, by necessity, drifted away from an atmosphere\nof community learning and discovery, and instead choosing to focus on packing as much training on repeatable and testable technical skills as possible into the precious few years that students spend here.,I submit that this focus on meeting a measure of “excellence,” which has been defined as the ability to regurgitate a brain full of information gained through rote learning rather than on the more essential\nskills of inquiry, discovery and criticism, is doing a disservice to future generations. There’s still time to put our collective house in order. More and more, measures such as the National Survey on Student Engagement are placingpressure on universities to look beyond the base curriculum by attempting to quantify the quality of a post-secondary education without simply looking at marks, attrition and employment statistics. As for our own institution, we remain fortunate that students have created and continue to run many of the broader-learning opportunities that I mentioned above. If we value our education, and the education of our successors, we should continue to place emphasis on the\ncontinued support of experiences which will truly serve to help us contribute to the global society."},{"title":"Khan’s crossing hypocritical","url":"/story/2007-01-16/editorials/khans-crossing-hypocritical/","date":"January 16, 2007","content":"It has now been more than a week since Wajid Khan, a Mississauga MP, left the Liberal Party in favour of a more Conservative political stance.,Elected as a Liberal, Khan crossed the floor without the consent of his constituents in the Mississauga-Streetsville riding. What is perhaps even more distressing, though, is that Khan’s report on the Middle East—which was commissioned to the tune of almost $13,000 of taxpayer money while Khan was a Liberal MP, and originally intended to be made available to all parties—is now being restricted to the Prime Minister’s Office alone.,Khan has been advising Prime Minister Stephen Harper on the Middle East and South Asia since August of last year, even though he was at that time a member of the Liberal party. According to the Toronto Star, “The government paid $12,764.50 for Khan’s 19-day fact-finding mission to the Middle East.”,Spending taxpayers’ money to fund the trip is one thing, but keeping the findings for Conservative eyes only is unacceptable, especially considering Khan’s recent change of heart. The report summarizes events in the Middle East and what Canada can do to help. As promised before the trip took place, the report should be accessible to all parties—Canadians have the right to see what their money is funding. With Khan jumping the Liberal ship, it’s not surprising that those in his riding are feeling betrayed. Even if staying with the Liberals compromised Khan’s morals, his constituents deserve to have a say in his decision as he may no longer stand for the values they chose to vote into power.,Generally speaking, in our current political system most voters cast their ballots based on a party and/or party leader and rarely on the merits of an individual candidate. To quote Jeffrey Simpson in The Globe and Mail last week: “Rightly or wrongly, people in Mississauga-Streetsville supported Mr.Khan because he was a Liberal, not because he was Mr. Khan.”,For a Prime minister who campaigned on a platform of greater accountability, this affront to democracy is particularly disappointing and hypocritical."},{"title":"Happy (politically correct) holidays","url":"/story/2006-11-30/editorials/happy-politically-correct-holidays/","date":"November 30, 2006","content":"Now, is it Happy Holidays or Season’s Greetings?,This past week, residence dons received sensitivity training on how to handle the holiday season while causing the least amount of offense. The outcome—designed to make students feel less excluded by prohibiting dons from putting up Christmas lights or organizing group viewings of Christmas movies—will end up causing all students to miss out on the spirit of the season.,The dons shouldn’t be advised to take away from anyone’s religious or cultural celebration—instead, they should be encouraged to add to them. A more inclusive approach would have been to allow all types of decorations and a holiday movie week, where a variety of religious views could be celebrated.\nThe holidays should be a time of cultural exchange where people share and learn about other traditions. December festivities such as Hanukkah, Christmas and Kwanzaa should be providing outlets for celebration, not creating a culture that’s on edge about what is, and is not, politically correct.\nProblems arise when people assume that all other people celebrate their religion. Simply because the majority of Canadians celebrate Christmas—either culturally or religiously—doesn’t mean there aren’t a substantial number who are made to feel left out. If nothing else, government institutions should be expected to represent all Canadians and refrain from decorating or promoting events which are not sensitive to diversity and multiculturalism.,The cultural celebration of Christmas alone has become a dominant holiday spanning almost two months, with a predominant focus on consumerism. This may be a huge part of the animosity. Most of the beloved Christmas symbols have more to do with the selling of commodities through associations created in the media, than the actual birth of Jesus Christ. Even still, if a cultural celebration becomes\npervasive enough, it can be alienating for people who see themselves as excluded from the celebration. People of different faiths should not hold back from greeting others according to their own faith, and should not be made to feel guilty or shameful of their practices. It seems that the holidays have become so sensitive that many choose to stay safe and say nothing at the risk of offending others. The result is a bland and boring expression of what should be a joyous occasion.,As long as people accept and acknowledge the different practices of others, without crass assumptions, there should be no need to limit or censor yourself for political correctness.,Wish your friend a Happy Hanukkah and if they respond with a Merry Christmas, all the better.

Working on the mental aspect of a game can include visualization, breathing techniques, internal focusing, or even group bonding exercises, and if developed at the same time as physical skills, can provide athletes with a competitative edge.,John Phelan, a School of Business professor and mental skills coach for the NHL’s Florida Panthers, said it’s important to have a designated mental skills coach when working with teams.,“A coach may have expertise in their sport but they may not have expertise in sport psychology,” Phelan said. “But if the athlete gets it from a professional, they’re more likely to believe it.”,At Queen’s, only two varsity teams have a designated mental skills coach: women’s volleyball and figure skating. The other teams either miss out on the specialized mental component of play, or the coaches take on the responsibility themselves. Given its emphasis among coaches, it’s surprising that sports psychologists aren’t more widespread at the University.,The University should consider hiring designated professionals, trained specifically in university sport, in order to assist teams. Student athletes have many external pressures on them besides their sport, and mental training can improve balance and confidence in a distracting and high-pressure environment.,Naturally, positive self-talk and visualization don’t work for everyone. The ability to focus and perform under pressure cannot always be taught, but if methods are adapted for the individuals participating, the likelihood of success will be much greater.,A good coach should be able to motivate the team and solve most problems, but all teams should have access to a mental skills coach if they desire to use one.,Ideally, all teams would have someone in charge of mental skills, but due to funding constraints it likely isn’t feasible for all Queen’s teams to have their own mental skills coach or sport-specific psychologist on staff. The athletics department should consider hiring one or two trained professionals to provide mental skills training for all teams; or perhaps a sports councillor at Health, Councilling and Disability Services; or possibly organizing a training session for coaches on sports psychology.,Although different sports will require different mental preparation, reactions to the pressures of competition are universal. Within resources, it wouldn’t do any harm to have someone employed to help on call, if needed by a team. Mental toughness is an important aspect of sport, and shouldn’t be treated lightly."},{"title":"Dossa’s limited freedom","url":"/story/2007-01-12/editorials/dossas-limited-freedom/","date":"January 12, 2007","content":"On Dec. 11 and 12, Shiraz Dossa, a professor of political science at St. Francis Xavier University\nin Antigonish, Nova Scotia, attended the “Review of the Holocaust: Global Vision” conference held in\nTehran, Iran. Although Dossa wasn’t a Holocaust denier himself, several of the conference’s attendees included well-known neo-Nazis and past leaders of the Ku Klux Klan. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has called the Holocaust a “myth” and belives Israel should be “wiped off the map” organized the conference. Dossa has written extensively about the use of the Holocaust to justify the\ncreation of Israel and as a defense for Israeli foreign policy, and when asked to speak at the conference, he accepted.,The president of St. Francis Xavier University publicly expressed disappointment with Dossa’s decision to attend the conference, and although distancing themselves from Dossa’s endeavours, the university is considering various disciplinary measures. Although Dossa should expect considerable criticism from his academic colleagues at St.FX, the university administration should not punish or discipline him for attending the conference. Despite the nature of the conference’s subject matter and its guest\nlist, Dossa’s academic freedom must be protected.,Professors require academic freedom, especially when recognizing—rather than ignoring—that these conferences and views exist and need to be addressed. By disciplining him, the university would be denying his right to his own research. You have to wonder about the academic value and legitimacy of a conference attended by former KKK leader David Duke. However, while Dossa’s superiors may disagree with Dossa’s decision to attend, they must uphold his right to do so. If attended for the purposes he states, academic gain could come out of this controversial conference.

Last week, the Journal’s Health and Wellness supplement examined the negative effects that poor sleep and meal patterns can have on a student’s health.,But most of what we reported was—or should be—common knowledge. We all know that we should be getting at least eight hours of sleep, and yet, many of us have trouble putting our knowledge into practice. Health is seen as something that you can always deal with later—unlike that 15-page essay, due tomorrow.,This is more than just a university issue, it’s a systemic problem in our society. Western culture places enormous value on doing more and being busier. Whatever the excuse, those who choose to will always find a reason to sacrifice sleep in order to get things done. However, the competitive environment experienced at university doesn’t help.,The student who uses the extra eight hours to finish a paper, get ahead on readings or do research for a seminar, rather than using those hours for sleep, is considered to be acting productively. With a university life crammed with courses, part-time jobs and extra-curriculars, it seems that there isn’t enough time in the day to accomplish everything, including taking proper care of one’s health.\nIt may be a personal decision on how to structure priorities, but there is a substantial amount of societal pressure to focus on present gains, whatever the risk. It’s important, therefore, to look out for signs of unhealthy and possibly life-threatening behaviours in friends such as alcohol abuse, eating disorders and depression.,Students may be taking on more than they can handle, pushing themselves to extremes and their personal health and well-being to the sides. For the sake of health, students must learn to recognize their limitations, as a human being, and not look at sleep as a sign of weakness. More attention needs to be paid by professors and administration surrounding stress factors and the impact of papers and examinations on a student’s wellbeing. It’s important during these stressful months that we all watch out, not only for friends and loved ones, but also for ourselves."},{"title":"Promising guidelines","url":"/story/2007-01-16/editorials/promising-guidelines/","date":"January 16, 2007","content":"During last year’s AMS executive election, team MBT—President James Macmillan, Vice-President (Operations) Ian Black and Vice-President (University Affairs) Meghan Teuber—campaigned on a commitment to 12 promises—one for each month of the year—that, if elected, they would execute during their term. With the election of next year’s student government just around the corner, it’s the perfect time for candidates to learn how not to shoot themselves in the foot by making promises they can’t keep. Some of their initial promises worked out well, and MBT should be commended for them: Homecoming weekend was (more or less) a success, Stauffer Library was open 24 hours during exam period and All-Ages-Access was revisited and reinstated for group events. Unfortunately, other\npromises fell by the wayside. MBT told the Journal they were happy they set out goals as part of their campaign, because, as Black said, “It actually is a good guide.”,Although Macmillian, Black and Teuber should be recognized for putting themselves on the line and creating an informal contract with students, it’s disappointing that they are now referring to the promises as merely a “guide”.,Students voting in the upcoming elections should be wary of similar campaign promises. Although it’s admirable for a team to outline its goals, it’s also important that these goals be feasible, realistic and not already underway.,Year after year, AMS executive hopefuls tout ambitions plans for their year at the helm, promising that theirs will be of major changes and limitless possibilities. However, when in office, they soon discover the restraints of both time and resources. In other words, there is a ceiling to their ambition (and luckily for students, there is also a ceiling to their incompetence).,Not to take away from their accomplishments, but many of MBT’s promises succeeded because of existing and external support. It’s unrealistic that they, or anyone in their position, would accomplish much alone.,Because they aren’t trying to get re-elected, it’s bizarre that MBT said they would do everything exactly the same if given another opportunity. It would have been refreshing if MBT researched their campaign “promises” better last February because a promise is a promise—not a guide.

It’s important that students don’t neglect this chance to vote as the elected candidates will have a significant influence over the areas in which we live, work and play over the next four years. We offer our endorsements for mayor and in the wards where most students live: Sydenham, Williamsville, King’s Town and Portsmouth.,Mayor: Rick Downes,Rick Downes is the best mayoral candidate running in this election, primarily because, if elected, he plans to focus on the needs of Kingston residents without being blinded by dollar signs. Downes’s top concerns include humanitarian issues, poverty and social services—all of which are core-needs which the city must address. Although his tendency to get overly emotional at council meetings occasionally stands in the way of his good ideas, the passion and dedication he will bring to the mayor’s office are unparalleled and will be a refreshing addition to the city.,While the incumbent Harvey Rosen has accomplished a great deal during his tenure as mayor, his single-minded business approach to politics is not enough to properly serve all Kingstonians. His ambitious vision for the city did lead to several major development projects, including the Large Venue Entertainment Centre (LVEC), the Market Square revitalization (and the subsequently bungled re-naming) and the Grand Theatre renovation. All worthy projects, Rosen has made great strides in terms of developing Kingston’s downtown. However, all of the projects have been marred by lack of public consultation, shady backroom deals and generally poor judgment. His desire to run the city like a business is unsettling for those who believe in issues beyond economic development. High rates of homelessness and drug addiction, as well as other social and environmental issues are pressing concerns for the incoming mayor, and these are issues that can’t be cured by economic means alone.,Rosen was an embarrassment at this year’s Pride parade, where he read from a standard, scripted tourism speech and made zero mention of queer issues; he recklessly lashed out at students after Homecoming 2005, calling for the use of water cannons at future parties (he has since apologized for his remarks); and he rarely strays from his narrow, business-centric approach to politics.,While Downes’s desire to revisit the LVEC discussion – and consider moving it from its current downtown location to the grounds where the Memorial Centre currently sits – is puzzling, the project is too far along to change course in any significant way. The LVEC issue aside (which, as we’ve pointed out, is really inconsequential at this stage), Downes’s more nuanced approach to politics and genuine concern for the people of Kingston, makes him the best candidate.,Sydenham: Nathaniel Erskine-Smith,Sydenham, the ward encompassing the majority of campus and most students, would be best represented by Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. Erskine-Smith is a passionate, genuine and informed candidate, who is dedicated to the community and student issues. The challenges he encountered starting up a panini business sparked his interest in politics, proving his ability to take initiative and use personal experiences to overcome obstacles and create solutions. While Erskine-Smith is certainly pretty green politically, he’s bright and has proven, better than any other candidate in Sydenham, a willingness to learn and to work with others co-operatively. While he will have a lot to learn if he succeeds in securing a position on council, Erskine-Smith is best-suited to represent the interests of all Sydenham residents on city council. Although the AMS did not feel any candidate in this area was worthy of endorsement, it’s essential that the representative in Sydenham has a concern and understanding of students and student issues, but also show the ability to work with those outside of the student community to mend any tension that may arise. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith is that candidate.,Williamsville: Ed Smith,Ed Smith is the incumbent council representative for Williamsville and would be in the best position to continue on in this role. He understands the issues that need to be addressed in the district, is the most experienced and one of the most pragmatic members of the current council. Kingston is in a unique position of growth right now and needs someone who can see the big picture in order to keep the city moving forward. Smith’s business interests in the city (namely, his ownership of Windmills Café and his position as chair of the Downtown Kingston Business Improvement Area) are somewhat unsettling, but hopefully they won’t impede or influence his political decisions.,King’s Town: Rob Hutchison,Rob Hutchison would best represent the residents of King’s Town. He is well informed in both local and national political issues and, unlike Mark Potter, actually lives in the district. Hutchison ran for the NDP in the federal election this past January, where he was one of the strongest candidates trying to unseat House Speaker, Peter Milliken. Hutchison will bring experience in politics and specific municipal issues, such as affordable housing (through his work with the XX) to create practical and real solutions to pressing problems.,Portsmouth: Mark Gerretsen,In the area of Portsmouth, Mark Gerretsen is the ideal candidate. Having recently attended both St. Lawrence College and Queen’s University, his knowledge and appreciation of student issues are readily apparent. In addition, he has also been a landlord of both student and non-student rental properties. Gerretsen’s varied experiences and youthful angle on politics will prove valuable when trying to balance student interests with those of the larger community. Gerretsen has the knowledge and level-headed approach that can only be achieved from someone that has been on all sides of the situation.,We encourage all students to exercise their right to vote on Monday. Complete voting information can be found on page seven.

When discussing the new location, Tran said, “It’s something you can’t control as much, so I’m going to target the stigma.” The truth is, the change of location is the only plausible explanation for such a rastic decline in visits to the Foodbank. Yes, stigma continues to exist around foodbank usage, and although that may explain a lack of visitors in general, it fails to explain such a drastic reduction in use from one year to the next, especially when considering that other Ontario universities aren’t seeing similar decreases. Any change in location merits extensive advertisement and promotion to make students aware of the move. Clearly, students aren’t aware. It also seems unlikely that the decline\nhas anything to do with changes to the anonymity of the service. If anything, the new location on Barrie Street is even more anonymous than before.,The new Food Locker Program, hopefully in place by the end of the month, was inspired by a similar program that has been successful at other universities. Although the locker service is a step in the ight direction, it doesn’t eliminate the need to better advertise the Foodbank’s new location. The Foodbank is important to many members of the student body and ignoring the issues causing its ecline will only decrease its use further. Something needs to be done immediately to ensure this vital\nservice continues to benefit those students who depend on it. There are numerous modes of\ncommunication that can be used to get the word out such as the new updated AMS website, posters and also using the office ofthe AMS VP (operations) to send a mass e-mail out to students. Speaking of the AMS, if the Foodbank is unable (due perhaps to budget constraints) or unwilling to better promote their new location, the AMS should take responsibility and step in to do it for them.,VP (operations) Ian Black says, “Consistency and location, I think, will be advantageous over the next five years.” Now, where was that thinking when the AMS decided to switch the locations of the Greenroom and Tricolour Market after those services had only existed for a year? The construction of the Queen’s Centre is forcing both the AMS and the University to find transitional spaces for several ervices; and admittedly, getting stuck in the basement of Macgillivray-Brown Hall is kind of a raw deal for the Foodbank. That said, having a bad location doesn’t mean you shouldn’t tell anybody about it."},{"title":"Research in the classroom","url":"/story/2006-10-27/editorials/research-classroom/","date":"October 27, 2006","content":"It has recently come to the attention of many students that their professors are spending more time on research, and less on teaching. It’s not only the fault of the school or its professors; it’s a systemic problem of universities becoming more research-intensive and less focused on undergrad education, mainly for the purposes of funding.,As Kim Richard Nossal told the Journal, “The teaching function of the university is negatively affected by an increasing emphasis on research.”,Many students and faculty choose to be a part of this university based on its prestige. With such a renowned reputation for research, it’s hard to expect—or demand—more from an undergraduate experience. It’s unfortunate that professors have taken so much heat for something that is often beyond their control. Especially with new professors, research takes priority when tenure evaluations come up. In order to publish regularly, they need to focus primarily on their research. Moreover, as\nprofessors supervise more graduate students, undergraduate teaching—a difficult measure to quantify—often falls to the bottom of their priority list.,One way to alleviate the increasing tension between students and faculty would be for professors to bring their research into the classroom and use it as a teaching tool. If they were able to showcase their research, and relate it to what the class is studying, it would help to engage students in the material. The best professors are able to balance both research and teaching, and by integrating the\ntwo and including students in their work, they may be able to lecture more passionately in their class.\nAlthough it’s surprising that students are not speaking up about what some are calling a “Zellers education”, they may be protesting in a less vocal way—by not attending classes. Of course students expect a quality education but they have no concept about what university life used to be like. How can we demand a better education when our knowledge and understanding of what university could be is limited to our own personal experience?"},{"title":"RCMP wrong to raid, judge rules","url":"/story/2006-10-24/editorials/rcmp-wrong-raid-judge-rules/","date":"October 24, 2006","content":"Last Thursday, Ontario Superior Court Judge Lynn Ratushny ruled in favour of Juliet O’Neill—an Ottawa Citizen journalist whose house was raided by the RCMP two years ago for information she had related to the Maher Arar case.,It was suspected that someone from within the RCMP had leaked information to O’Neill, who refused to name her sources. The police then used the Security and Information Act to justify raiding her house.\nOn Friday, The Globe and Mail reported that Judge Ratushny said in her concluding statements: “so-called anti-leakage provisions in the Security and Information Act are unacceptably broad, vague and wide open to abuse by authorities who would seek to chill diligent journalism.” Ratushny’s judgement acknowledges the unequivocal necessity of the freedom of the press in a healthy democracy, and also calls into question all of the security laws that were rushed through the House of Commons after Sept. 1, 2001.,The current act states that anyone providing, receiving or hearing confidential information may face a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. Government is in the process of revising the law. This case serves as a reminder that it isn’t just the application of laws in need of constant reviewing, but also the content of laws.,Although O’Neill was originally threatened with criminal charges, those charges were dropped and she will receive all of her documents back. O’Neill was simply doing her job by investigating the Arar case o the best of her abilities and gathering as much information as possible. The RCMP was undoubtedly in the wrong and it’s too bad that it took so long for the justice system to recognize this.,Hopefully the landmark ruling on press freedom and freedom of expression will prevent abuses of power like this in the future."},{"title":"Grozelle’s parents deserve answers","url":"/story/2006-10-31/editorials/grozelles-parents-deserve-answers/","date":"October 31, 2006","content":"Royal Military College student, 21-year-old Joe Grozelle, disappeared in the early morning on Oct. 22, 2003 and was found three weeks later in the Cataraqui River. The most disturbing aspect of this, however, is that after two separate autopsies the cause of his death is still not confirmed.,As reported in Friday’s Edition of The Kingston Whig Standard, Grozelle’s family was sent home and the jury was dismissed last Thursday, after five days of testimony, because of what the coroner called an “issue of fairness.” The inquest should resume as soon as possible, if for nothing else but to give Grozelle’s parents an opportunity to reach some sort of closure to their son’s mysterious death over three years ago. The inquest has already undergone serious delay, and should reopen as soon as possible to limit the financial and emotional burden it is causing Grozelle’s loved ones.,A new jury will be selected before the investigation is to resume, and hopefully it won’t take another three years to come up with the missing piece of this tragic puzzle."},{"title":"Let Ignatieff speak his mind","url":"/story/2006-10-17/editorials/let-ignatieff-speak-his-mind/","date":"October 17, 2006","content":"In August, Liberal leadership candidate Michael Ignatieff was interviewed on Radio-Canada’s Tout le monde en parle, where he discussed the war between Lebanon and Israel.,During the interview, Ignatieff said he wasn’t “losing sleep” over civilian deaths in Lebanon. The comment went largely unnoticed, but suddenly reappeared when Igatieff was interviewed on Tout le monde on Oct. 8 and asked to clarify his August comment.,“I showed a lack of compassion,” he said in French. “It was a mistake. And when you make a mistake, even off the cuff, one must admit it.”,“I was a professor of human rights. I am also a professor of rights in war. And what happened in Qana was a war crime. And I should have said that, that's clear.”,What followed after Ignatieff denounced as a “war crime” Israel’s missile strike on the Lebanese village, in which 28 civilians died, could only happen in today’s political world:,Susan Kadis, MP for Thornhill—a Toronto riding with a large Jewish population—withdrew her support for Ignatieff’s campaign. She was the co-chair for his Toronto-area campaign; Prime Minister Stephen Harper accused most of the Liberal leadership candidates of exhibiting an anti-Israel bias;,Ariela Cotler, the wife of Liberal MP Irwin Cotler and a prominent Jewish community leader, said she tore up her Liberal membership card because of Ignatieff’s remarks;,Ignatieff, while not retracting his comment, later said war crimes were “committed on both sides” of the war. Last Friday he said he would visit Israel next month.,Whether or not Ignatieff is the right person to lead the Liberal party (and possibly the country) isn’t the point of rehashing last week’s hoopla; the problem is the knee-jerk reaction that arises after a public figure speaks critically about Israel and the Middle East or any other major international conflict.,Ignatieff should be able to criticize Israel’s bombing in Qana without fearing for his political life —especially since President Olmert later apologized for the civilian deaths, and human rights groups called the bombing a war crime.,What’s more, anyone who makes an intelligent criticism about Israel shouldn’t fear being labeled an anti-Semite. The rush to shower hate upon Ignatieff is counter-productive to speaking openly about a complicated international issue."},{"title":"Sukaina's death still a priority","url":"/story/2006-10-13/editorials/sukainas-death-still-priority/","date":"October 13, 2006","content":"Sukaina Mohsin Ali, a first-year international student from Pakistan, died in her West Campus residence room over six months ago, and students are still waiting for answers.,Ali had been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and depression before coming to Queen’s in 2005, and her psychiatrist in Pakistan sent the University a letter informing them of her medical conditions saying that while she saw no reason why Sukaina would be unable to cope with a full-time study schedule, but “of course, she would need monitoring by a general physician and counselor.” According to some of her friends, Ali didn’t know she could receive health services or councelling for free.,In April, Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane announced that the University was opening up an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Ali’s death, and that a report would be completed by the end of the summer. Six weeks after the administration’s self-imposed deadline there is still no further information.,The Journal scheduled numerous appointments with Deane to discuss the report, but unfortunately his office cancelled them, saying only that the report was still a priority. If the administration was running behind their own schedule it would have been appreciated for Deane to keep his appointments to show students that information wasn’t being withheld.,Although the Health, Counselling and Disability Services have appropriate and well-defined confidentiality codes, it is also their responsibility to ensure the information they receive allows students to get the help they need on a day-to-day basis. Filing away a letter into a students’ file will not assist them if they are unaware they can even make an appointment. The letter sent by Ali’s psychiatrist was meant for people to know about it, yet somehow nobody claims to have seen it. The system needs more specific communication and confidentiality guidelines so that their policies can be put to good use.,While such an in-depth report should be carefully attended to, by not going public, even with the status of the report status it appears as if the University is hiding something. It’s important that members of the Queen’s community are kept up-to-date, and if a preset date was no longer feasible, it should at least have been acknowledged. It’s fine if the administration needs more time, but they shouldn’t let deadlines pass without any explanation."},{"title":"Preventing date rape","url":"/story/2006-10-20/editorials/preventing-date-rape/","date":"October 20, 2006","content":"The Ontario government has recently announced their proposed legislation targeted at preventing date rape by making it legal to take drinks into bar bathrooms. The bill aims to prevent the administration of date rape drugs on unsuspecting victims.,As reported in The Globe and Mail, Government Services Minister Gerry Phillips said “Patrons will never have to leave their drink unattended and risk someone slipping them drugs or otherwise tainting their beverage.”,The proposed bill recognizes that date rape is still very much an issue in Ontario, especially among the student-aged population. Allowing women to bring their drinks with them throughout the entire bar will give them the ability to keep an eye on any suspicious substances entering their beverage.,However, there has been some mixed reaction to the proposed law. There is concern that it will place the burden and responsibility of sexual assault on women. While that argument does bear some merit, this new law cannot be seen as anything but a positive step forward. The law (which is already in place in other provinces such as Alberta and British Columbia) simply gives women the ability to protect their own drink. It gives women the choice to do what they wish with their glass, rather than forcing them to leave it unattended when nature calls.,While it does not address the larger issue or root causes of sexually motivated violence against women, it is certainly a worthwhile attempt to improve safety in bars. Other hurdles that will arise, if it goes through, are difficulties for bars who would need to license stairwells and hallways in order to actually put the law into place. The Queen’s Pub, for instance, comes to mind.,It’s important that students are not ignorant--date rape does happen. It’s unfortunate but true; women need to watch their drinks, not just at bars and clubs, but at house parties as well. Although it may be a hassle to find a place to put your drink while in the washroom, the consequences of having to leave a drink outside without supervision is much greater.,It’s nice to see that the Rape/Aggression Defense courses offered by Campus Security are all filled up for the rest of the dates in October and November. Hopefully, this free course will continue in the future and other female students can take advantage of this useful self-defense program so they are able to better protect themselves--in any situation."},{"title":"No other word but hate","url":"/story/2006-10-20/editorials/no-other-word-hate/","date":"October 20, 2006","content":"I love reading “Overheard in Kingston” when readers send them in, and these days I find myself listening in a little more to other people on the street. Some of what I hear, though, isn’t funny.,Don’t get me wrong—this is coming from a girl who was once chewed out by a police officer for yelling the word “bacon” from a moving car on the main street of my hometown. But that’s a little different; I was 15, and the officer had just missed the first few grocery items we were randomly yelling.,I’m talking about something much more serious than playing a game in high school.,In the past few weeks, I’ve heard people yell “Fatty!” at an obese man walking down the street, and some idiot guy yelling “Ugh, I need to eat something!” at a girl who was very thin.,One night in the Hub,a bunch of boys yelled “Emo fags”—whatever that means—at my friends and I.\nTwo arguing boys who were asked by a woman to “use their indoor voices” in Burger King one night urned to her and said “Fuck off. Men are speaking here.”,A few weeks ago, Florence Li wrote a signed editorial about a man walking past her quoting a racist and sexist line from Stanley Kubrick’s film Full Metal Jacket. For some reason, people seem to think that you can get away with more in public spaces than you can in more intimate environments.,It’s as though turning to the guy beside you in class and saying “Hey fatty, why don’t you go on a diet?” is not okay, but it’s fine if you say it while you pass him on the street. How do sizeist, sexist and homophobic hate speech become acceptable when shouted by a complete stranger in public?,Obviously fear and intimidation are key in allowing these kinds of incidents to take place, as the humiliated victim is not likely to respond to this unexpected affront, thinking perhaps that the speaker is representing something that everyone else is thinking as well. Passersby are unlikely to get involved, and so the whole interaction goes completely unaddressed. I’m no different. I’ve never spoken up either. I didn’t consider it worth my time. Was I intimidated, or did I just not know what to say? But there is danger in that.,The fact that privileged, educated students buy into world views that rate people on scales of weight, gender, sexuality, race and any other prejudice is disturbing. At Queen’s we hear all this hype about being the future leaders of Canada, about being the best students in the country, and while we have so many clubs and campus groups defending human rights around the world, we’re willing to let injustices take place when it’s committed by some drunk guy on University Avenue.,If we accept hate speech in our everyday public exchanges, who is to say that we will not then accept hate violence? If hate speech is allowable in the street, when will it be allowable in the classroom or the courtroom? We need to start calling hate speech what it is, when it happens."},{"title":"Superstition & my blue box","url":"/story/2006-10-13/editorials/superstition-and-my-blue-box/","date":"October 13, 2006","content":"Superstition: irrational belief; a widely held but unjustified idea of the effects or nature of a thing. (Oxford Canadian Dictionary),I’m not sure when the last time a coincidence like this has happened—our 13th issue of the year has fallen on Friday the 13th. Remarkable enough, especially for those who are superstitious. And although I don’t directly count myself as a superstitious person, there is one quality that I exhibit to a degree of superstition—and that is my role within our environment, so I was surprised to see the Journal’s Green Supplement appearing in this issue. Personally, I’m a bit superstitious about my blue box. If I don’t recycle everything that is possible, I feel horrible about it. I fear that if I don’t recycle, I’ll be wading through garbage in the streets by the time I’m 35. Although I’m questioned sometimes with, “Do you actually think that one can is going to make a difference?” The thing is, I don’t know if my actions are going to make a difference, but I do know that by not recycling, the situation isn’t getting any better. So I don’t mind spending half an hour every Tuesday night flattening pizza boxes.,I think people sometimes feel that preventative environmental measures, like recycling, are too alienating. What I mean is that after I toss a can into a blue box, I can’t imagine how much it’s going to improve our environment. And I believe a lot of people feel like I do--unsure of how their contributions are helping. So, on this day of leaning ladders and unlucky numbers, I wanted to share seven ideas that I think could be incorporated into your lifestyle without too much effort or damage to your wallet, and that would visibly change your immediate environment:,1. Compact fluorescent bulbs: These lighting gems use an astounding 75 per cent less energy and last about eight times longer than a standard incandescent bulb. Although they cost a bit more, you’ll save money on only changing it once every few years.,2. Dimmer switches: Something you might want to bug your landlord about, dimmer switches give you the ability to control the level of brightness in your bedroom, in turn controlling the amount of energy you use. And it will up your romantic quotient—because everyone looks great in soft lighting.,3. A&P blue bags: This past summer, A&P introduced grocery bags that can be used repeatedly. Made of sturdy fibers and costing about a buck, these bags can support about fifty pounds.,4. Buying locally: By buying local produce and other goods, you essentially save on transport and refrigeration costs that would have been involved with food travel, which is why I think the indoor student farmers market, opening on Monday in the JDUC, is such a great idea.,5. Plastic your windows: Not the most glamorous of options, and somewhat like living in a plastic bubble, covering your windows in plastic cuts down on drafts and saves you money on your utility bills.,6. Use a travel mug: By bringing your own mug, you save another ending up in the trash. And most coffee shops like the incentive and will offer you a discount on your morning brew.,7. Composting: Composting is probably the most proactive idea on this list, which is why I left it to lucky number seven. Vermicomposts provide a student-friendly option for composting. They use worms to breakdown organic waste and you can store it in your kitchen. This is especially useful when you consider that, on average, 40 percent of household garbage is food waste."},{"title":"VIA madness","url":"/story/2006-10-27/editorials/madness/","date":"October 27, 2006","content":"Canada’s National Railway system, today known as VIA Rail, has come to a sad and pitiful state. The once great transportation system that connected the country from sea to sea has taken a steep nose dive in the customer service department. And the worst part is, they could be truly great.,Trains are one of the cheapest and often the fastest way to get from point A to B. Basically, they beat the bus. They’re scenic, comfy and my tall friends tell me they win hands down for leg room. You also make friends when you split cabs back to the Ghetto. And best of all, what many people don’t know, is they’re an economically viable travel alternative.,VIA, however, likes to keep that fact hidden. I was almost finished my first year at Queen’s before I discovered the VIA 6 pack. It’s 6 one-way tickets between any two locations at a significant discount. From Kingston to Toronto it’s $42 each way, Kingston to Montreal is $41. Pretty good considering the Tricolour bus goes for roughly $30 to Toronto and Montreal, takes considerably longer and doesn’t have anywhere near the number departure dates and times.,This deal however, is not for the faint of heart and, more importantly, not for the unorganized student.,These 6 packs must be purchased in 1 lump sum and with an International Student Identification Card (ISIC). And here’s the kicker--if you lose that tiny piece of paper, none of the tickets are valid, period. No refunds or exchanges, you’ve lost whatever you haven’t used. They have a computer system but VIA is making major dollars off of student ineptitude. Not only do you have to have the tiny piece of paper present but you also have to have your ISIC at every visit as well.,An added bonus is, even though you’ve prepaid for your tickets, you’re unable to reserve actual seats online.,The reserve system is another major aspect of VIA that desperately needs to be overhauled. You can reserve a seat by phone but you have to be there 45 minutes beforehand. After that, they freely give your seat away, believe me, I know.,Anyway, no matter what you do, don’t forget your ISIC. The Kingston station last year stopped taking pictures for these cards so you can’t purchase another one at the station, unless you’re carrying around a picture of yourself. Cutting up other cards or expired ISICs to reuse the picture is also a no-no. My advice is to borrow a pair of scissors for a “luggage” problem and snip outside of the desk jockey’s view.,The worst part about all of this is that I will continue to take the train home. It cuts my travel time almost in half. When I’m on any kind of break I generally just want to get home and often don’t care what it takes, I just want to be there. What really bugs me is that I display the type of average teenage idiocy that VIA Rail capitalizes on in their bottom line."},{"title":"For those about to rock","url":"/story/2006-10-17/editorials/those-about-rock/","date":"October 17, 2006","content":"Since I came to Queen’s four years ago, I’ve attended about 150 concerts, both on and off campus. There are few more satisfying feelings than walking home sweaty and exhausted after a great show. Conversely, there are few things more irritating than leaving a venue covered in strange bruises and someone else’s beer with repeated shouts of “Play some Skynrd!” ringing in my ears. A few simple pointers on concert etiquette can preserve the safety, sanity, and enjoyment of everyone in attendance.,Once a band verbally declines an audience request, don’t keep yelling for the same song. Also, anyone who requests “Freebird” more than once at any show should be removed from the venue.,Singing along is fun for everyone, except when you are singing louder than the band and the rest of the crowd. If you don’t know the words, don’t make them up. No one paid $10 to listen to you play Mad Libs.,There might be people who would pay $10 to watch you stick your tongue into someone’s tonsils while ramming backwards into random crowd members in the heat of your passion, but they aren’t at the show.,No one is waiting for you to announce how much you know about the band’s discography, equipment, gig history or probable setlist. That’s what the Internet is for, where no one can hear you drone.,Expect at least mild jostling at the front of any energetic rock show; wearing open-toed or flimsy shoes is almost always a poor idea. “Mild jostling” does not mean people should be elbowing you in the head. If you try to start a mosh pit, and no one else around you seems interested in joining, stop it before you hurt someone. Be very careful of broken glass. In the event of consensual moshing, slam dancing, or crowd surfing, be responsible and keep an eye out for everyone else’s safety too.,Dancing is good. Hitting the people around you while flailing wildly is not. Be aware of where your body is at all times, including your hair, which may be smacking the person behind you in the face.,In a tightly packed space full of strangers, it is inevitable that you will eventually accidentally touch someone you don’t know inappropriately or spill a drink on them. When this happens, apologize briefly and sincerely. Do not start wiping the drink off the spillee, which takes you from “clumsy” to “creepy,” or interrupt their enjoyment of the show every five minutes to apologize more profusely.,If you are six feet tall, you probably don’t need to be in the front row. Short people that everyone can see over should be allowed near the front as a courtesy. However, the vertically-challenged that show up after the opening act or during the headliners do not have a right to push their way to the stage. Get there on time and suffer through The Alexander Hamilton Neutron Project like everyone else. If you need to talk through The Alexander Hamilton Neutron Project, stand near the back. If you need to talk through everything, leave.,Lastly, concerts should be a great place to meet people, so don’t stare straight ahead or talk only to your friends when nothing else is happening. You share at least one interest with everyone else there—and hopefully, you also share some common sense."},{"title":"The Thanksgiving battle","url":"/story/2006-10-03/editorials/thanksgiving-battle/","date":"October 3, 2006","content":"No doubt about it: as Queen’s students, we pride ourselves on our prestige. We see ourselves as intellectual individuals with class. Why then are we incapable of lining up like civilized people? For most Queen’s students, it’s that time again: luscious pumpkin pie, seasoned stuffing, and oh that tangy cranberry sauce on a slice of roasted turkey. Call it human nature, but daily Kraft dinner and shake & bake just doesn’t do it for one’s appetite (or health) after a while. Hence the annual bus battle of who gets home to the feast quickest.,Second to Reading week, Thanksgiving holiday at Queen’s is a long-awaited mid-term break. Most in-province students take the brief break to see loved ones and mooch off their food, or to otherwise reunite with some comrades of days past. Assuming that, then puzzling is our keenness for learning, that desperation to return to Queen’s on Sunday night. At least from my past two years, it’s an even bigger battle at Scarborough Station, with pushing and shoving and scratching and ‘budding’ to throw our luggage into the trunk, thus guaranteeing our seats on the bus.,I consider myself a veteran. After my first Thanksgiving return during first-year, I remember resolving to arrive at the station earlier the next year, in order to avoid the mayhem. To my horror, the return bus battle my second year was even more disorderly. Once the buses arrived, the many divergent ‘lines’ dispersed, and soon students from all directions were flocking towards the drivers. The struggle was so ridiculous that my mom compared us to fleeing refugees—torn from our loved ones amidst chaos and confusion.,Forget procedure by common sense, respect, and honouring the ‘first-come first serve’ rule. Can we blame it on carnivorous urgings or a draft of home-sickness? Are we just plain rude?,To be fair, the Tricolour bus system lacks, if any, a consistent protocol for students in terms of loading buses. In my experience, some drivers take tickets at the door (from whoever succeeds in shoving his or her ticket at the driver’s face). Other drivers load luggage first and take tickets later, guessing whether they will have enough seats.,Those are just two variations of the Tricolour “procedure.” More appalling are incidences where seats run out and students are forced to wait for the next coach, be it in five minutes, or even hours later.,My point isn’t to criticize the Tricolour bus system per se, but instead our demeanour in light of the situation. It’s true that we cannot help the disorganization of the system, but we can at least be courteous to one another.,Besides, Tricolour Express is finally offering two Toronto returns on Sunday, in which we hope will relieve this Thanksgiving madhouse.,Cutting the line and pushing each other doesn’t exactly call for efficiency. It should be our responsibility as smart individuals to restrain our selfishness and use our brains. After all, as Queen’s students, we are intellectual, educated, and civilized people.,So let’s keep it classy."},{"title":"Daylight savings can’t save us","url":"/story/2006-10-31/editorials/daylight-savings-cant-save-us/","date":"October 31, 2006","content":"I woke up Sunday morning with a start. A quick look at my alarm clock confirmed what I had feared—I had overslept. That ambitious plan of showing up at Stauffer as soon as the doors were thrown open to eager keeners such as myself was clearly thwarted.,A quick look at my computer, however, brought me out of my minor panic mode, as a little pop-up reminded me of an event which took place the night before.,No, the pop-up wasn’t a warning of embarrassing photos already posted and tagged. It was a kind little reminder that, hours previous, the clock had shifted from 2:00 a.m. to 1:01 a.m.,Thanks to Daylight Saving Time, I had beaten the clock. Despite oversleeping, I got up on time. Feeling triumphant, I headed off for a productive morning at Stauffer.,On a study break, I ran across the street to Tim Horton’s to pick up a much-needed caffeinated beverage (my third of the day), grabbing a copy of Sunday’s Toronto Star on my way out. Back at my cubicle, I check out the cover story: Is Sleep Obsolete?,The answer doesn’t even require a moment of thought: Yes.,Especially during the frantic few weeks known as mid-term season, sleep has become less and less of a priority, and more of a privilege.,Recognizing the importance of a good night’s sleep, I have spent the past couple weeks planning my snooze time carefully: I allowed myself five (sometimes six, if I was feeling lenient or particularly tired) hours of sleep a night, and not a minute more. I couldn’t afford to waste a precious minute of study, work and social time.,And with the decrease in sleeping time came an obvious increase in caffeine consumption. That one steaming mug of coffee that used to give me the perk I needed in the morning turned into multiple cups of coffee and tea, gulped on the go throughout the day.,According to Stanley Coren, head of the Human Neuropsychology and Perception Laboratory at the University of British Columbia, you lose one IQ point every day you sleep only seven hours, rather than the recommended eight. Penalties for less sleep are even worse: Coren says lose two IQ points for every hour short of seven. While sleep can apparently help rejuvenate the lost intelligence, it takes its toll.,Scary? Yeah. But is it scary enough to make me factor in a solid eight hours of sleep a night? Not quite.,As Coren said in the Star article: “You go without sleep and you’re the hard-hitting, jet-setter, prime-mover kind of character.” It seems there’s a never-ending list of things to do, whether obligations or opportunities. The less sleep you get, the more productive you are, right? The more caffeine, the more alert?,Well, no.,Not sleeping means your body doesn’t have time to ‘repair’ themselves overnight, making you increasingly drowsy throughout the day. Caffeine grants a quick jolt, only to bring you crashing down even lower.,The sad thing is: none of this is news to anyone.,With awareness of the importance of sleep rising, it’d be nice to look forward to a future of nights of nine-plus hours of sleep, of guilt-free siestas, and of a time when coffee was enjoyed, not inhaled.,I wish I could say that I’m taking note, that I’m going to adopt the “early to bed, early to rise” mantra.,But it’s nearing 2:30 a.m. as I write this, and being prepared for a midterm mere hours away takes precedence over the lifelong guarantee of riches and wisdom. Sleep, again, is put on hold and this time, no extra hour will miraculously appear to save me."},{"title":"The truth you should handle","url":"/story/2006-10-24/editorials/truth-you-should-handle/","date":"October 24, 2006","content":"Last Thursday night my housemate and I went to A&P to pick up a few household items. It was late, close to 1:30 a.m., and the store was almost empty. After we had found what we were looking for we stood in line and browsed the headlines of tabloids and celebrity gossip magazines and were altogether paying very little attention to our surroundings. Feeling utterly unsympathetic toward the fact that Tara Reid had a plastic surgery nightmare, I noticed the person in front of me in line. I had seen him wandering around the store but I thought very little of him until the cashier asked for I.D. to verify his VISA card.,He shifted uncomfortably, pressing his back against the counter behind him as he rifled through his wallet. That’s when I noticed he had something large and round shoved up under the back of his shirt. He was stealing. The cashier hadn’t noticed anything odd apart from the fact that he said he didn’t have a driver’s license and it was his dad’s card anyway and all she did was lecture him about always carrying I.D.,I’m ashamed to admit that I didn’t say a word. I am almost more ashamed to say that, upon realizing what was happening, the first thought to cross my mind was “It’s got nothing to do with me; it’s not my responsibility to say anything.” It may have been the most blatant lie I have ever tried to tell myself because the truth is that it was no one’s responsibility more than it was mine.,I’m usually the kind of person who believes I deserve to have a say in the things that happen around me. I want to be in the loop and I’m not shy about voicing my opinions about the things that matter to me.,Why, then, when faced with the opportunity to speak up about something that should be important to all of us, did I suddenly lose my nerve?,I think the short answer is fear. I had no idea what would happen if I were to speak up and I was so concerned with avoiding what would certainly have been an uncomfortable, though undoubtedly temporary, situation that I let my fear outweigh my urge to say what I felt.,Our fixation with avoiding personal conflict has grown so big that we are willing to put a person’s right to be left alone ahead of our own right to stand up for what’s right.,All for the sake of avoiding an awkward situation.,Life is full of awkward situations.

These changes will allow U.S. public schools to create “separate but equal” classrooms based on gender divisions. Individual elementary and high schools will be allowed complete discretion over implementing gendered subjects, grades or entire institutions.,The Bush administration feels that children will be more likely to succeed if surrounded by others of their same gender. Unfortunately, this isn’t getting at the root of the problem. If certain children feel intimidated in the classroom by members of the opposite sex, this points to how they are being raised and socialized—not to an inherent inability to learn with the opposite sex, or a problem with the school system.,Also, the new law assumes that every student will fit neatly into one category or the other. It completely ignores transgender issues and those students who feel they cannot identify as either males or females.,These changes are also teaching youth to avoid problematic situations and preventing them from facing their fears. Every individual has a different way of learning, which has nothing to do with their sex or gender. Students have various interests, needs and motivations regardless of their gender, and high-quality teachers should be able to recognize this in the current co-ed classrooms and tailor their teaching methods accordingly. Moreover, boys and girls can learn from each other.,Telling children that they learn a certain way because they are male or female encourages discrimination. It’s normal for young children and adolescents to feel uncomfortable with the opposite sex from time to time but separating them so they no longer have to deal with each other anymore doesn’t address the problem. Students will always have to participate in intimidating and nerve-wracking activities that they would rather avoid, but they will learn from them and their comfort level will improve.,There are other, more logistical problems, that also need to be addressed. With artificial divisions, one class will inevitably be smaller, and will therefore receive more attention from the teacher. Since it’s doubtful that the government will be pouring any more resources into teaching, the additional load will be taken up by existing teachers and the quality of education is bound to suffer.,This is a narrow-minded and poorly thought out solution to what Bush and the U.S. government see as a problem; it will only serve to reinforce existing stereotypes, and will regress our education system back to a time when gender roles and expectations were so narrowly defined."},{"title":"Produce more, pollute more","url":"/story/2006-10-17/editorials/produce-more-pollute-more/","date":"October 17, 2006","content":"Last week Stephen Harper announced that his government’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be “intensity-based.” The new strategy is intended as an alternative to the Kyoto protocol, which was originally ratified by Canada, but abandoned when the Conservative government came to power in January.,The new “intensity-based” strategy will require industries to reduce emission levels relative to their economic output. So, if you produce more, you can pollute more. This stands in contrast to Kyoto’s call for an absolute reduction in emission levels.,Under the new strategy Canada’s overall emission levels could potentially increase, as long as its economic output also increases. And considering that the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers forecasts that crude-oil production in Canada will double between 2005 and 2020, this appears to be a likely scenario.,When the Conservative government abandoned Kyoto, Harper said they were developing a “Made in Canada” solution to combat climate change. The fact of the matter is that the crisis of global warming is a  problem, and therefore requires global co-operation. By pulling out of Kyoto, Harper took a huge step backwards with regards to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.,No one would ever suggest that the Kyoto protocol is perfect, or capable of providing a cure-all solution to climate change in its current state. But it’s certainly a healthy start.,Kyoto’s voluntary objectives, as well as the absence of the world’s two biggest polluters—the United States and China—certainly limit its effectiveness, but Canada’s involvement could have shown some global leadership by encouraging other countries to rise to the challenge. Canada’s abandonment of the protocol only makes it easier for other countries to do the same.,An obvious problem with the “intensity-based” approach is that it’s softest on the biggest polluters. The more a company produces, the more it’s allowed to pollute.,This is especially distressing not only because large corporations are usually the largest polluters, but also because, as profit-driven entities, businesses should demand the most stringent regulations.,It may be possible to appeal to an individual’s moral conscience, but large corporations are less likely to voluntarily reduce their emissions at the expense of their bottom lines.,What this ultimately means, then, is that because businesses will not be expected to do their part in combating climate change, the onus is upon individuals to be more environmentally conscientious in their daily lives.,Buying locally and reducing the amount of energy you regularly use are two easy ways to do your part. Yesterday’s farmer’s market in the JDUC provided students with a convenient opportunity to do the former. Hopefully we’ll see it again soon."},{"title":"Wait time strategy short-sighted","url":"/story/2006-10-13/editorials/wait-time-strategy-short-sighted/","date":"October 13, 2006","content":"In an effort to cut hospital wait-times, the government is targeting five specific surgeries for increased funding: cancer care, heart operations, cataract removal, hip and knee replacement and diagnostic imaging.,The cuts are part of a federal-provincial deal established in 2004. Admittedly, the program is a good start towards recognizing the need to reduce waiting times, but in its current state the program will pose significant challenges, both immediately and in the long run.,It’s understandable that, at some point, a clear strategy should develop in order to address the problem, but right now the government is allowing life-threatening surgeries to fall by the wayside.,Some surgeries are inherently more serious and urgent than others, but the method the government as chosen to deal with the wait problem is much too crude. Choosing five surgeries to receive funding, and then ignoring the big picture, will not ultimately improve an ailing health care system. It seems that the government is creating an easy—read:temporary—solution to show voters that the wait is decreasing, and attempting to give the public tangible and concrete examples and numbers while ignoring the overall ramifications. This is only a cosmetic band-aid solution to a much larger issue.,The treatments isolated target baby-boomers and geriatric populations, and although they represent a large group of voters, they may not reflect the needs of Canadian hospitals.,Hospitals used to have significantly more freedom on how they would use their funding but now are handcuffed by increased government restrictions—which may be detrimental to specialized surgeons, heir patients, and the entire health care system. Some hospitals need increased attention in areas other than those targeted by this program, but the government is ignoring those needs. With the focus on targeted procedures, other necessary operations will be put off, which may mean the closure of certain departments and a longer wait-time for all other surgeries. While it is understandable that the government must start somewhere to focus funding, and search for a solution to the wait-times problem, more research should have been done into the consequences for patients waiting for other surgeries right now, and the effect on the entire system down the road."},{"title":"How much is too much?","url":"/story/2006-11-03/editorials/how-much-too-much/","date":"November 3, 2006","content":"How much homework is too much? How about when it prevents a child from learning and experiencing a well-rounded life outside the classroom? The debate over the amount of homework that children are receiving has heightened in the last few years signaling a need to re-evaluate the way our education system approaches teaching, learning and designing curriculum. The amount of homework assigned isn’t a predictor of how intelligent kids will be or how much they will learn. More homework may in fact have the opposite effect as children become overworked and overwhelmed—or refuse to do anything at all.,According to the Government of Ontario website, “An estimated 30 per cent of Ontario high school students leave school without a diploma.” One cause may be that the kids who can’t keep up with the homework are becoming discouraged and quitting.,The de-valuation of a high school diploma in favour of a university BA in the workforce isn’t helping. High schools are already beginning to emphasize academic over more practical post-secondary education, and weeding out the “good” students from the rest of the class based on who can handle the homework. Only a small percentage of the population actually attends university, yet the education system caters only to those with a particular learning style, and academic aspirations.,Due to a lack of time and resources, and an increasingly demanding curriculum, students are often forced to fill in the educational gaps outside of the classroom rather than reinforcing the concepts learned in class. While maintaining a certain level of homework will help keep students engaged with the material, children should not be teaching themselves entire units after hours.,Provincial standardized tests have only increased the social emphasis on the need to show concrete results for completed work—if you can’t measure your learning in hard numbers, it’s looked at as pointless.,Our education system is increasingly catering to a specific type of learner, and any student who doesn’t learn this mainstream way is left behind. The school system doesn’t take into account the different circumstances at home, as well as different learning styles in the classroom. Some children may have a job or family responsibilities that take priority. Kids shouldn’t be sacrificing their health, or their childhood, for homework.,The onus shouldn’t be on students to learn new material, and if teachers do decide to assign homework, it should be meaningful. Reinforcing material and teaching study skills are valid reasons; bullshit homework to make a child  busy to make parents and the administration feel better is not."},{"title":"The Sydenham slight","url":"/story/2006-10-31/editorials/sydenham-slight/","date":"October 31, 2006","content":"The AMS has decided to endorse candidates in the municipal election this year—the first time in recent memory that they have thrown their support behind a group of candidates at the municipal level.,In a meeting at Kingston city hall last Thursday, AMS Assembly voted to endorse Harvey Rosen for mayor and Ed Smith for Williamsville, but decided against endorsing a candidate in Sydenham, the district the University belongs to.,Whether students agree or disagree with the specific endorsements is beside the point—at least they will be thinking critically about the candidates and the municipal election as a whole.,Though a worthwhile attempt by the AMS to increase student awareness about municipal issues, their process was flawed in a few ways. First, there were too few committee members interviewing the candidates. Of the 25 people on the Assembly, only five or six actually spoke to those running in the areas of King’s Towne, Sydenham and Williamsville. As well, the AMS refused to endorse a candidate from Sydenham, but still published the grades of the candidates. If endorsement is to be done properly it needs to be universal, and avoiding the endorsement of a candidate in the most highly contested and important district for students is spineless and frankly ridiculous.,There is nothing inherently wrong with the endorsement of municipal candidates as long as the right research is done and accurate information is given to students. Fortunately there’s still plenty of time for students to get involved and make an informed choice of their own.,The  will be doing its part to help keep students informed about the Nov. 13 election by publishing candidate profiles as wekk as those running for mayor in our Nov.3 and Nov.10 issues.

According to the New York Times, Michael J. Sandy was lured into a meeting place by the suspects that night. Sandy was attacked, robbed and forced into a busy street where he was then struck by a car. He suffered serious injuries and was in a coma until he died on Oct. 13 after his family decided to remove him from life support.,The alleged killers, three white males all between the ages of 16 and 20, include John Fox—a 19-year-old student at State University New York Maritime College.,According to the prosecutors, the men targeted Sandy because a gay man would be unwilling, or too weak, to put up a fight, and would therefore act as an easy target. This idea, if actually the motive for their murder and robbery, is ludicrous—especially coming from young, supposedly educated males. It is also a bit confusing that the prosecutor did not mention homophobia as a possible motive.,The adolescent ages of these men are surprising, for they show homophobic sentiments continuing into new generations. What is perhaps most surprising, though, is the city where this tragic event took place; New York City, the home base for the gay-rights movement, is an unlikely host for such deliberate anti-gay violence.,In this day and age, and particularly in a university environment, it’s easy to forget that this kind of hate still exists. Deliberate attacks like this show that our society has still not accepted varied sexual-orientations. Continued education and discussion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered and queer rights, are more important than ever in order to encourage acceptance and equality."},{"title":"A lecture worth our while","url":"/story/2006-10-24/editorials/lecture-worth-our-while/","date":"October 24, 2006","content":"If all that lectures are providing are PowerPoint presentations or overhead slides identical to that which students can get online from the comfort of their own home, should students really be blamed for skipping class?,Boring and redundant conducted lectures provide no incentive for students to attend class—if students do their readings and understand the material, they need to be guaranteed that attending class will not waste their time.,The website that Brian Maxwell, ArtSci ’08, set up at www.lecturetally.com provides an example of students finding a way to get what they need without going to class. Professors who post all of their slides and additional information have also been blamed for affecting attendance rates.,Although these are considerations, professors should be able to post their slides and still have a full lecture hall. If professors are finding that students are utilizing the technology that’s available to them and accessing class notes through services like Maxwell’s, they should be doing more to inspire better attendance. Students will continue to attend lectures if they are engaging, entertaining and informative beyond what could be obtained in the text or on a website.,In our increasingly competitive classrooms, where obtaining high marks for employment or further education post-graduation have taken over the sole purpose of a higher education, it’s not surprising that students who are able to do well without going to class are deciding not to go. For students to rethink why they are going to university, and appreciate a university education in and of itself, classes need to offer more than just a PowerPoint presentation lifted from the textbook.,Many professors teach courses because they have to, but it’s still part of their job. They may consider themselves as researchers or academics first and foremost, but they also have an obligation to find a coherent way to get the material across. If professors expect students to take responsibility for their education, they should be asking themselves, “What are we giving students in exchange for their commitment?”,Professors are not necessarily here because they are good at teaching—the University may want their research skills or publication attached to the school.,Perhaps the University should spend less on research and increase funding for hiring lecturers or others specifically trained to teach. Or, they could consider providing practical training to professors on how to teach undergraduate classes; a form of teachers college for professors.,Increasingly, students are thinking of university only as a mark on a transcript and the style of lectures is not helping the matter. Students need to start appreciating their education and taking advantage of the classes available, and it’s the duty of professors to make it worth their while."},{"title":"Model Parliament's Trash","url":"/story/2006-09-29/editorials/model-parliaments-trash/","date":"September 29, 2006","content":"To those who lined up for Queen’s Model Parliament on Monday: what made you think it was okay to leave your garbage for other people to pick up?

Although originally aimed at finding solutions to the Homecoming problem, the symposium shifted its focus to seven topics including identity, diversity, town-gown relations and tuition. It took an entire year for the event to finally occur due to funding, difficulty booking Grant Hall and creating a concrete set of topics. In the end, $5,500 was spent on an endeavour that probably could have accomplished just as much on a smaller scale. Darwin had big ideas for the symposium. The trouble is, they were too big.,Although hoping for around 400 participants, only 70 students, faculty, and Kingston residents attended the symposium. Most of the participants in attendance are people who are already engaged in these discussions.,While created with the best of intentions, Darwin was perhaps overly ambitious in her breadth and scope. It’s impossible to discuss seven complex topics, such as identity and diversity, with any meaningful depth when you only have 20 minutes in which to do it.,Moreover, unfortunate timing also likely played a role in the weak turnout.,The event received considerable exposure and publicity over the course of the last 12 months, but a series of marketing problems may have also contributed to the low attendance. Admittedly, bad timing affected the turnout, but students are also tired of symposiums and abstract discussions. More focus on attracting students currently uninvolved in these types of discussion may have proved a more effective approach.,Darwin was extremely dedicated to her cause and after a year of diligent planning should be commended for finally seeing the project through. Unfortunately, though Darwin said she would like to see the event occur regularly at Queen’s, there doesn’t appear to be enough momentum or willpower for it to continue in the future."},{"title":"The troublesome Maclean’s stalemate","url":"/story/2006-09-08/editorials/troublesome-macleans-stalemate/","date":"September 8, 2006","content":"Most students have come across the annual Maclean’s magazine university ranking issue. Although their editor downplays his own magazine’s influence, many students who pick up a glossy version of the Maclean’s university issue each year use it as a primary tool to assist them with choosing a university. This year, Queen’s, along with at least 21 other schools, pulled out of the survey and will no longer co-operate with the magazine to provide easy access or free range to information.,The institutions who refuse to participate claim that comparing schools and programs is like comparing apples to oranges, and the methodology the magazine’s journalists use to create a university’s score is flawed and in need of revision. Maclean’s claims the universities are not happy because journalists are serving the interests of the people, not the schools. They say the universities’ refusal to provide information is disrespectful to the Canadian public.,The magazine’s attempt to present a quantative analysis of something so inherently qualitative seems to be the larger issue, rather than from where the information is released. Most statistics are available publicly from university websites; the problems arise when that information is analyzed. This magazine can be a helpful guide, but some schools find that they are being misrepresented by what they consider to be a flawed scoring system.,It’s unfortunate the two sides could not come together to improve the survey, rather than simply shutting each other out. The resulting stalemate is frustrating for all parties involved but most frustrating for the students who value the magazine as a resource guide. Not all students have the time or money to visit schools before they accept an offer. Outside sources, such as Maclean’s, can have a strong influence on their decision. If Maclean’s focused on the profiles more than the ranking, then the sides may have been able to work together to benefit the students.,It’s very important the survey is accurate because people take it seriously, whether or not it deserves that authority. Although Queen’s and the other schools are refusing to give out additional information, Maclean’s will continue to publish the university issue just as it has in the past."},{"title":"Swipe needed more research","url":"/story/2006-10-03/editorials/swipe-needed-more-research/","date":"October 3, 2006","content":"Current AMS media and volunteer director Dan Jacobs started a program last year intended to provide a convenient service to students as recognition of their association with the AMS. The program would implement a Swipe card to act as a hybrid--debit and coupon--card that could be used at all AMS venues on campus, as well as at selected local businesses. After six failed attempts in previous years, the Swipe card program was cancelled once again at the end of the summer, after it was deemed not cost-feasible, but not before $8,410 was sunk into the project. After so many unsuccessful efforts, one would assume the AMS would do extensive research into the costs and planning involved before investing considerable monies into the program. Last year, the AMS entered into a partnership with Toronto-based company Givex, who agreed to cover all startup costs required for the program to get underway. A flaw in the plan, however, was that the AMS wasn’t notified, and didn’t inquire,  how much the project would cost. In order to fund the technology and Swipe cards for one year, Givex required the Kingston companies to put $5,000 into a floating account, which was too much to ask of small businesses for investment in a new program. When the AMS contacted Wells Hospitality, as an alternative to Givex, the estimated cost of $60,000-$65,000 was deemed unfeasible and the program was cancelled.,The AMS should have thought twice before starting up a program this large, for the seventh time, without sufficient financial information required to carry it through to the end.,Lack of institutional memory caused by the yearly turnover of students, allows these kinds of projects to consistently fail at the expense of students.,Since AMS executives spend only one year in their position, they often feel it’s important to do something big in order to leave a lasting impression. But sometimes, it takes more than a year to implement a successful program and failing to recognize that, proves an unsuccessful waste of student funds. The focus shouldn’t be on superficial attempts to make it  like a program is being worked on, but instead on background research and behind-the-scenes preparation. At least this year Mike Cotton, who was terminated from his position as Swipe coordinator, is putting together a manual for future AMS members so that hopefully the same mistakes aren’t made again. It’s unfortunate it took more than $8,000 of wasted student money for the AMS to reach this conclusion."},{"title":"Opt-out fee awareness","url":"/story/2006-09-22/editorials/opt-out-fee-awareness/","date":"September 22, 2006","content":"Today is the deadline for opting-out of AMS student fees and the health and dental plan. Hopefully this isn’t the first you’ve heard of it, although chances are it might be.,During the rush of the first few weeks of school, amidst buying books, dropping courses and soothing hangovers, many students forget they that have a choice when it comes to many of their AMS fees. Every year, a large portion of students overlook the opt-out process.,At some other schools, student governments charge one large fee and then distribute the money later as they see fit. What’s nice about our system, though it may seem tedious, is that each student has complete control over where their student club fees are going.,Queen’s prides itself on how easy it is to start a club or join one of the more than 200 existing clubs on campus. However, the number of clubs and subsequent fees are quickly growing to unmanageable levels.,Because our system is based on a “you’ve opted-in unless you tell us otherwise” structure, clubs could easily take advantage of those who are unaware. There’s always a portion of students who won’t check their fees and therefore will be paying a certain sum to each club, which adds up.,To receive the funds, each individual club gets ratified every year and its fee goes to referendum for renewal every three years. One simple mechanism that could immediately increase the accountability of a club would be for the AMS to do a better job at promoting the opt-outable fees. By doing that, clubs would have an increased incentive to prove that they’re worthy of student dollars.,It’s important the AMS increases awareness about these fees, especially for the already overwhelmed and overloaded first-year students who may be paying for things they would have otherwise chosen to avoid. Students need a reminder that this is their money, and that it’s their responsibility to log onto the website and ensure they understand where it’s going.,If the opportunity to opt-out was advertised the way some other AMS initiatives are, fewer students would be wondering where their money went."},{"title":"The Conservative funding cuts","url":"/story/2006-09-29/editorials/conservative-funding-cuts/","date":"September 29, 2006","content":"The Conservative government announced they are eliminating funding from 66 social programs tarted by previous Liberal governments, despite last year’s $13.2 billion surplus. These cuts, totaling $1 billion (with another $1 billion to be extracted through unidentified “tighter management”), include environmental programs, funding for medicinal marijuana research, museums, court challenge opportunities, programs encouraging Canadians to volunteer, and helping aboriginal people to quit smoking, among others.,In an attempt to bring down the federal debt, Stephen Harper and the Conservatives are taking away necessary social programs. When campaigning in last year’s election, one of the Conservative latforms was fiscal responsibility. The government may gain voters’ support for keeping campaign promises, but if Harper takes his mandate too far, the party will end up losing precious votes. Human rights aid and assistance for aboriginals should not be seen as trimming the fat. The Conservatives re planning to rearrange the distribution of funds; it will be interesting to see what specific programs\nthey deem more worthy of receiving the $1 billion. When questioned regarding the cuts, the government claimed that they based their decision on their campaign platform. Some service providers have bemoaned the lack of consultation throughout the process, but the Conservatives have responded by sayingthat voters were consulted at election time and they chose to support the onservative’s platform.

This nine-member group, which has been meeting since last November, is made up of representatives from Queen’s as well as the Kingston community. Unfortunately, the majority of their recommendations are much too vague and unfocused to make any significant difference.,Some suggestions targeted only incoming students with an idea to create an education program. Thankfully, the suggestion to send letters home to parents never made it to the final recommendations. Street cameras were proposed to deter illegal behaviour, but details regarding the cameras use were not provided; neither were concerns of privacy reduction adequately addressed. The goals of enforcing the noise by-law and emphasizing responsible partying do nothing to investigate the root cause of the problems, or offer concrete solutions to fixing them. Several of the committee’s recommendations are completely outside of the jurisdiction of the city and police, such as proposing to chance certain provincial liquor laws. It is shocking that there was not a greater demand for details on how these recommendations would be put into place.,The committee’s focus should have been on harm reduction, recognizing that students will continue to party, but encouraging them to do so in a safe and celebratory manner. One suggestion made by students was to hand out plastic cups in exchange for bottles in order to cut down on the number of injuries from broken glass. Students are the ones who will be making the decisions on Aberdeen on Sept. 16 this year, and it’s a shame this suggestion wasn’t a final recommendation.,By attempting to remain uncontroversial to enable the recommendations’ passage, tangible recommendations, which could have made a major difference and were within the group’s limitations, were not made.

For those in residence, however, friends will be forced to make alternate overnight arrangements. In an attempt to maintain safety, limit the burden on staff and hopefully decrease the presence on Aberdeen, a Homecoming Committee made up of various residence coordinators decided to ban residence guests for this weekend.,While the committee acknowledged that most Aberdeen Street troublemakers are not students at Queen’s, the complete elimination of guests won’t be any safer than with previous restrictions.,Principal Hitchcock sent letters to the administrations of other Ontario universities requesting that they do what they can to discourage their students from attending Homecoming this weekend. This shows the University administration would love to be able to restrict all visitors from outside the Queen’s community. However, they really only have control over residence buildings, so they’re doing what they can to limit guests any way possible.,While the restriction may be inconvenient for first-years in residence, the minor hardship is reasonable considering the circumstances. Still, it’s unfortunate that such harsh residence policing will be enforced so early in the year as students and dons are still building a relationship with one another.,Although a decent idea, the effect of having fewer visitors in residence won’t be noticeable on Aberdeen Street this year as out-of-towners will search for other means of accommodation. Restricting guests in residence likely won’t have a major impact on how the weekend plays out, but it certainly won’t hurt to have a few less people on Aberdeen."},{"title":"Pop politics","url":"/story/2006-09-29/editorials/pop-politics/","date":"September 29, 2006","content":"In Tuesday’s Journal, there was a detailed account of Stephen Lewis’ moving speech about the HIV/AIDS crisis, which took place at St. George’s Cathedral in Kingston this past Sunday. Amidst a undeniable call to action from all persons listening, Lewis’ particular comment on how more\ncelebrities than politicians were present at Toronto’s International AIDS Conference, got me thinking.,In a decade where Arnold Schwarzenegger can win elections, and Bill Clinton can trump the tabloids, it seems to me we have reached a point in time when the line between celebrities and politicians has blurred.,To be clear, when it comes to raising awareness for social causes, I think we would all agree that any press is good press, whether it comes from someone like Stephen Lewis or Bono. In fact, there seems to be no end to the good that can come from celebrity awareness. The publicity, the sheer magnitude of money that celebrities can donate and their ability to reach audiences to which the average politician might not appeal, are all undeniable reasons why celebrities can be an asset to a particular cause. The place where the seemingly flawless marriage between celebrities and social causes starts to split, however, is really three fold. First, celebrity awareness becomes tricky when the cause at hand is not something like raising money for AIDS research, but—is heavily political and has two clear sides, such as who should win an election. Celebrity influence becomes sketchy in this instance because their power over the general public is enormous. We are no longer a society that votes because it is our right and responsibility to do so, but because P Diddy told us to “Vote or Die.”,An even more pressing ramification of celebrity social and political activism is the emergence of a culture of lazy opinions, relying on public figures to make our minds up for us. It seems that there isn’t an election that goes by without some sort of celebrity following, and I believe that there’s a strengthening mentality, especially among young voters, of trust in the celebrities they admire, even in the political realm. Looking up to celebrities for their latest fashion trend is one thing, but that mindset should not be applied to political issues.,Last but not least, to borrow from the lecture of Stephen Lewis, we mustn’t forget that the trouble with the world focusing on celebrity leadership is that even though we may praise them for their effort and enerosity, perhaps we are becoming a culture that is graduallyaccepting “non-governmental organizations [as] a substitute for government interaction.” In the battle of whether celebrities help or hinder social causes, I think I can safely say that although sometimes it seems easier, and even logical to wish that Oprah would run for president, let us not allow the bright lights of Hollywood to blind us from real political support that is mistakenly missing from the forum of social activism."},{"title":"Back to school","url":"/story/2006-09-12/editorials/back-school/","date":"September 12, 2006","content":"I can’t remember when I was this excited for school. Or scared.,I always envisioned my fourth year to be smooth, seamless and, frankly, second nature. But this doesn’t happen when you switch programs at the end of your third year. Instead, I feel like I’m in first year all over again—filled with the same excitement and anxiety, only compounded because I still have yet to figure my life out, and the clock is ticking.,I have friends who are already in law school, medical school and a bunch of other professional programs, while I’m still on the fence about my undergraduate degree.,The switch from Life Sciences to English was in no way easy. I’m still not sure if I’m better at counting the carbons in a benzene derivative, or the feet in a line of iambic pentameter. I’d like to think this is a sign of maturity, that I’m finally able to make my own decisions, but in the back of my mind, I can’t help but wonder if I’m running towards something better, or away from something that was just too hard. I chose to go into science because I was good at it; in many ways, the validation I got from getting good marks, resulted in my doing better. When I came to university, everything changed. My marks were much lower than I expected and this steep drop caused my morale to drop.,For the first time in a long time I was facing problems I didn’t know the immediate answers to, and it was unsettling. And rather than trying to really figure things out on my own, I chose instead to find a scapegoat: I chose to blame all my academic woes on “the system.” Many of my friends have heard my tirades about the flaws of my former program and its inability to stretch beyond the constraints of the multiple choice test, but really what they were listening to was my own personal frustration at being unable to perform well on those tests.,Finally, after a landslide of less than amazing marks, I began to realize that these tests were making something glaringly clear: I wasn’t happy or truly engaged in what I was learning. I knew, however, I wasn’t completely lost because I was actually doing well in the English classes in which I was enrolled.,Throughout high school there was always this stigma of science being better than arts and I think it stuck with me. In applying to university I never once considered taking English or history despite garnering the most enjoyment from those classes. Science became the ultimate test of intelligence: only the smart kids went into science. I have no idea where I got this diluted notion from, but this is what I was basing my decisions on.,Upon arriving at Queen’s, I’ve met so many arts students who took science all through high school. But they chose to go into arts; it wasn’t as if they were relegated to taking arts because they weren’t smart enough to be in science.,With this in mind, I’m looking forward to my switch, occasionally looking back to remind myself of the journey that got me here."},{"title":"Racist—not funny","url":"/story/2006-09-22/editorials/racistnot-funny/","date":"September 22, 2006","content":"Here’s a story: It was an ordinary night and my friend and I were walking back home along Division Street as two guys were coming towards us. One of them looked at me and in what I presume to be some kind of Asian accent, he said “ya ya, me love you long time.” For those of you who don’t know that line, it comes from Stanley Kubrick’s 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket.,The movie tells of the experiences of three marines during the Vietnam War.,In one particular scene, the character played by Matthew Modine is sitting at a GI bar when a prostitute comes up to him and says the line, “Me so horny. Me love you long time.” They then proceed to discuss matters of payment and she tells him what he’ll receive in return.,Needless to say, when I was confronted with this line while minding my own business, I was shocked and pissed off.,Unless jeans and a Queen’s sweatshirt is the new uniform of sex trade workers, I don’t know what about my appearance would prompt him to say such a thing. Perhaps the guy thought it was funny and wasn’t trying to be offensive.,Maybe he didn’t even know what the line really meant but that doesn’t matter because within those five words, there lies a world of stereotypes and we all know that you don’t have to intend to offend someone to insult them.,The line has become as ubiquitous as “May the force be with you” or “Beam me up Scottie.” It also doesn’t help that if you turn the radio on right now, you’ll probably hear it coming from Fergie, Nelly Furtado and Jay-Z.,Whether you agree with me or not, I think it’s offensive and racist.,Thousands of women became prostitutes or “comfort women,” to American and British soldiers during the Vietnam war. Women were raped, abused and sometimes murdered by ‘enemy’ hands.,At the same time, Bangkok became the “rest and recreation” centre for the military and as many as 70,000 women worked in the red-light district to provide services for increasing demands.,That was about 40 years ago but the remnants of the past are still present, and alive and well in many countries.,I’m not out to change any minds and I’m not pointing any fingers. The line has become so overused that most people that say it probably don’t even know where it’s from, but now you do.,If you choose to say it and think it’s not hurting anybody then do what you must.

Maybe it was the “Queen’s University, Est. 1841” across the chest that appealed to me—like a subliminal message telling me that this is where I would be attending university. Whatever the reason, it tells the story of an important place in my life and many members of my family.,Going to Queen’s has been a tradition on my dad’s side of the family for a long time—and I have a small family. Since we were young, my brother and I were pretty much conditioned that Queen’s was the university that we would attend, and by Grade 8, I was doing whatever it would take to get there.,On day-trips to Kingston, my brother and I were given campus tours from my dad as we gazed out the minivan window in awe and listened to his fond memories: “When I was a boy, the campus was my playground. I used to play hide and go seek on Summerhill.” Kind of cheesy, I know, but carrying on the Queen’s tradition means a lot to him.,As a former resident of Kingston, he grew up a few short steps from campus and now, I live a block away from where he did.,In September, there will be a new addition to our Queen’s family—my brother, Joel, will be studying commerce. My parents are elated that I will be here to show him the ropes—and I take this older-sister duty with great pride.,Joel and I are three years apart and throughout our childhood, we had completely different interests. Just as he was starting to get out of the “I’m-too-cool-to-talk-to-my-sister-in-public-because-I’m-so-tough” phase, I headed off to Queen’s to begin my undergraduate journey. Although we kept in touch on MSN and through the occasional phone call, we seemed to miss the chance to establish that close sibling bond. But now I know that things will be very different in September.,My cell rang one day and I was surprised to hear Joel’s voice on the other end. “I GOT INTO QUEEN’S,” he yelled. Then I started screaming until I was drowning out his scream.,After we hung up, I realized that I was the first person he called before any of his friends. He knew it meant a lot to me to see his dreams come true. Even though we’ll only be together at Queen’s for one year, it will be the most memorable year because I will be able to give him advice and share my experience with him as he continues our family tradition. Although I am proud, I have to admit that I’ll be living vicariously through him as he participates in all the crazy frosh-week activities, residence antics, meeting new friends, learning about Facebook, having floor parties, downloading from DC++, partying at Stages and having the best time of his life.,I just hope he can push a little room aside for his big sis once in a while.,So, congrats, Joel and all the other frosh.The best experience of your life is in your hands—I hope it’ll be as spectacular as mine has been."},{"title":"There’s your first assignment","url":"/story/2006-09-08/editorials/theres-your-first-assignment/","date":"September 8, 2006","content":"My father worked his first full-time job at the corner of Front and Sherbourne streets in Toronto, but in the 1990s a private realtor bought the land, smashed the office building to the ground and turned the site into a parking lot.,When we last drove by, my brother asked my dad how he felt watching people park their cars near the spot where his career began. My father shrugged and said it was no big deal.,I wonder if I’ll feel the same way about the old Journal House. It was disemboweled last Wednesday to make way for the $230 million Queen’s Centre, and the land beneath it will likely become the annals of a gymnasium change room. For 15 years, groups of 25 under-appreciated and over-worked students recorded the University’s history at 272 Earl St.,If you ever walked up the house’s blue steps, you would know why it was difficult to watch a construction crew smash the place into pieces with the nonchalance of a five-year-old playing with Lego.,Our new house on 190 University Ave. looks slicker than the first Journal House ever did, but that’s probably because it’s still brand new and no one has spilled anything on the couches yet.,The Journal’s online readers deserve to know we are doing everything to get our website updated and working again after it crashed during our move in July.,The Journal’s web archive is one of the only places where you can instantly find out what happened at Queen’s up to five years ago.,We do apologize and we are working to fix the problems.,At our new house, located at 190 University Ave., we will continue to work our hardest to provide you the most accurate account of this year.,We’ve brought back the supplements editor and moved the features section into the news section for more cohesion.

I grew up with Jet Li and Jackie Chan movies, but I never truly started appreciating them until a couple of years ago.,There are regular nerds and buffs, and then there are martial arts nerds and buffs. People like me don’t just watch obscure movies; we study fight choreography in those movies the same way tennis fans study Roger Federer’s game (or Andy Roddick’s, but we won’t get into that). Most people will be satisfied with watching a fight scene and going “Wow, that was cool,” but I will take the same scene, watch it once, then go back and watch it on repeat half a dozen times more.,You might be asking yourself why I’d be so obsessed over something clearly intended to be a spontaneous, vicarious rush for the moviegoer. I would reply with a swift slap to your head, much like how Bruce Lee admonishes his student at the beginning of Enter the Dragon, proclaiming: “Don’t concentrate on the finger, or you will miss all that heavenly glory.” In that scene, Bruce was pointing towards the sky, while the young boy was stupidly gazing at Bruce’s finger.,As fellow English majors can attest, stare at something long enough, and you’ll notice things that weren’t there before—real or imagined. To my eyes, every movement, every shot in a fight scene is a splash of visual poetry. Whether it’s Jackie Chan’s comedic acrobatics or Donnie Yen’s confident, exaggerated strikes, martial arts actors pour their energy and emotion into their movements and express themselves through the interplay between each other. Like dancers and singers, watch a martial artist long enough and you’ll get a glimpse at their actual selves, just from the way they move. That, in fact, was what Bruce Lee touted decades ago: his self-made style, Jeet Kune Do, held self-expression as its utmost ideal.,I am not raising the proverbial glass only to Jet Li’s Fearless, but to him and the generation of Asian martial arts actors he represents. Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung— all of these greats, whether you know them or not, are getting old, and they’re starting to bow out of the industry. I’m slightly uncertain of the future of martial arts films: Who will carry the torch into the next generation? No doubt some of you have heard of Tony Jaa and his Elbows of Doom, but are splits, spinning jumps and other “extreme tricks” the future tradition of these physical poets?,Perhaps I’m thinking too much about this. After all, they’re just martial arts films, right? You know, the chop socky flicks with no plot, cheesy dubbed dialogue and painfully artificial sound effects? You can argue with me on this, but martial arts films today are polished works of art—especially, Fearless, Jet Li’s swan song.,Anyone have a tissue?

The new grey boxes will be used for paper and cardboard, leaving the original blue boxes for bottles and plastic containers.,Other areas of the country have already tested this method but Kingston has only recently adopted the model claiming that it’ll be more efficient, will assist with sorting and will lower costs.,Most students who live off campus have unique living arrangements, where between one and 12 friends may live together under one roof. With each person generating a substantial amount of waste on his or her own, it’s common for bins to be overflowing each week. Because students will have to alternate boxes, they may be deterred from recycling all together.,When recycling bins become full but students are unable to put them on the curb to be removed, they may end up throwing out items that they might have otherwise recycled.,The addition of the grey box for paper and cardboard is welcome; it will limit the hassle of attempting to tie up bundles with pesky string or using plastic bags.,The greater concern is how recycling will only be collected every two weeks. It’s a good idea to separate paper and plastic recycling, but they should still both be collected on a weekly basis.,People should be encouraged to recycle, but with the additional hassle created by the limitations, uncollected recyclables could take up so much space that students may simply give up.,The unfortunate reality is that the more obstacles or restrictions the city places on recycling, the less likely that people will recycle: the harder they make it, the lower the participation will be.,Placing greater restrictions on the amount of garbage a household can have picked up would be a more environmentally friendly option, and even a means of encouraging increased recycling and composting."},{"title":"Hitchcock’s ethics inquiry","url":"/story/2006-09-26/editorials/hitchcocks-ethics-inquiry/","date":"September 26, 2006","content":"In February of 2005, anonymous “state officials” quoted in the New York Times made public the fact that as president of State University of New York (SUNY) Albany, Karen Hitchcock faced an ethics commission inquiry.,The inquiry was launched as a result of allegations that Hitchcock offered to steer an Albany campus construction project to a developer, who would, in exchange, endow the university with a professorship that Hitchcock would fill.,However, when Hitchcock left her post at SUNY Albany to become principal of Queen’s, the inquiry stopped in accordance with a loophole in New York State law—which has since been closed—that prevented anyone from being investigated by an ethics commission once they ceased to be employed by the state.,This past May, despite attempts by Hitchcock herself to re-open the investigation to clear her name, the case was closed, presumably for good.,During this time, the University spent $25,000 to hire high-profile attorney Robert Fiske to conduct an independent investigation on behalf of the school in order to clear Hitchcock’s name.,Understandably, Hitchcock was likely muzzled by her lawyers. Because the University was using student money in an attempt to clear her name, however, students deserved to know more about the situation.,At the very least, it would have been fair for Hitchcock to send a letter to students when the allegations were put to rest, stating what had been discovered and why the investigations are no longer continuing.,By all accounts, it appears as if Hitchcock is completely innocent and has been the target of a rather bizarre and tangled smear campaign. So, if she has nothing to hide, why has she been so quiet? Students deserve an explanation.,Hitchcock has expressed a desire for students to know she is innocent, but she hasn’t followed up on the issues to tell her side of the story. The Journal is willing to provide her with the opportunity: Principal Hitchcock, please consider writing an opinion piece to clear your name and let everyone know where things stand. Students would appreciate any comments you have, and the Journal would be more than happy to provide you with the space."},{"title":"Queen’s shouldn’t pay","url":"/story/2006-09-29/editorials/queens-shouldnt-pay/","date":"September 29, 2006","content":"At this year’s Aberdeen Street party which drew more than eight thousand people, Kingston Police used 200 officers, including 84 OPP officers from the Public Order unit and also a video surveillance unit from Toronto, in order to police the street and ensure the safety of the attendants.,According to the Police Services Board, $352,740 was spent over the course of the weekend. The University has since agreed to meet with the Board to discuss the possibility of contributing to the extra policing costs.,This isn’t the first time this issue has come up. Two years ago, Queen’s voluntarily paid $6,500 to the Board to offset some of their extra policing costs. Last year, however, when the Board sent Queen’s a bill for $84,000, the University refused.,It’s nice to see that this year the University and the Kingston Police are continuing their spirit of cooperation and have at least agreed to sit down to rationally discuss the extra costs incurred by both sides at this year’s Homecoming. That said, the University cannot be held responsible for what happens on Aberdeen Street, and they should not be paying for any of the policing costs. Queen’s set an unfortunate precedent two years ago by their contribution, and would probably take it back now if given the opportunity.,As the University has expressed in the past, it’s ridiculous to assume they control what happens each year on Aberdeen. While Homecoming is a school-sponsored event, the Aberdeen street party is not. The University doesn’t manage the student’s activities off-campus, and the number of non-Queen’s students who attend the party is entirely out of the University’s hands. People come from all over the country to party at Homecoming and it isn’t possible to stop them, regardless of the attempts made.,VP (Academic) Patrick Deane is correct to say that neither the AMS, the University, nor the city can control who attends the Aberdeen street party, and so the University shouldn’t be held financially accountable. To use Deane’s words further: “It would be a healthy thing for the city of Kingston to realize it has custody of a problem event.”"},{"title":"Citizens take to the streets","url":"/story/2006-09-08/editorials/citizens-take-streets/","date":"September 8, 2006","content":"Pop quiz hot shot: It’s Homecoming, you’re drunk on Aberdeen Street, smashing bottles and flipping cars as a lovely old man in a bright green cap wanders over and kindly asks you to stop. What do you do?,This year, students partying on Aberdeen will be joined by hundreds of alumni and other volunteer citizens on the well-known street, who will attempt to act as a buffer between police and students. They plan to ask students to trade in bottles for plastic cups, and encourage safe and respectful behaviour. Unfortunately, these well-intentioned volunteers may prove to be a target for undesirable behaviour, especially for the most dangerous troublemakers and out-of-towners with no long-term investment in the school community.,The creation of the “Aberdeen Street Community Volunteers” points to the failing of city council to come up with any effective ideas, particularly their avoidance of harm reduction strategies. When students presented the idea of exchanging bottles, city council stated that it would be like condoning illegal activity. It took one individual from the community, Vinni Rebelo, who decided to take proactive measures to bypass city council and create a more effective solution than any of the recommendations made by the Committee for the Safe and Legal Use of Public and Private Space (a committee that was established to find solutions to the Aberdeen problem).,While the initiative is admirable, it seems that the biggest troublemakers will not take these people seriously. In an attempt to diffuse anxiety between students and police, the alumni may end up taking the brunt of the aggression (whether verbal or physical) because they lack the recognizable authority of officers. At least this year the student vs. police mentality will be offset by sober third party observers that can objectively monitor behaviour from both sides.,Without notifying students ahead of time, hundreds of citizens attempting to prevent violence may become a huge joke and, unlike police, members of this group will have limited methods to defend themselves.,Ultimately, it’s up to students to realize for themselves and notify others of what is unacceptable behaviour. We can only hope that the good-natured citizens, who have no intention of stopping the party but only want to keep it safe and fun for everyone, will not be met with the same hostility as police in previous years."},{"title":"Facebook’s not the problem","url":"/story/2006-10-03/editorials/facebooks-not-problem/","date":"October 3, 2006","content":"Why is it that students are beginning to feel the need to publicly announce everything that happens to them every moment of every day? Perhaps more alarming, are the bizarre and naïve notions of students regarding their online security and privacy while using programs such as Facebook and LiveJournal.,Facebook began as an exclusive site for college and university students to meet one another and make inter-campus connections. But it quickly expanded to include high-school students, and is now open to anyone with access to a computer.,Somewhere along the way, students forgot that the information they are posting on this rapidly growing site is available to and accessible by everyone. Information and pictures posted are archived and readily available. According to the sites’ own Privacy Policy, information can be legally obtained by\nthird parties in certain circumstances. An increasing number of potential employers, professors and “potentially” police are signing up for public accounts. When voluntarily submitting information, students also agree that people on their friends list, or anyone who is computer-savvy enough to type in the correct web address, can also view their information. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of Facebook is that people can post pictures and information about others without their consent, or even their knowledge. There may be a sense of anonymity in the masses, but this is a false sense of ecurity that students need to become aware of in order to protect their privacy. Often, students put up information intended for a select group, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that people from outside that group won’t be able to view it. As Dave Patterson, Campus Security director said, “It’s a public forum and people should kind of treat it as such.”,Oh, and in the future, Vice-Principal (Advancement) George Hood might want to consider protecting his e-mail and password from his children who are, according to Hood, responsible for his account.,According to the ITS Code of Ethics, he is in violation of section three which clearly states, “Users shouldn’t divulge passwords and other access control information for their personal accounts to any other person.” Or perhaps he simply lied to the Journal, and actually created an account, in which case he should own up to that as well."},{"title":"The guilt-trip campaign","url":"/story/2006-09-12/editorials/guilt-trip-campaign/","date":"September 12, 2006","content":"Last week, Queen’s unveiled a new advertising campaign aimed at preventing—or at least limiting—the potential for a repeat of last year’s Homecoming fiasco. The ads focus on the damage done to the Queen’s reputation by the events of last year.,The ads guilt trip students into considering the long-term consequences of their own actions, but also the actions of their peers. You can view all five ads for yourself: queensu.ca/safeHomecomingCampaign/.,Hopefully the ads will encourage students to, in some ways, police ourselves. These advertisements are effective at making students stop and question whether they’re willing to assist in jeopardizing the reputation of their school and the value of their degree. Reputation is a large factor in why many students come to Queen’s, so it makes sense to target that aspect of Queen’s culture to influence students.,One thing’s for sure: this campaign is far better than previous attempts by both the administration and the AMS to thwart excessive partying and unruly behaviour during Homecoming. Where previous ads were condescending, motherly, and preaching from a moral high ground, these ads appeal to the larger student population, who may not be setting cars on fire and smashing bottles, but are equally affected by the University’s damaged reputation.,It’s clear the administration is concerned with losing alumni donations, which have decreased since last year’s Homecoming incident, but losing alumni donations is something all students should be concerned with as it’s a considerable funding source for the University.,Unfortunately, one of the ads is in somewhat poor taste. It states that nobody died at Homecoming but 18,063 people (the entire student population) were hurt. Because there were students who were physically injured last year on Aberdeen, this particular advertisement seemed a bit tactless and unnecessary.,Aside from the sensationalized poster, the campaign is creative, thought-provoking and effective. The ads have no intention of telling students not to party, but urges them to consider the consequences of their actions.,Although the campaign may not completely prevent havoc at Homecoming, these posters will hopefully influence some students to reconsider the number of friends they invite for the weekend and the kinds of activities in which they participate in. It’s disappointing the ads didn’t attempt to raise excitement about the numerous positive possibilities of Homecoming rather than focus on preventing a repeat of last year."},{"title":"Last chance for student-run discipline","url":"/story/2006-05-30/editorials/last-chance-student-run-discipline/","date":"May 30, 2006","content":"With only a week’s notice given to the AMS and the rest of the student body, the university’s seven deans collectively created a motion to be presented at Senate to remove the 108-year-old system of non-academic discipline from the jurisdiction of students, and into the hands of the “Principal of Queen’s University and/or his delegate.” Although Arts and Science Dean Robert Silverman said that the timing of the motion was not calculated, it was thoughtless and showed poor judgment. A decision of this magnitude deserves a thorough examination and debate when the majority of students can be involved in the process. Even the AMS executive was only given one week’s notice.,The motion was vague, only calling to revoke non-academic discipline from students, without indicating any alternative system that would replace it, other than to consolidate all power in the principal’s office.,The events of Homecoming and of the more recent incident on Aberdeen don’t make up the majority of cases presented at the AMS Judicial Committee (JComm). Incoming chief prosecutor, Jennifer Mansell told Senate that only about 25 per cent of cases passing through JComm were Homecoming-related.,Appropriately, the motion was tabled until November.,As the Kelsea Fitzpatrick case highlights, the student-run system needs work. Fitzpatrick’s tri-pub ban was overturned by the highest appeal board and the AMS was heavily criticized in its handling of the case.,The editorial printed in the May 26 Kingston Whig-Standard, lamenting the tabling of the motion, was—like the deans’ motion—an emotional, irrational and hasty reaction to a much more complicated problem.,The main crux of the deans’ motion and the Whig’s editorial seemed aimed at solely tackling Homecoming. However, JComm operates year-round and handles a variety of cases. As Mansell mentioned in her address, before passing any such motion, Senate should first allow the recommendations made by the Senate Committee on Non-Academic Discipline and the AMS to be implemented. JComm and the peer-administered non-academic discipline system will be closely observed from now until November. The events that transpire at Homecoming 2006 will likely decide the fate of student-run non-academic discipline at Queen’s."},{"title":"Golden Cockroach award a good first step","url":"/story/2006-03-10/editorials/golden-cockroach-award-good-first-step/","date":"March 10, 2006","content":"The first AMS Golden Cockroach was awarded to Phil Lam for being the worst Ghetto landlord based on nominations filed by current tenants. At the ceremony on Feb. 9, Lam’s student rental house on 288 Earl St. was highlighted as an example of the poor condition of Lam’s properties.,Lam subsequently sent a letter in response to this award, calling it slanderous. In his letter he wrote that “a student government, who prides itself on presumably being fair, should be ashamed of the actions it took against myself. It takes little courage to cast aspersions against a person based on anonymous complaints.” The complaints were not anonymous, but Lam says he is considering legal action. It must also be noted that in addition to recognizing bad landlords, the AMS also awarded Keystone Property Management with the key to the Ghetto for providing good housing to students.,Lam made the argument that “if the house was of such poor quality one, of course, has to ask why [renters] continue to live there.” This points to a long-held misconception by students that there is a housing shortage in the Ghetto, which, in fact, is not true. Students often feel they need to accept poor conditions for lack of choice, but this should not be the case. Students have a responsibility to thoroughly look into the conditions of houses before signing a lease and file complaints when problems arise. The poor condition of many properties in the Ghetto underlines the need for better enforcement of the city’s property standards by students, the AMS and the city. As well, the properties on the Queen’s Apartment and Housing Service website should not be listed based on the property but by landlord: just because some properties owned by one landlord may meet property standards does not mean that all of the landlord’s houses meet them. If some of a landlord’s homes are listed as approved on the website, students might wrongly infer that all of their properties are well-maintained.,The most important thing is that students stay as informed as possible about their rights as tenants and file complaints to ensure accountability on the part of landlords."},{"title":"Harper: puppet master extraordinaire","url":"/story/2006-03-31/editorials/harper-puppet-master-extraordinaire/","date":"March 31, 2006","content":"It all began on Monday when Stephen Harper refused to allow the media to be present when children from the Canadian Cancer Society gave him daffodils in his office. Then on Tuesday, Harper held his first unannounced cabinet meeting.,These changes are indicative of the controlling tactics Harper has begun to employ with the media. The Canadian Press reports that Harper will soon be denying photographers access to closed meetings between officials, opting to release in-house photos instead. He also plans on creating a list of media wishing to ask questions, from which he will choose reporters who will be permitted to ask questions, effectively deciding the issues he would like to discuss.,Media unions have decried these moves by Harper as a threat to Canadian democracy and rightly so. After running on a campaign of transparency in government, he is drawing the blinds altogether. Journalists will soon be forced to wait a floor below the cabinet room where meetings are being conducted and will have to literally chase after ministers to answer questions. Ministers are not Hollywood celebrities and journalists are not the paparazzi. The purpose of the media is to hold governments accountable. What Harper is doing is essentially evading that accountability, which does not bode well for his term as prime minister.,Harper is not only controlling his own exposure to the media but also that of his cabinet ministers. In order to control the Conservative message, ministers must be permitted—by him—to speak to the media.,“As representatives of Canadian journalists, we are alarmed at this tactic. It smacks of totalitarianism, not the democratic process we are used to in this country,” Peter Murdoch from the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers union told the Canadian Press.,Stephen Harper’s disdain for the media has never been a secret, but his drastic measures against the press are reminiscent of the manipulative tactics of his counterpart south of the border. Harper is limiting the freedom of the press and censoring information to the Canadian public.,The Canadian Press reports that Harper’s director of communications, Sandra Buckler has said: “I don’t think the average Canadian cares as long as they know their government is being well run.” First of all, in the short time since he has been elected, Harper’s governance has already raised questions about his governance. Secondly, this assumption is baseless and paints Canadians as ignorant and uninformed. Canadians care about the details of how their tax dollars are being spent and how the nation is being governed. Similarly, cabinet ministers should not simply allow Harper to rule with an iron fist.,The media is not meant to be a government newsletter, and if Stephen Harper cannot handle the heat, he should get out of the kitchen."},{"title":"Abu Ghraib is just the beginning","url":"/story/2006-03-24/editorials/abu-ghraib-just-beginning/","date":"March 24, 2006","content":"It has recently come to light that the abuses committed by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison were not the first instances of violence against detainees in Iraq. There is now evidence of the existence of Task Force 6-26, a special unit with secret headquarters at Baghdad International Airport called Camp Nama. According to The New York Times, soldiers used one of the torture chambers that were once used by the former Iraqi government as an interrogation room, calling it the Black Room.,“In the windowless, jet-black garage-size room, some soldiers beat prisoners with rifle butts, yelled and spit in their faces and, in a nearby area, used detainees for target practice in a game of jailer paintball.” U.S. officials have consistently maintained the torture that took place at Abu Ghraib prison was isolated and the due to the actions of a select group of individuals. However, as more and more information surfaces regarding the Black Room and Task Force 6-26, or any other manifestations of this task force, it is becoming evident that the U.S. government was not only aware of the torture that was taking place at Abu Ghraib, but more than likely encouraged it.,Above the special area for Task Force 6-26, soldiers allegedly put up a sign that read, “NO BLOOD, NO FOUL.” According to the Times article, “the slogan, as one Defense Department official explained, reflected an adage adopted by Task Force 6-26: ‘If you don’t make them bleed, they can’t prosecute for it.’” Yet again, this is a perfect example of the Bush administration creating its own rules, rather than obeying any sort of universal conventions. Like those at Guantánamo Bay, detainees are denied their rights, and the actions of the soldiers defy the Geneva Conventions.,It is not acceptable for the Bush administration to defend such atrocious actions with a blanket statement about the “terror” they are fighting; it simply isn’t enough. Behind all the rhetoric, all the verbal acrobatics and the work of spin doctors, the U.S. government has chosen to perpetuate the violence that it claims to be acting against, while at the same time failing to remain accountable to the very people it is defending: the American people.,Although some individuals involved with the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison have been charged and disciplined, the saga is far from over. As evidence of the existence of Task Force 6-26 as well as the Extraordinary Rendition program comes to light, it seems inevitable that more will be unearthed about the violations made by the U.S. government against Iraqis during the past three years of war.,However, the Bush administration has yet to realize that it is not above the law and that there are procedures for interrogation in place that must be followed."},{"title":"Dependable dependents","url":"/story/2006-03-17/editorials/dependable-dependents/","date":"March 17, 2006","content":"With tears running down her face, the older woman shook hands and hugged the doctor standing in the open doorway leading into the waiting room. This was a tragic and true scene in which the doctor had probably participated many times. I saw this happen while leaning against the empty reception desk and, for a brief moment, I forgot where I was. I could only wonder what had just happened to the unfortunate woman.,I imagine a scene like this happens quite often in a hospital or a doctor’s office: a person suffers a terrible loss and simply cannot contain their sorrow. I did not, however, expect to see it in this particular doctor’s office. This event happened two days ago at the veterinary clinic where I had taken my cat, Clementine, to get neutered. The last time I had owned any pet was when I was 12 years old. It was a dog that had a rather vicious temper and some companionship issues. She certainly didn’t like the company of strangers, and sometimes she didn’t like the company of her family. Nonetheless, she was the family’s dog and was loved appropriately. When we were forced to give our dog away, I imagine my family felt a lot like that woman in the clinic, but I suppose I can’t really speak for anyone else but myself. I bring it up, though, because when I had a dog as a child, I never remembered feeling like the dog was dependent on me—dependent on my family, maybe—but not me personally. Whatever may have happened to that woman, she seemed like she lost someone that was truly near to her heart, truly dependent on her for its livelihood. As university students, we have the luxury of being independent and, for the most part, away from our families. We rely on our own ability to feed and support ourselves without the worry of doing it for anyone else. The loss of a dependent, at least for me, seemed like a far-off, unimaginable tragedy that might happen on a blue moon during a leap-year in another place. At least until I saw that woman. Maybe it’s because after my dog left I never felt the joy of owning a pet, one that relied on me and wanted my attention. I never considered the bond that might form between myself and them and never considered that the bond, for whatever reason, could be broken. Maybe that is why the scene in the veterinary clinic struck such a chord in my heart that I had never felt. Moments after the woman and the doctor had hugged, tears still flowing, the receptionist, who had gone to the back room to retrieve Clementine, returned with something for me: my now neutered, very delirious, sore and beautiful black and white cat. He was still a little wobbly on his back legs, for obvious reasons, and it made me laugh a little. It was at that moment that I realized how lucky I was to have a dependent, even if it’s just a lazy cat. And I suggest the following to any student wanting to fill a spot in their heart: get a dependable cat."},{"title":"South Dakota sets an alarming precedent","url":"/story/2006-03-17/editorials/south-dakota-sets-alarming-precedent/","date":"March 17, 2006","content":"Earlier this month, the Governor of South Dakota, Mike Rounds, signed a new law that would essentially ban all abortions in the state unless the mother’s life was is in danger. Even in cases of rape and incest, the mother’s life would have to be at serious risk before an abortion could be performed.,In a 2004 poll conducted by South Dakota paper Argus Leader, only 25 per cent of South Dakotans were in favour of such strict limitations on abortion. In spite of this, Governor Rounds has taken it upon himself to implement a law effectively denying women any control over their own bodies.,This law is isolated to the state of South Dakota, but its implications are disturbing. If it is allowed to pass without opposition, it would set a precedent and could open the door for other states to adopt the same legal stance. This law is unjust.,State Senator Bill Napoli’s grossly insensitive and fetishized rhetoric on the matter is also deeply disturbing. According to Napoli, a woman’s life might be considered to be in danger due to psychological distress after a rape if “the girl was a virgin. She was religious. She planned on saving her virginity until she was married. She was brutalized and raped, sodomized as bad as you can possibly make it, and is impregnated.” Does this mean the psychological distress of a female rape victim who was not a virgin, not religious or not sodomized would be insufficient to grant her a choice?,There is also a difference between “pro-choice” and “pro-abortion.” Pro-choice activists are not expressing enthusiasm for abortion, but rather are in support of the right to choose. Rather than denying women the right to choose, abortion opponents should push for more social resources that would make it easier for women to choose options other than abortion."},{"title":"Re: my addiction to e-mail","url":"/story/2006-03-24/editorials/re-my-addiction-e-mail/","date":"March 24, 2006","content":"Hi, my name is James, and I’m an e-mail-a-holic (all: “Hiiii James”). That’s right, I have a problem, and it’s not a habit I’m likely to kick any time soon.,I started thinking about this recently when replies to my grad school applications started coming in. Not surprisingly, Oxford turned me down in a polite and encouraging letter. McGill did the same, but in a few short lines, and by e-mail. E-mail!,To me, that seemed exceptionally cheap and borderline offensive, and I began to wonder why. Virtually all of my written correspondence is via electronic messages, and I can’t ignore the fact I find it impossible to imagine doing my current job at the Journal without it.,I suppose it’s a necessary evil. I now have five e-mail accounts that I check regularly. And when I say regularly, what I really mean to say is obsessively.,I have a professor who warned us at the beginning of the term that she only checks her e-mail once a day. She’d decided to cut herself off. And while I admire that kind of self-restraint, her addiction obviously had nothing on mine.,I laughed when the verdict in the trial involving RIM, makers of the popular Blackberry, loomed in the news. The sneering derision of columnists about the anxieties of so-called “Crackberry addicts” amused me. But I’m no better. If you want to follow their seedy metaphor to its conclusion, I’m the kind of guy who has a kilo of QLink and a box of Gmail syringes nearby at all times.,My parents stubbornly refused to familiarize themselves with either e-mail or computers for an impressively long time, but they both eventually caved. And like that shady friend, I was happy to show them the way, to give them their first taste and leave them at its mercy.,The annoying part of the habit is that most of the mail I get is disappointing. No, I don’t need cheap Viagra. No, my non-existent bank account at the bank I don’t use has not suffered a security breach, so you can’t have my password. And no, I will not be able to retain my sanity if I’m forced to have another meeting with the intramural office about my hockey team’s latest alleged improprieties.,Yet still, I’m back at the keyboard, hammering in my password. It’s a great credit to IBM that the six keys needed to enter it on my laptop still work.,Perhaps venerable McGill has opened my eyes. As my last few weeks at Queen’s wind down, perhaps I will symbolically Kill McGill one last time by writing a letter—by hand—to the only people I can think of who haven’t been infected by this electronic plague-cum-miracle: my grandparents.,It will probably only be a quick fix, though, a morale-booster much like a quickly ignored new year’s resolution. If you pay close attention to a particular episode of Family Guy, you’ll find in the background a liquor store called “The Thirteenth Step.” I fear that, as far as I’m able to take my rehab, I already know what my thirteenth step will be: Facebook."},{"title":"Those photo shoots!

I’m a smart girl. I can see right through Tyra Banks’ fake smile and seemingly perfect ways. I understand the use of that awful electro-beat soundtrack to keep us glued to the screen. And those models—who doesn’t think they’re completely vapid and, for the most part, emaciated?,But those photo shoots! The incessant drama! And that delightful J. Alexander!,My obsession started with a simple mention of the show. Outwardly, I exhibited disgust for a show that praised such narrow views of beauty.,Inwardly, however, I became fascinated, secretly streaming episodes on youtube.com almost every night.,You can find entire episodes online, and I wasted a lot of time watching as many as I could find. Maybe it was the quick-cutting, or perhaps it was the bass-heavy soundtrack, but I was hooked and helpless to pry myself away, even though it went against everything I stood for.,These girls were trained to fit the fashion industry’s pedigree, which is completely unrealistic, and somewhat degrading for women. The idea that a model has to exude perfect looks, perfect etiquette, and be ready for any sort of mishap is absurd. I was a closet ANTM fan, but I couldn’t understand why.,An assessment of the show would reveal that there’s nothing phenomenal about it.,ANTM’s basic premise has been used hundreds of times before on other so-called reality shows. With such amounts of mindless television, it seems that U.S. television networks are starved for ideas, and will transform just about any crazy notion into a new concept for the next reality show.,In the wake of The Apprentice, and The Surreal Life should the existence of ANTM come as a surprise? For goodness sake, Regis Philbin is hosting a talent show with David Hasselhoff as a judge. Reality TV is practically a parody of itself.,The drama on ANTM shouldn’t come as a surprise, either.,Take a handful of self-obsessed people, tell them that they (somehow) have to improve and the result is bound to be entertaining.,It’s so entertaining, in fact, that Canada has recently joined the bandwagon with its own version, aptly titled Canada’s Next Top Model.,It’s basically the same show, but with a different model playing host (Tricia Helfer), and instead of a loft in New York City, the girls reside in a fancy waterside cottage in British Columbia. In both versions, contestants have so much passion for their appearance and for winning that they often come off as bombastic.,They’re so concentrated on getting that modeling contract that “only one” can win (as Tyra Banks has repeated on every broadcast) that they’ve lost sight of the fact that they’re just entertainment fodder for the rest of us.,It’s great TV to be sure, but it’s a guilty pleasure. Although it’s sad to see these women erode our ideas of beauty as they parade around the catwalk, I don’t think we’re meant to take it seriously."},{"title":"Subway snubs & elevator evasions","url":"/story/2006-05-30/editorials/subway-snubs-and-elevator-evasions/","date":"May 30, 2006","content":"Growing up in the large and metropolitan—at least by Canadian standards—city of Calgary, I thought I was an expert when it came to the rules of urban politics. You know, when to hold the door for someone, when to say “hello” to a stranger and when to pretend to be absorbed in the fascinating world of your own arm hair, and all those other vague notions of “good citizenship” and “civility.,Then I moved to Toronto for a summer of subway commutes and apartment elevator rides, and found my innocent, naïve notion of urban camaraderie stripped away.,Its replacement? A steely-eyed gaze, a firm shoulder for sidewalk shoving and a strange sense of loneliness, even in the busiest city settings.,It all started last week, as I braved the sea of commuters on my daily subway adventure to work. With the car filled, I glimpsed one remaining seat, next to a woman about my age. Gleeful at my luck, I sat down next to her and pulled out my daily crossword puzzle. A few stops into my ride, my new subway companion stood up, walked to a freshly vacated seat, and plopped herself down. Startled, my first thought was to smell myself (because there’s nothing like two years as an undergrad to get you into a sub-par hygienic routine). Nope, fresh as a daisy.,I next looked at her now empty seat and the floor around it: clean, no piles of festering trash to compel this woman to swap spots. After an in-depth study of the subway car and its contents, I came to the shocking conclusion that she had moved simply because, for the rest of her ten minute subway ride, she wanted to sit entirely by herself, safe from any risk that my small, silent, crossword-enthralled self might interfere with her inner thoughts and appraisal of wall advertisements for Lactaids.,At this point, you might be asking me why the hell I care about one woman and her personal space issues. But the incident of the subway seat-switcher is merely one example of a far-reaching urban epidemic that I’ve become all too aware of as a newly minted Torontonian. People in Toronto really don’t like other people, and they want those other people to know it. I don’t know if this is true in most urban centers, but whether it’s avoiding physical proximity on subways, abstaining from eye contact even at the cost of walking into a post on a quasi-regular basis or pretending that the ceiling of the elevator is covered in artwork so awe-inspiring that one simply cannot force themselves to look away, it is my experience that city dwellers seem obsessed with maintaining an obsessively strict veil of anonymity and a sharply delineated region of personal space.,I can’t quite pinpoint the reason for the profound unfriendliness I’ve found to permeate my new city, but I have a few ideas. Maybe, in our culture of fast-paced schedules and superficial escapism, people are too caught up in their own lives and the lives of the doctors on Grey’s Anatomy to say “hi” on the elevator. Maybe living in a big city breeds a paranoia that if I touch you on the subway, it’s either because I’m injecting you with heroin or trying to cop a feel. Or finally, maybe I’m just too sensitive for my own good, finding unfriendliness where there is only unintentional neutrality. But be warned, citizens of Toronto and the rest of the urban world: if the seat beside you is empty, brace yourself, because you’d better believe I’m going to take it. And close your eyes, because I might even throw in a smile while I’m at it."},{"title":"Clowning around","url":"/story/2006-03-10/editorials/clowning-around/","date":"March 10, 2006","content":"I hate clowns. I hate the way they look, I hate the way they dress, I hate the way they act. And I hate myself even more for saying it. But I guess if we’re being honest, the real reason I despise clowns is because they terrify me. No joke. And, unfortunately, it is not just clowns. Those large furry mascots at sporting events and almost anyone wearing a costume in a non-Halloween, non-theme party context I find downright frightening. In the past, it was not uncommon for me to cross the street upon spotting a clown. I’ve declined invitations to telltale events like the circus and carnivals. And visiting Disney World with my family became a week-long challenge of avoiding life-size incarnations of Mickey and Minnie. Needless to say, my autograph book came home with its pages empty, and that’s how I wanted it.,My life without clowns suited me fine.,That is, until one brief moment two weeks ago in a rowdy bar in Mexico.,I had been standing inside a crowd of people, and when the sweaty pushiness of the group became too unbearable, I weaved my way through them until I was huddled on the outskirts and able to breathe.,It was then that I noticed him—a clown—also working his way through the crowd.,My heart sank and my first inclination was to scowl. I wasn’t expecting my lifelong phobia to find me in Cancun. I hadn’t spent money to see clowns.,I sized him up. He was wearing a stupid orange jumpsuit and had hot pink face paint. I hated him almost immediately. But upon a closer inspection, I noticed that he was also scowling. In fact, he was one unhappy clown. He would only smile when someone would pull him into a picture. The thing was, without the typical clown-y smirk, he seemed so human. He wasn’t a clown; he was an unhappy man in a clown suit.,With my sympathies towards someone trying to make an honest living overriding any past fears I had about his profession, I made my way over to him. Our interaction was short. I asked for a balloon hat, and he made it. I tipped him, and he smiled. This made me happy, because the last thing I wanted was a clown with a bone of contention towards me.,And it was no big deal. The experience made me re-evaluate my fears, and I decided that all my pent-up anger towards clowns was because I was actually jealous of them.,As a child, I was painfully shy and awkward. In elementary school, I would often have to eat my lunches at home because the thought of chatting with my peers was enough to make me physically ill. My parents, concerned that I going to live a reclusive life riddled with ulcers, enrolled me in a drama program at our local community centre. It took longer then they had hoped, but eventually I came out of my shell. However, to this day, I have never been able to act as carefree and approachable as clowns do. I don’t know if it’s the face paint or frills that give clowns their confidence, but I wish I knew their secret. I’ve reason to believe that it’s because they don’t care what people think of them.,Now, I still know that I will never be able to watch Stephen King’s It, and I am not jumping into a mascot suit anytime soon, but I can respect someone who isn’t afraid to clown around once in a while."},{"title":"Good journalism comes at a price","url":"/story/2006-04-06/editorials/good-journalism-comes-price/","date":"April 6, 2006","content":"It’s not often a student lectures a cop and gets away with it.

Tear gas, shields, batons, pepper spray …,Me: [Starts scribbling furiously on notepad],Policeman 1: We’re good and ready for any hostile situation.,Policeman 2: [Saunters over] Would you get any taller if we pulled your leg?,Recognizing a need for damage control, Policeman 2 assured me the van was simply a coffee station for the 100-plus cops in the Ghetto that night.,Me: [loud, incredulous] It doesn’t matter if I’m a student or a journalist! Don’t you recognize that lying to me only serves to do exactly what your police commander told me he was trying to avoid: the creation a ‘students versus police’ mentality?,The exchange didn’t make it to print in the following Tuesday’s Journal. It wasn’t that I neglected to include the anecdote. I purposely left it out.,As a student who experienced Aberdeen first hand, I undoubtedly held strong opinions about the vulgar escalation of violence that occurred that night. But as a journalist, it was my duty to keep personal bias out of the story—to avoid editorializing on a situation that drew fire, both literally and figuratively.,During my past three years working for the Journal, finishing my stint as 2005-06 news editor with this signed editorial, I strived to keep my text clean, provide multiple perspectives on the issues and above all, serve students by pursuing a fair story.,Just last weekend, I found myself uttering similar sentiments to an outgoing student leader (whom I deeply respect) about why I would be reporting on a topic that was sensitive to her: “It’s not my job to judge, it’s my job to report the facts.”,This isn’t an unusual circumstance for a journalist to encounter. In January, when I interviewed Rex Smith, editor of the Albany Times Union—the newspaper that cracked open the ethics inquiry into Principal Hitchcock—I learned he’d felt discomfort having to report on someone he considers “visionary.” His words give me strength.,“I’ve never become accustomed to the way journalism sometimes requires its practitioners to abandon friendship and personal belief in the pursuit of a fair story. The two great tenets of the craft are, first, to seek the truth and report it fully, and, second, to act independently. That latter point makes it hard sometimes to keep friends.”,With every touchy subject I’ve reported on, I’ve walked (and often dreamed about) the fine line between being sensitive and hard-hitting. And although at times I’ve faced gut-wrenching episodes of questioning, I’ve been privileged to be supported by fellow Journal editors and writers the entire way.,Journalism is about telling truth to power, so I’ve heard, and it’s about being bold and being brave. But sometimes, as the wisest woman ever to grace the Journal recently told me, it’s about following your gut.,So I leave you with these words, that I won’t claim as my own: Speak up for what you believe.

The essays have accumulated faster than snow on a Ghetto sidewalk, I’ve crammed too much into each day, and I’ve taken on things I didn’t really want to do.,I’ve tried escapism. I ditched life for a week at the end of October and dashed off to Cuba with my mom for some much-needed R&R. But I was so stressed about all the things I wasn’t doing and all the work piling up that I couldn’t completely relax. Not that I’d take it back—it saved me from a nervous breakdown.,I’ve also tried the “just get through this year and the next will be better” mind game. Hell, lots of students say that at this time of year. But the thing is, next year generally isn’t better because we never learn from the mistakes we’ve made. Instead of demanding happiness and enjoying life, we settle all over again and we become even more miserable.,That I’ve switched my concentration each of my four years at Queen’s—and I’m gearing up to switch it again as I head into my fifth year—is a clear indication I’m dissatisfied with the cookie-cutter degree Queen’s offers. Still, there are things I love about being here, and they offset the bad. Queen’s and I have a great love-hate relationship going and there are few places I’d rather be right now.,As I searched my soul for answers to the restlessness and anxiety I’ve been feeling, I discovered it wasn’t particularly what I was doing that was so frustrating; it was what I wasn’t doing. I discovered I haven’t really been living at all. And I want to live, I want to wake up. I want to go back to living my life according to the things that truly make me happy.,So I’ve started having coffee with friends I’d lost touch with.

And movies—I have so many movies to watch.,There are meals to cook as I dance around the kitchen to blaring music. I have long meandering walks to take, window shopping to do and food to share with friends at our favourite restaurants.

According to the Toronto Star, the union wants to “improve the quality of education by reducing class sizes through the hiring of more full-time teachers to lower the student-instructor ratio. It also wants class sizes, now averaging about 28, trimmed to 25, and the percentage of part-timers cut from its current level of about one-third to 20 per cent over the life of the new contract.” The strike comes at a very inopportune time of the academic year. Students are so close to finishing and yet may eventually be forced to forfeit the term. Regardless, students should be compensated for the class time already lost. Many will face housing issues given that many leases will end in May while courses may not. They may also lose part of their summers usually spent working to earn tuition dollars. Additionally, there is the issue of graduation for those close to the end of their college programs. It is hardly fair for students to be used as pawns while the two sides remain suspended in indecision and far from negotiations.,It seems as though both sides have spent too much time arguing and too little time actually at the bargaining table. It is about time both sides sat down and reached a deal in the interests of students, particularly since few students have voiced support for the strikers’ demands. For many students, with May looming large, a deal can’t come quickly enough, even if it requires the involvement of a third-party mediator."},{"title":"The Greenroom-Tricolour switch","url":"/story/2006-06-27/editorials/greenroom-tricolour-switch/","date":"June 27, 2006","content":"Consider this hypothetical situation: Store A is in one location and is having difficulty consistently attracting customers, incurring losses of $60,000.

Switch places.,Now replace Store A with the Greenroom and Store B with the Tricolour Market, spend $20,000 of students’ money making the switch and unfortunately this hypothetical situation is a reality.,According to the Board of Directors at their May 27 meeting, moving the Greenroom downstairs in the JDUC beside the post office was the ideal solution. They believe the Greenroom won’t have problems in the lower traffic area because they sell used books, and students will visit the store no matter where it is.,Well, that logic works for the first two weeks of a term, but after that, the Greenroom will have the exact same problem attracting customers.,It also seems strange that this $20,000 move is happening only a year after the Greenroom and Tricolour Market were created, and at a time when the JDUC nears demolition.,So, if all of this just isn’t adding up, then congratulations. You caught on to the ulterior motive: The Queen’s Centre.,The construction of the $230 million project will begin this year. And, in a simplified sense, having real estate space in the JDUC guarantees real estate space in the Queen’s Centre.,The AMS is willing to incur steady and considerable losses in both these services—at students’ expense—as a means to an end in the Queen’s Centre.,The AMS bought the College Book Merchant two years ago when Sandra and Doug Sutcliffe were running it and losing money. They turned it into the Tricolour Market, offering a similar product line, in order to secure retail space in the Queen’s Centre.,The Greenroom-Tricolour switch may have more to do with opening up the JDUC leases with the hope that the AMS will gain more flexibility in the products they will be able to sell—like food—in the long term.,All of this time and money could be used to help the services develop a more concrete identity and begin to provide a service that actually fills a student need."},{"title":"Grants, dialogue must accompany fee hike","url":"/story/2006-03-17/editorials/grants-dialogue-must-accompany-fee-hike/","date":"March 17, 2006","content":"Just last week the province announced its new plans for post-secondary tuition. Chris Bentley, the minister of training, colleges and universities, explained that the tuition increases will vary. For example, the increase for a first-year Arts and Science student will be capped at 4.5 per cent, while the increase for an upper-year student will be capped at four per cent. First-year students in professional programs, however, could see tuition increases of up to eight per cent.,Alarming to many is the fact that there was no assurance that OSAP assistance would increase in proportion to tuition increases. Although the government has already invested in other student financial assistance, we have yet to see how this assistance will be distributed.,Perhaps this is what concerns students the most: we have been left in the dark as to what the McGuinty government intends to do to address the inevitable need for assistance that will accompany the increase in tuition. Increasing funding to OSAP is one solution, but what might be more beneficial to students is the establishment of a more extensive grants system to avoid ratcheting up student debt levels. Many students and their families are able to cover the higher costs, but the province must provide real assistance to those who cannot.,While a tuition increase is unfortunate, it is in some ways necessary. If we look around campus at the state of many of our facilities and our student-professor ratios, we can immediately see areas that desperately need to be improved. If increasing tuition will quickly and measurably improve the quality of our education, it is a sacrifice we as students may need to make, even as we ask the province to reduce tuition fees over the long term. It is easy to complain about the decrepitude of buildings, but as adults, we are also capable of assuming some financial responsibility for our education. Both we and the province have a role to play.,That isn’t to say that we should allow tuition to increase without limits. The creation of the Higher Education Quality Council, for example, is a good step in ensuring that institutions are held accountable for actually using the extra funds to improve accessibility and the quality of education. Universities should set realistic goals and standards and charge only the tuition necessary to ensure they are met, rather than increasing tuition as high as the market will bear.,While the demonstration by Queen’s students on Monday showed the province and the administration that students are concerned about the changes to tuition regulation, demonstrators at Chris Bentley’s initial announcement, as well as some local protesters, were not opposing the framework in an effective manner. In order to garner the respect and attention of politicians and administrators alike, students must articulate their concerns clearly and in detail, without resorting to aggressive tactics and rhetoric. After all, student voices need to be heard, now more than ever."},{"title":"Campus safety ... one year later","url":"/story/2006-03-31/editorials/campus-safety-one-year-later/","date":"March 31, 2006","content":"A year after the tragic death of Justin Schwieg, student safety is as much an issue as ever, not only off campus but also on campus. The hands-off policy followed by security at campus bars is of particular concern. The hands-off policy adhered to by the Queen’s Student Constables and Campus Security makes it difficult for them to defuse violent situations.,As it stands now, StuCons are only permitted to verbally discourage individuals from violent or disruptive behaviour, a strategy that has proven to be ineffective with drunken patrons. It is, however, understandable that StuCons are limited in their ability to physically intervene in violent altercations because of legal ramifications, in addition to the possibility of StuCons jeopardizing their own safety.,Nevertheless, the campus safety policy needs to be changed. Perhaps a select group of StuCons could be specially trained in dealing with violent situations and could be given the ability to physically intervene when necessary. Another alternative would be to give Campus Security this kind of physical authority: Campus Security supervisors currently have greater training and are not students.,Another concern with campus security is the current emergency protocol. If StuCons feel they are unable to control situation, they have the choice to either contact Campus Security or the Kingston Police. Often, StuCons will first call Campus Security, who, due to a similar hands-off policy, may subsequently need to call the police. In situations where time is of the essence, this middle step may be a serious impediment to conflict resolution or much-needed medical attention. Although Campus Security may provide yet another form of authority to deter individuals from rowdy behaviour, they are also prevented from using force.,The multiple steps required to control a situation may be one step too many when serious situations arise. It would be more efficient to have individuals on site with the jurisdiction to use force when necessary."},{"title":"Darts & laurels 2005/06","url":"/story/2006-04-06/editorials/darts-and-laurels-200506/","date":"April 6, 2006","content":""},{"title":"Construction on campus","url":"/story/2006-07-25/editorials/construction-campus/","date":"July 25, 2006","content":"Dear Frosh,,Welcome to Queen’s. Don’t forget your hard hat.,It’s unlikely the University has told you that you are arriving at a time of tumultuous transition and extensive construction. It is a lot easier for the school to focus on the beautiful new buildings they will enjoy in the future, and play down the burden this places on current and incoming members of the Queen’s community.,In Fall 2006, Queen’s will welcome many changes to its campus. In addition to projects aimed at cosmetically improving Union and University Streets, three coffee shops will be added to the campus: The Tea Room, an environmentally friendly tea and coffee shop will be operating; a café will also be added in the previously underused Victoria Hall basement common room. The third coffee shop will open in the lobby of Stauffer Library, but not until Thanksgiving. This raises an important question: do students really need another place to buy coffee? With Stauffer already becoming a social meeting place, adding a coffee shop won’t improve the number of distractions students already experience while trying to study. Also, because it was not built during the summer break, it will now be another needless interruption during an important time in the school year.,This is all without mentioning the mother of all construction projects: the Queen’s Centre. Phase one will begin this year, and construction will continue for at least 15 years. An entire block of houses must be knocked down, with clearing expected to take months. The dust, road closures, and ongoing noise from the digging up of pipes and underground infrastructure is bound to interfere with students daily activities as well as their overall satisfaction with campus life.,The Queen’s Centre construction was pre-planned and expected, but it seems that the other renovations are either unnecessary or poorly timed. The campus atmosphere is a big part of why many students come to this university. Due to the volume of ongoing construction projects, many will miss this part of Queen’s. We recognize the need for Queen’s to grow, and we wouldn’t want to stand in the way of progress. But unfortunately for you, dear Frosh, although you will spend four years enduring extensive construction, you won’t reap the eventual benefits."},{"title":"The \"Culture of Whiteness\"","url":"/story/2006-05-30/editorials/culture-whiteness/","date":"May 30, 2006","content":"Released in April, the Henry Report has sparked discussion among students and faculty about the “culture of whiteness” at Queen’s.,In 2001, the former Vice-Principal (Academic) Suzanne Fortier was prompted to conduct a survey concerning racism experienced among faculty following the resignation of six faculty members within a short period of time.,York University professor emerita, Frances Henry’s findings have been criticized by some for their questionable scientific merit; nonetheless, concerns highlight a need to address diversity at Queen’s.,Hiring practices should acknowledge the necessity of having a more diverse faculty. According to the report, there are only 117 of the 1,378 faculty members who identify themselves as being of colour and/or Aboriginal.,This is not to say that an affirmative action approach is the only solution. Rather, hiring committees should strive to increase the diversity in the pool of applicants considered for various faculty positions.,Henry cites Queen’s as having “Eurocentric curricula.” While expanding the curricula is a good step, prospective faculty of diverse backgrounds should also never be pigeon-holed into teaching race-related topics that may not coincide with their areas of research.,And the “culture of whiteness” Henry points to in her report extends beyond just the faculty. At Queen’s, it seems to be more a matter of ignorance than “systemic racism” among students. Last Halloween, a white student dressed in blackface, pretending to be Miss Ethiopia. Although the student may not have been trying to offend anyone, she certainly demonstrated a tremendous lack of sensitivity and awareness on race issues, and perpetuated the school’s reputed “culture of whiteness.” The greater problem at Queen’s, though, is a culture of inaccessibility, which breeds a culture of elitism and exclusion. The elitist reputation of Queen’s is perpetuated by high tuition costs. The university should continue to look for ways to make Queen’s more accessible rather than seeking to specifically recruit racially diverse students."},{"title":"Learning from Sukaina Ali’s death","url":"/story/2006-06-27/editorials/learning-sukaina-alis-death/","date":"June 27, 2006","content":"On April 10, Sukaina Mohsin Ali, a first-year student from Pakistan, died in her residence room—a death that family members have said was preventable. When a tragic incident occurs, it's natural for those involved to shift accountability to others in an effort to cope with the situation. In Ali's case, it would be wrong to suggest that there was a single cause for her death.,Ali came to Canada from Pakistan, despite her diagnoses of depression and anorexia. Upon her admission, Ali's parents attached a letter from her psychiatrist informing the University that \"she would need monitoring by a general physician and counselor.\" Unfortunately, this letter was never forwarded to the people who would help Ali on a daily basis and ensure her health and stability.,Nobody in the University has acknowledged receipt of this letter, and it seems as though it may have been lost amidst multiple levels of bureaucracy or was restricted from view because of its highly personal nature.,The letter went unseen by so many people who could have made a difference in Ali's life, which exposes our bloated administrative bureaucracy and the problems with confidentiality. If something so important is completely confidential, how can anyone benefit? Ali's parents went out of their way to inform the University of their daughter's problems, yet the documents were considered too private or were misplaced somewhere between admissions and Residence Life Coordinators.,One of the people who would have benefited from seeing this letter was Tammy Ma, Ali's residence don. If she was aware of Ali's previous condition, perhaps she could have been better able to help her.,After Ali's death, Ma left Kingston for almost a week. While it must have been a traumatic and difficult time for Ma, she should have stayed in Kingston to be with the other students of which she was in charge. It is a don's responsibility to assist students, especially in crisis situations.,Vice-Principal Patrick Deane told students that an investigation into Ali's death will be completed and further information will be released.,Hopefully, the University can learn from this tragedy to ensure it won't happen again."},{"title":"Separate schools a thing of the past in Ontario","url":"/story/2006-03-03/editorials/separate-schools-thing-past-ontario/","date":"March 3, 2006","content":"At the Conservative policy conference in Niagara Falls on Feb. 20, Ontario Conservative Party Leader John Tory reignited debate over the public funding of Catholic schools in Ontario when he introduced his 2007 election campaign “that addresses the fairness issue for independent schools.” While he did not commit to restoring the $3,500 tax credit introduced by Mike Harris to given to families who are paying for their children to attend private, religiously-affiliated schools, he did not completely discount it.,According to The Globe and Mail, “he said the party still has to work out details such as whether money would be given to the parents or directly to the religious schools, but indicated families who use non-religious private schools may not qualify for any proposed assistance.”,While it is good that Tory is acknowledging that it is not fair to favour one faith with public dollars over another, the idea of giving a tax break to all families who use private schools—many of whom are not in financial need—seems less likely to promote equality of opportunity and more likely to foster the image that the public school system is a tax burden.,The initial establishment of this two-pronged education system was done in order to appease the Roman Catholic population in Canada, who would not enter into confederation until there was a guarantee that the Catholic school system would be protected.,However, that was in 1866, some 140 years ago. The agreement was made when the majority of the population was Christian. These days, Canada has become a multicultural patchwork of many people of different faiths and it is clear the Ontario school system only represents one piece of this patchwork.,In November 2005, the UN called for Canada to “eliminate discrimination on the basis of religion in the funding of schools in Ontario,” following a complaint filed in 1996 by a Jewish parent who sent his child to a private Hebrew school.,Government use of taxpayers’ money to fund the separate school system only benefits the Catholic population in Ontario. In order to be completely equitable, funding should be provided to all schools of all denominations. This, however, is not practical considering the multitude of faiths represented in the province. As such, plans should be put into place to gradually phase out the two redundant school systems in favour of one larger public one. And while this will inevitably be difficult, considering how long the system has been in place and the strength of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association, it is still a necessary change that needs to happen.,At the same time, it is clear that many students and parents of all faiths are interested in religious education. To provide it in an equitable manner, the government should consider offering various religion courses in public schools for example, providing all students with the opportunity to learn and embrace their faiths. The demographics of each public school’s surrounding community could also be considered in deciding the courses offered.,Eliminating an overlapping and increasingly inadequate religious public school system need not mean creating a raft of cookie cutter, aggressively secular public schools. The government and school boards must simply be prepared to be flexible in recognizing diversity and in truly accommodating faith."},{"title":"To Canada’s snob laureate","url":"/story/2006-02-07/editorials/canadas-snob-laureate/","date":"February 7, 2006","content":"Dear Ms. Atwood,,Make no mistake, I am a fan of your literature. The Handmaid’s Tale was one of few books I genuinely enjoyed in high school, and I think your poetry is wonderful.,But let’s talk about your recent literary pursuits for a moment. Oryx and Crake, while a decent read, was by no means amazing for someone like you. In fact, I have a feeling that for the last 20 years, you have been recycling the same material over and over again, much in the same fashion à la—dare I say it—John Grisham or Stephen King. But I must admit: you do it well, you write so swell.,But ... Penelopiad? Did you have to sell out to the gimmicky publishing scheme and mildly humiliate your reputation? Granted, I did not read the book, but popular opinion tells me that it was received lukewarmly at best. I am puzzled as to why you agreed to do this: were you in dire need of extra cash? Did you feel your name was growing dusty, fading into the distant past amalgamated as the “twentieth century?” Of course, I’ll never know the truth, but I have the right to keep wondering.,But all this is quite minor. What really motivated me to speak up was an article I read in the online archive of The Guardian. In the article, you said you wanted to invent a “remote book-signing machine” so that you didn’t have to do any more “grueling tours.” The benefit of this technological creation, you stated, was “a lot less angst, inconvenience, starvation, sitting in airports and eating out of minibars.” The article further indicated that the machine would resemble Rumsfeld’s automated signature writer for the soldiers killed during the Iraq war, but more intricate.,Ms. Atwood, we need to talk.,I understand that you are a busy person. I also understand you are now considered a heavyweight in the literary world. And people who are considered important are allowed to act with a certain level of pretense and snobbery before they are labelled a “snob.” This, however, is beyond all measures of acceptable pretensions.,You see, people show up to your book signings because they like you. They liked your book well enough to come and actually TELL you how much they liked it. Isn’t it nice? Didn’t you like getting positive feedback as a newly aspiring writer? I know you probably have enough credentials to not need outside feedback anymore, but surely you remember that warm, fuzzy feeling.,Those people want to take time out of their busy day to come meet you in person. They want to talk to you about your work and be inspired by you. And who knows, there is a chance you might learn something new from them too.,Much of literature has become—sadly—a solitary activity, but surely you remember that literature started with an oral tradition that carried on a strong sense of community, communication and camaraderie. Frankly, I am flabbergasted by your audacity—no, arrogance—to somberly suggest such a cold-hearted and impersonal device, while you have made a name for yourself as an author revealing the stark effects of alienation in human nature.,Remember that time you got on CBC and taught viewers how to play soccer? That was the first time I noticed Margaret Atwood had a sense of humour, and I liked her. Please tell me she’s coming back soon."},{"title":"Learning curve in store for new rector","url":"/story/2006-02-14/editorials/learning-curve-store-new-rector/","date":"February 14, 2006","content":"With a margin of just 17 votes over Tom Woodhall, Johsa Manzanilla will become the University’s next rector. A race as tight as this shows just how divided voters were. It’s disappointing that someone as qualified as Woodhall was not given the opportunity to continue contributing to a school he has already done so much for. He ran a solid campaign that showcased his grasp on the issues facing students. However, we hope Manzanilla will work hard to fill the shoes of such respected institutional figures as Grant Bishop and Ahmed Kayssi.,This year in particular, elections never seemed to end, with campus elections immediately following the federal elections. It is unfortunate that the rector elections were so overshadowed by the AMS executive elections—not to mention ASUS and the 31 referendum questions—considering the importance of the position. Perhaps in the future, the elections team will consider mandating that rector elections be held separately from AMS executive elections to ensure all candidates have the undivided attention of students.,If anything, Manzanilla’s win is a testament to the strength of her campaign. She had the greatest presence and made her voice heard in many classes. Now that she has secured her position, we hope Manzanilla will be less aggressive than she was during her campaign, especially if she intends to be as accessible to students as she promised. The rector must work with University administrators rather than against them. During the campaign period, she stuck to three main issues and rarely strayed from them: Homecoming, diversity on campus, and tuition deregulation. While these are indeed pertinent issues, they are not the only issues, and Manzanilla will have to learn to address all the University’s issues with the same force and confidence.,The race for rector was close. If anything, it should be an indication to rector-elect Johsa Manzanilla that she has a challenging job ahead of her. We wish her the best of luck."},{"title":"Enjoying life, guilt-free","url":"/story/2006-03-03/editorials/enjoying-life-guilt-free/","date":"March 3, 2006","content":"The Beatles had more than a few famous lines in their popular songs: “All you need is love;” “I believe in yesterday;” “We all live in a yellow submarine.” Excellent lyrics, boys, but none are really ringing true for me right now. In addition to love, I need at least a steady flow of caffeine. Since I spent most of my waking hours yesterday writing a paper about anti-globalization movements in Brazil, I definitely don’t believe in yesterday. And the last time I checked, I live in a slightly ghetto house, not a yellow submarine.,So maybe some of the Beatles’ most famous lines aren’t going to offer me any inspiration during the inevitable mid-term doldrums. As I struggle to remain focused for the last couple of months of the school year, however, a quote of John Lennon’s keeps running through my head: “Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted.” Case in point: I woke up Saturday morning with an ambitious plan involving a second-floor cubicle in Stauffer and a considerable amount of research that had to be done for the aforementioned essay. I had visions of staying at my little cubicle all day, breaking only to refuel on coffee or perhaps to take a quick lap around the floor to keep my blood flowing.,What I actually did, however, was spend most of the day enjoying brunch with a couple of friends. We spent hours talking about everything and nothing, about having to make choices that could direct where our futures go, about wanting to escape from it all and start a slow-living commune in Chile. We were alternately serious and hilarious. We annoyed the waitress by sitting around for far too long without paying, or perhaps by being obnoxiously loud. We considered sticking around until dinner, but real life called and we moved on.,Despite enjoying the day, I returned home feeling more than slightly guilty that I didn’t even come close to accomplishing my scholarly goal. “You just wasted an entire day,” the scolding voice in my head told me ominously.,And then I found John Lennon’s quote where I find all good quotes: in a friend’s MSN name. And the more I thought about it, the more I agreed with him: “Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted.”,Taking a minute (or a few hours) to relax, talk about life and enjoy the company of friends isn’t wasting time. It’s enjoying time, which is the way it should be.,I’m not going to look back on my years here and think: “Wow. Some of the best times I ever had at Queen’s were when I spent all day in the library, glaring at the people who dared to raise their voices above a whisper.” I’m going to remember the good times—laughing so hard it hurts over a stupid joke, enjoying a good meal out with family, nights of revelry with friends, random late-night conversations that last until morning.,Which isn’t to say I’m going to focus solely on making those good times happen all the time. They wouldn’t be special if they weren’t interspersed with the bad days and the seemingly never-ending hours of studying. But it’s important to relish the fabulous moments when they come and not feel guilty about enjoying them, and I intend to do more of that."},{"title":"I don’t play the ‘lame’ game","url":"/story/2006-02-17/editorials/i-dont-play-lame-game/","date":"February 17, 2006","content":"On AMS election night I was sleepily awaiting a photo op when, to everyone’s surprise, a familiar beat came bumping through the halls. At once the rhythm drew everyone to their feet, and as they sprang up to see what was the matter, I heard one bystander snarl “they’re lame girls” in reference to the male artists at hand.,“Mmmbop:” that’s right kids, “Mmmbop.” As I grooved to some classic prepubescent harmony behind the doors of the AMS, onlookers dared to shut down my joy with nine-year-old superficial criticisms and recycled ignorant remarks about how “lame” Hanson is. “Lame” is a word I use far too often, and in the realm of music I would be happier if we could cut it out. You’re supposed to enjoy music, and you’re supposed to smile when you hear your favorite song. You aren’t supposed to be afraid of whether or not everyone else thinks you made a cool choice. Obsessed with the harmony-wheeling threesome since birth, my sister was pumped for her second Hanson concert and invited me along and ... I went. It was positively splendid. I am now smitten with their platinum heads and frankly, I want my posters back.,One problem I have with criticizing the music people listen to is that it’s often a case of judging the “lame”-looking book by its cover. Most music bashers have no idea what they’re talking about, myself included. They haven’t taken the time to actually educate themselves about the bands they criticize. Let’s get educated, shall we? In 1997 Hanson released their first album which propelled them to massive pop fame at an intense pace, particularly their songs “Mmmbop” and “Where’s The Love ... .” With number one hits, world tours and bags of money in the can, these kids were only 11, 13 and 16 when they were signed to a major record label, Mercury. But alas, what has been happening in the major label industry lately? Britney Spears and Nick Carter’s little brother, that’s what! After realizing how depressing the music industry is today and leaving Mercury/Island Def Jam behind, Hanson started their own independent record label, “3CG Records,” and they are now past their eighth album release. Record labels are moving away from the fine days of quality bands and towards manufactured quick-sell hits with disposable one-time use artists who can’t even sing, let alone write.,Hanson didn’t die. As most people would say, they went “indie.” The band now writes, records, produces and releases their own music, not to mention the fact that they have always penned their own songs and played their own instruments, Britney. Their last album, Underneath, is one of the most successful independently released records in history, entering the Billboard Independent Chart at number one. This past year Hanson played at university campuses across the United States on a tour entitled “Are You Listening?” During the tour, the band also led discussions regarding the corporate versus independent music scenes. They have been earning nothing but praise as a mature and genuine indie rock band and they are simply just adorable. The hair is gone and the masculinity is shining through, dear bystander, just ask the pit of screaming twentysomethings I left back in the T-dot.,My name is Katrina and I like Hanson."},{"title":"CFRC funding drive a worthy cause","url":"/story/2006-01-31/editorials/cfrc-funding-drive-worthy-cause/","date":"January 31, 2006","content":"Last Friday, Queen’s radio station, CFRC, began its two-week long funding drive. Their goal is to raise $5,000. If successful, CFRC programming manager Eric Duncan will tattoo the CFRC logo on his body. This is the first time in the station’s 84-year history that it has ever had to raise money. Three years ago, the University sold CFRC to the AMS. Since then, funding from the University gradually phased out, leaving CFRC with only what is provided by the AMS mandatory student fee, not nearly enough to cover operating costs. CFRC is operated by the AMS, so if the CFRC were to lose money, the loss would be covered by the AMS.,However, the station is looking further into the future than the end of a single fiscal year. While the AMS will cover the loss, if CFRC loses great sums of money, it will inevitably face pressure from the AMS to cut back. Rather than allowing this to happen, the CFRC is making a sincere effort to sustain itself.,CFRC is not solely a student radio station; it has an audience that widens to the greater Kingston community. It is refreshing alternative to the commercial programming by providing a variety of sounds and broadcasts that might otherwise never be heard. It is also a great place for people to gain valuable experience in radio broadcasting. While it may not appeal to the masses, it has never tried to; rather it presents its listeners with the opportunity to hear unique and eclectic programs. It has been around for 84 years and we hope it will be around for at least 84 more."},{"title":"Love stinks—literally","url":"/story/2006-02-10/editorials/love-stinksliterally/","date":"February 10, 2006","content":"With Valentine’s Day coming up, love is on the brain ... or is it on the nostrils? Some say you can fall in love with someone for their eyes, laugh, intellect, acerbic wit, or firm pectorals, but for their aftershave? Like it or not, scent plays a hell of a role in your level of attraction—or unattraction, for that matter—to a potential paramour.,Pheromones, tiny secreted chemicals, elicit a major subconscious response from members of many species. Insects go nuts for pheromones, relying on them heavily to dictate their rules of attraction, though in human beings, the effects of sex attractant pheromones remain heavily-contested in the realm of science. But after a long night at Alfie’s, you can really start to wonder about the power of these supposed reactors.,Back in the mid-1980s, the Washington Post published an article about the effects of human pheromones, specifically in regards to pioneering research by Dr. Winnefred B. Cutler.,“You might say that exposure to pheromones is the essence of sex,” Cutler told the Post. But even researcher Dr. Martha McClintock—who sparked the whole pheromones debate back in 1971 with her analysis of the synchronization of women’s menstrual cycles living in close proximity to one another—is skeptical of Cutler’s assertions. According to an article on the American Psychological Association’s website, McClintock concludes that in terms of humans, pheromonal effects aren’t that cut and dry. McClintock asserts that pheromones are never guaranteed to elicit a particular response between humans, unlike insects, or some other members of the animal kingdom. Context is a crucial determinant in the effect of pheromones for human beings.,“It’s like saying that if you see a red light, you cannot control yourself from stopping no matter the circumstance,” McClintock said in the APA article. “Human behaviour just isn’t like that in any domain.” Touché, scientist.,Still, no one will discredit the effect of at least scent upon human beings, pheromones or no pheromones, natural or manufactured. Sure, our cognitive abilities will factor into whether the way a person smells makes us want to hit them or kiss them. But think back how closely you can associate scent with memories in your life. My grade 10 boyfriend wore Polo, and to this day I think of him every time I smell it. Burberry and salt air reminds me of a guy I dated last summer—and consequently makes me slightly volatile.,Call me shallow, but I once ended things with a guy in grade 12 because he smelled too musty. And if, while slow-dancing with a guy, I catch a whiff of a well-balanced mix of aftershave and sweat, I’ll be damned if it doesn’t do a certain something.,Pheromones or no pheromones, I say love stinks–literally."},{"title":"Valentine’s without the valentine","url":"/story/2006-02-14/editorials/valentines-without-valentine/","date":"February 14, 2006","content":"OK, cats and kittens, I’m going to steal a page from the book of my illustrious colleague Tricia Summers. I too would like to use this space to talk about love, since it’s Valentine’s Day and all.,But if you’re looking for something about the science behind the emotion, you should pick up a copy of last Friday’s paper, because Tricia did that better than I ever could. Instead, I’m going to talk about not being in love.,It goes like this: I’m single, and I have been all my life. So yes, that means I’m a virgin—yes, I’ve never been kissed—and no, I’m not really sure why any of that is, other than my various severe personality defects and hygiene issues. (I’m kidding—I think.) There doesn’t seem to be any one reason for my singleness. Dating just hasn’t happened for me yet. And you know what, dear reader? I’m OK with that.,In our society, I sometimes feel a pressure that says you have to become attached to one person, and that if you aren’t, you’re somehow defective.,But there’s a lot of love in my life. I have family members I couldn’t live without, and friends whom I adore. Yes, those are different types of love from a grand, sweeping romance, but my life is still the richer for them. On most days, they ensure that I don’t want for anything.,Of course, some days are different. One of my excellent housemates just got engaged to her wonderful longtime boyfriend, and I’m honestly so happy for them I think I might break something. But on some (infrequent) days, I want what they have so badly I can’t stand it.,I wonder what’s wrong with me, and why I’m alone. I wonder if that will ever change. I fear it won’t.,But once I’ve concluded my boring pity party, I remember how generally lucky I am. I remember all the things in my life that make me happy—like laughing with dear friends, having dinner with my parents and sister and working at this humble paper—and I realize that I need to stop whining.,What more could a boyfriend really add to that list, one that already warms the cockles of my heart—and what a strange expression that is—so well?,Thanks to my extended family, I have been given examples of several different lifestyles. We have four married couples, three single women and two divorcés (both of whom are currently engaged or dating).,As of the last time I talked to them, they are all—as far as I can tell—pretty happy. I feel perfectly sanguine about following any of their paths. Indeed, I would consider myself lucky to do so well as each of them has.,As I write this, my music player has put on the Beatles’ “When I’m Sixty-Four.” I think it would be an amazing thing to have somebody to grow old with like that, renting cottages in the Isle of Wight and naming grandchildren and what have you.,But I don’t think my life will be empty or worthless if that doesn’t happen for me. It certainly isn’t now.,In conclusion: Happy Valentine’s Day, one and all, single and attached. I plan to spend the big night drinking with my housemates.

I’m reaching the end of four years here, and I’ve recently started to realize I’m approaching the last of a lot of things, including, in this space, my last signed editorial.,I’m currently also witnessing my last AMS executive election campaign, and I’m trying to decide what vote I want to cast on behalf of those first-year students who’ll arrive on campus this fall to take on the Queen’s the Class of 2006 left behind.,The main thing I’ve learned about AMS elections over the past few years is that promises are the least important thing in an exec campaign. The AMS as an organization is often extremely limited by its financial resources, bureaucracy, and high turnover, as well as by its relationships with other groups within and outside the University.,Election promises therefore mainly showcase a team’s desire to come up with some kind of solution to some hot-button problem, in an effort to appear engaged and visionary to as many potential voters as possible in a short span of time.,As a senior student with a modest amount of perspective on student governance, I couldn’t care less about their promises.,Instead, I care about their character and motivation. The most successful AMS execs I can remember have also been the least slick or visionary during their campaigns. They just worked like dogs all year on whatever students asked them to do, and accepted the inevitable criticism with humility and grace. Can you, prospective execs, do the same?,Can you prove to me that you can work just as hard on mundane, unforeseen issues as on those in your specific platform? Can you prove you’ll deal respectfully and fairly with every staff member in your organization and every member of the public? Most importantly, can you prove you’re not seeking office for your own prestige? I’ll tell you right now that not all of you have me convinced.,That having been said, AMS teams who want anything more than a spoiled ballot from me must make one promise tied closely to the strength of character I’m looking for. Underpinning my perspective on elections and student governance are the four years I’ve spent working for this newspaper, interviewing and writing about student politicians, covering elections, and observing the reactions of student officials to the work that we do.,I’ve also learned a lot over those four years about the constant battles that take place between the AMS and the Journal. Almost every year, there have been suggestions, attempts and even threats—not by the wider body of students we serve, who have on balance expressed confidence in and satisfaction with their student newspaper, but by senior AMS staff—to bind the Journal more tightly to the AMS bureaucracy, or to change the policies and structures that keep the AMS and the Journal as independent from each other as possible.,Candidates, you won’t get my vote, and probably not those of the other students who work here, unless you can convince me you won’t go along with that; that you’ll actively strive to understand what it means to have a strong student newspaper and to make sure there’s one on campus for the Class of 2010 and beyond—despite what that newspaper might say about you.,On this topic, I take a lot of convincing. Just a heads-up."},{"title":"Ice rink indicative of slipping leadership","url":"/story/2006-03-10/editorials/ice-rink-indicative-slipping-leadership/","date":"March 10, 2006","content":"The resignation of Campus Activities Commissioner Louis Plamondon on Feb. 9 followed a series of circumstances that did not bode well for Plamondon. He had taken a leave of absence to run Team MBT’s campaign. Upon his return, he met with AMS VP (University Affairs) Shiva Mayer and AMS Information Officer Greg McKellar. During this meeting, Plamondon was given the option to either resign or take a one-month suspension. While the reasons for such actions are not completely clear, the unfinished and over-budget ice rink to be built on Leonard Field and the Campus Activities Commission’s (CAC) financial woes seem to be contributing factors.,Plamondon’s resignation has called into question the need for the ice rink in the first place. With free ice time available at Jock Harty Arena, in addition to the open ice rinks at Victoria Park, City Park and the Market Square, it hardly seems like another rink needed to be constructed. While it may be convenient for first-years and those living on campus, traveling the short distance to the other rinks throughout the city would help dispel the idea of the Queen’s bubble and would be an opportunity for students to better integrate themselves into the community.,More than anything, the financial loss created by the Leonard Field ice rink points to a lack of communication between members of the AMS. Plamondon should not have signed a contract with students he hired to build the rink without consulting the executive. At the same time, the executive should have better monitored Plamondon’s actions—the CAC’s current $22,000 deficit did not incur spontaneously or without warning.,That said, Plamondon was able to elevate the profile of the CAC and he did establish several campus-wide activities and events—but not without a price.,In an interview with the Journal just after his resignation, Plamondon said “It was a question of choice: do I keep up with CAC as my number-one thing, or do I go all out with this election? I could only choose one, and I chose the campaign. ... Quite frankly, I want to enjoy my last two months [before graduating] as a normal Queen’s student.” When you apply and are successful at securing a position, you agree to fulfilling the mandate of that position, regardless of whether or not your priorities change. As it stands, the CAC has been forced to scramble to pick up after Plamondon. He has demonstrated a complete disregard for AMS policy and for the system itself. Rather than resigning, Plamondon should have taken the one-month suspension that was offered by the AMS as an alternative to resigning. This would have allowed him to return to the CAC and complete the work he started."},{"title":"Cautious about campus corporatization","url":"/story/2006-02-10/editorials/cautious-about-campus-corporatization/","date":"February 10, 2006","content":"Queen’s University Against Killer Coke (QUAKC) recently received a $2,000 grant from the Cold Beverage Exclusivity Fund (CBEF). The CBEF monies are provided by Coca-Cola as a condition of its on-campus exclusivity agreement, but a group of University faculty and students decides who receives these grants.,QUAKC’s decision to use the money provided by the Coca-Cola grant to fund its campaign to terminate the University’s contract with Coca-Cola may be a clever twist, but it also seems hypocritical. The group defends their use of this money by saying they need it for their “Killer Coke” campaign. This is the argument the University uses for agreeing to the contract with the company: they needed the money. This grant, however, is not QUAKC’s only fundraising option.,The Coca-Cola contract is indicative of a growing trend in post-secondary institutional funding. More and more, everything from sports complexes to art centres are being constructed using corporate money.,Despite the trend, corporate sponsorship is not inevitable when it comes to post-secondary funding, nor should the University uncritically accept private funding. In the current climate of post-secondary funding, external funding is an appealing option since governments have cut back on their contributions to post-secondary institutions, but it is important to keep lobbying for increased government funding. Thus far, Queen’s has run a successful alumni fundraising campaign. Continuing such initiatives in the future could prevent campus corporatization. It has also recently been announced that Starbucks will have a brewing station in the Mackintosh-Corry cafeteria. Although the coffee will be fair trade, the introduction of Starbucks is a testament to the brand power mentality; it clearly wasn’t so much the quality of the coffee that was the basis for the decision, as there are many better choices, but the brand recognition, which will translate into bigger on-campus coffee sales.,The introduction of Starbucks and QUAKC’s ongoing battle against the University’s Coca-Cola contract point to the need for a set of guidelines to regulate the corporate presence on campus and protect the views and interests of students, who remain one of the University’s largest and most stable sources of funding."},{"title":"Freedom of speech not the issue","url":"/story/2006-02-14/editorials/freedom-speech-not-issue/","date":"February 14, 2006","content":"The UPEI student newspaper, the UPEI Cadre, was the focus of controversy last week when it was pulled from newsstands by the university’s administration for having reprinted a controversial series of editorial cartoons depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammed. First printed in September by Jyllands-Posten, a Danish,newspaper, the cartoons have been the cause of protests and demonstrations all over the world, including Toronto and Montreal.,Originally, they were intended to criticize the perceived censorship of the Danish media; however, the implications of the drawings have elicited heated responses. Jyllands-Posten has since apologized for soliciting and printing the cartoons, but publications like the UPEI Cadre have still chosen to reprint them.,Edward Greenspan of The Globe and Mail put it aptly in his “Letter from the Editor” when he said that not reprinting the cartoons is “a question of editing,” not censorship. Although we at the Journal firmly stand behind freedom of the press and freedom of expression, we do not support the decision to print such blatantly offensive caricatures, especially with the knowledge that in Islam, it is strictly stipulated that Mohammed is not to be artistically represented.,While the UPEI Cadre’s position that the cartoons facilitate dialogue is somewhat understandable, reprinting the cartoons was not the only way to discuss the ramifications of respecting religious beliefs in the context of freedom of the press. We believe that to reprint them would be a gratuitous attention-getting strategy, particularly when the cartoons have already been so widely circulated online. As Greenspan wrote, “it didn’t seem to be a matter of publish and be damned, but more like ‘damn you,’ and publish, a course bound to generate more heat than light.”,The violence in response to these cartoons is not constructive, however. If anything, it is further propagating and fuelling belief in the negative stereotypes depicted by the cartoons. Recently, Tehran’s Hamshahri, Iran’s top-selling newspaper, has proposed its own contest requesting caricatures about the Holocaust. The Times reports the Hamshahri’s graphics editor as having said: “the Western papers printed these sacreligious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression, so let’s see if they mean what they say and also print these Holocaust cartoons.” This strategy of testing public reaction to content known to have the potential to offend—the same one employed by Jyllands-Posten in soliciting and printing the cartoons—will likely contribute to further violence and xenophobia.,The university administration should not have pulled the UPEI Cadre from campus. Freedom of the press is, after all, a right. However, it is a right that must be exercised respectfully and responsibly, which Jyllands-Posten and the reprinting newspapers failed to do. That said, the backlash that has ignited, particularly the call for Holocaust cartoons, will offer no solution and will more likely add fuel to the flames."},{"title":"Canada’s impressive Olympic performance","url":"/story/2006-03-03/editorials/canadas-impressive-olympic-performance/","date":"March 3, 2006","content":"Canada’s performance at the winter Olympics in Torino, Italy was impressive, with an amazing 24 medals, one shy of the Canadian Olympic Committee’s optimistic prediction. Not only did Canadian athletes have the third-largest number of podium finishes, but many of our athletes, while not medaling, achieved personal bests or finished very close to the podium.,Canadian women had a great showing, including Cindy Klassen’s five medals and the Canadian women’s ice hockey gold medal. This demonstrates the success of Canada’s equal support of women’s sports. It was clear at these Games that nations are beginning to recognize the importance of funding women’s sports, and hopefully in Vancouver in 2010, countries will be sending more female athletes to compete.,The greatest disappointment of the Games for Canada was undoubtedly the men’s ice hockey team’s failure to medal. While the focus has been on Wayne Gretzky and his team selection, the fact of the matter is, several good teams were vying for the podium and Canada simply did not play up to par.,The focus has been on medals, but we cannot forget the personal bests and close finishes our athletes achieved. With any luck, Canada’s performance in Torino is a precursor to even greater things in Vancouver."},{"title":"Students need to be university-savvy","url":"/story/2006-01-31/editorials/students-need-be-university-savvy/","date":"January 31, 2006","content":"A recent Globe and Mail article revealed that university recruitment methods have become much more aggressive than in the recent past. It used to be that students were often forced to wait until as late as April to hear from the universities they had applied to. Now, according to the article, acceptances— often along with hefty scholarships—are handed out as early as October to exceptional students universities are seeking to recruit. Some schools are even giving conditional offers based on a student’s grade 11 marks.,While it is good to see universities reaching out to students, it has also added to the pressure of the decision-making process for students. Ontario has seen a complete overhaul of its curriculum and the elimination of OAC. With universities courting bright students so soon after their applications are sent, or even before their applications are sent, they leave less time for students to consider their options. Competition is high for universities to secure top students. As Carleton’s associate vice-president of student and academic support services Ann Tierney said, “like everything, university admissions is something that is a competitive industry.” York University has even taken to making house calls. The Globe and Mail reported that “David Huckvale, the associate director of recruiting said that along with mailing offers to A students, a small subset of that group with 95 per cent averages and higher will be paid home visits by recruiters, who will hand deliver offers.” According to Angie Saweczko, manager of Canadian recruitment at York, prospective students meeting a certain GPA “are called and congratulated for receiving admission to York. At that time, students are asked if representatives from York can personally deliver the letter of acceptance. However, it is not mandated how the letter is delivered, whether representatives come to their houses or schools, some students choose to pick the letter up at York.” While students will arguably be able to see beyond the flowers and chocolates, so to speak, of this courtship, the offer of a scholarship and the extra attention is still tempting and will at least get students to consider a school they may not have considered before. It is a reality for many students that often the school they choose to attend is directly related to the amount of financial assistance offered by the school, whether they need the money or are simply flattered by the attention.,At a time like this, students need the help and support of their guidance counselors. The guidance councellors need to inform their students about the different options available—not just university. A university that is willing to come to your house may not be the university that best fits your needs. In reality, only a small fraction of high school students—namely those with 90 plus averages—will be receiving this kind of red carpet treatment from universities. It is also important for parents to remind their children that while an early offer of acceptance from one school is good, they are in no way obligated to attend that particular school.,Ultimately, however, the decision still lies in the hands of the students. Like all of us, they will have to decide which school is best for them, and not necessarily the school that is the most prestigious or gives them the most free stuff."},{"title":"Harper’s cabinet an insult to democracy","url":"/story/2006-02-17/editorials/harpers-cabinet-insult-democracy/","date":"February 17, 2006","content":"When Stephen Harper announced his cabinet on Feb. 6, no one anticipated that Liberal David Emerson would be a part of his cabinet as the Minister of International Trade and Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics. Another surprise was Michael Fortier’s appointment to the Senate and to the position of Minister of Public Works, considering Fortier didn’t run in the election. The re-emergence of members of former Ontario Premier Mike Harris’ government is also a source of anxiety.,The Conservatives defend that Emerson’s crossing the floor is in no way reminiscent of Belinda Stronach’s move last year. When Stronach crossed the floor to join the Liberals, the Tories were up in arms and had harsh words to say about Stronach and the Liberals. According to cbc.ca, Harper said of his party: “We don’t go out of our way to romance MPs to get them to cross the floor. Liberals will do anything.” Peter MacKay, reports The Globe and Mail, said that “unlike other moves, it didn’t happen at a critical juncture that propped the government up.” However, Emerson’s move to the Conservatives gives the party a critical stakehold in British Columbia, and more so, a major city like Vancouver.,For a party that campaigned on a platform of transparency and honesty, Harper’s decision is neither transparent nor honest. Throughout the election period, Emerson was a vocal critic of the Conservatives—he even went so far as to declare himself “Stephen Harper’s worst nightmare” reported ctv.ca. Yet when offered the ministerial position, he did not hesitate to make the change from nightmare to bedfellow.,In becoming a Conservative in a staunchly Liberal riding, one might wonder if Emerson will adequately represent his constituents in Vancouver-Kingsway. In this riding, the Conservative candidate received only 18 per cent of the votes in the election, behind the Liberals and the NDP. It doesn’t seem as though Emerson even considered his constituents when he made his decision, despite the fact that it is because of them he is in the House at all.,Micheal Fortier’s appointment to the Senate is a blatant by-pass of the democratic process. Harper once said that the Conservatives “are trying to create a principled party where people act in a principled way.” Fortier’s appointment if anything, demonstrates a lack of principles. Not only has Harper undermined the electoral process, but he has also undermined the efforts of individuals who, unlike Fortier, actually campaigned during the election.,Additionally, the appointment of former Ontario MPPs Tony Clement and Jim Flaherty from the Harris era does not sit well, considering the amount of damage that government did to the province.,Stephen Harper’s decision to name David Emerson and Michael Fortier to his significantly smaller cabinet is indicative of his strategy to have Conservative representation in all parts of the nation. However, the lack of a serious Conservative presence in British Columbia and Quebec prior to Harper’s appointments, was telling of the incongruity of support for the Conservatives."},{"title":"Google censorship reveals oppression","url":"/story/2006-02-03/editorials/google-censorship-reveals-oppression/","date":"February 3, 2006","content":"Google announced last Wednesday it would launch a version of its popular search engine in China, something the company has been trying to do for some time. But there’s a catch. In order for Google to enter the Chinese market, it had to create a censored version of its search engine.,According to an article by the Associated Press, google.cn “omits independent websites from searches about human rights, Tibet and other topics sensitive to Beijing. Instead users are directed only to websites espousing the government’s views on such issues.” A simple image search of “Tiananmen Square” at google.ca yields 13,500 results, with the first being images of the tanks and protesters that crowded the square, although the number of websites keeps changing. However, a search at google.cn using the exact same words yields 36 results, none of which feature any tanks but provide tourism and architectural details instead.,Google Inc.’s motto is “don’t be evil.” However, it seems that by succumbing to the pressures of the Chinese government, they have succumbed to a certain kind of evil. Despite denying the U.S. government’s attempts to acquire information about individuals’ web searches and representing itself as a company that opposes infringing on the privacy of individuals, all of Google’s credibility is undercut by the concessions it has made to China.,But ultimately, mottoes and activism aside, Google is not solely to blame for censoring its Chinese site. The Chinese government, in censoring searches, has only further perpetuated the Orwellian notion of surveillance and has stolen a fundamental freedom from the people they are supposed to be representing. If China is to have a more prominent presence on the world stage, it must first evaluate its governance and reconsider such censorship tactics.,Time seems to be slowly closing in on the Chinese government, and although it may think it has achieved some kind of victory in censoring Google searches, the publicity and outrage their decision has elicited proves otherwise."},{"title":"Canuck women’s hockey plays hard, but fair","url":"/story/2006-02-17/editorials/canuck-womens-hockey-plays-hard-fair/","date":"February 17, 2006","content":"The Canadian women’s hockey team has been in the media hotseat recently for its seemingly merciless performance in the Olympics in Torino, Italy. The team beat Russia in its opening game 12-0 while dominating in its games against Italy and Sweden, with final scores of 16-0 and 8-1, respectively.,With such significant leads, the team has been criticized for being relentless and persistent in racking up large scores. Many have said that the team should have eased up in order to allow the losing team to at least save face.,The way the tournament is structured, the team with the most points scored will be awarded home ice advantage and the last line change for the gold medal round. The Canadian team has defended that this home ice advantage is the reason they have not eased up in any of their games.,It is looking like a two-team race between Canada, who is in Group A and the U.S., who is in Group B and will be a definite threat to Canada’s Olympic gold aspirations. It makes sense that the Canadian women’s hockey team is trying to score as many goals as possible in order to gain home ice advantage, as any advantage would help in the final game. It does nothing for them to ease up and ease into bad habits before playing against the Americans.,It also hardly seems right for the Canadian team to make the conscious effort not to play as hard. If anything, it is an insult to the opposing team. At the Olympics, athletes who are identified as the best in their countries come to compete against equally talented opponents. They arrive knowing they will be challenged and if they were not prepared to face such challenges, they would not have come to the Games in the first place."},{"title":"AMS exec teams head down the final stretch","url":"/story/2006-02-07/editorials/ams-exec-teams-head-down-final-stretch/","date":"February 7, 2006","content":"This year, it’s been more difficult than usual to pick an AMS candidate team worthy of representing students as AMS executive. While no team has promised to “Crack the Clique,” students have certainly heard their share of slogans and seen their share of gimmicks.,As the AMS executive election draws to a close, the Journal has reflected on the platforms and campaigns of each team. If the Journal had a ballot to rank the candidates, this is what it would look like:,1. Team MBT: They’re not an outstanding option, but of all the teams, this team would best represent the student body. Their proposal to introduce the AMS to first-year students and encourage their involvement through weekly dinners with all residence floors seems like a genuine commitment to engaging more students; however, it doesn’t seem feasible given the cost of each dinner and the number of floors in residences. Similarly, the plasma screens on campus are a good idea in theory—we can see the point in trying to find a more effective way to inform students about the various events on campus. But again, it could become yet another expense the AMS cannot afford. It is also difficult to reconcile spending tens of thousands of dollars on plasma screens when something less costly and perhaps more necessary, like After Hours Childcare, has been eliminated in the name of saving money. Their platform of 12 months, 12 promises demonstrates a sincere effort on their part to ensure accountability. We only hope that in trying to fulfill these 12 promises, other responsibilities do not fall short. MBT is well-intentioned with their ideas and, while we are leery of whether or not they will be able to follow through with every single one of them, we do believe they will put in the most effort and work the hardest to fulfill these promises.,2. Team HPR: Their “Jump in the Lake” gimmick and surveys have succeeded in engaging students in dialogue and encouraged them to come forward with their concerns. At the same time however, it shows a lack of direction and a lack of focus in terms of their platform. While student opinion is important, the next AMS executive should present to students its own mandate which it intends to fulfill rather than adopting a “go with the flow” type of attitude. Their intention to implement a 20 per cent salary cut and replace it with performance-based bonuses is not a sound idea given that they have not clearly outlined a way to ensure accountability as to how exactly these performance-based bonuses will be determined. From the debates, it is clear that Team HPR lacks a definitive presence. While their ideas may be good, an inability to articulate and defend these ideas does not demonstrate to students their ability to represent the student body to the Administration and city officials. On numerous occasions, the candidates have spaced out, and the vice-presidential candidates in particular were unable to articulately answer questions.,3. Team HML: Coming into this election period, Team HML clearly had the most experience. While this experience will help them get things done, students do not need to be reminded of it at every possible opportunity and they most certainly do not need to be met with a condescending attitude because of this experience—if anything, their experience should have taught them that. Their slogan “Fight Back” is problematic because it perpetuates the “us and them” mentality between students and the city, which will do nothing to improve town-gown relations. Although students often receive unwarranted blame, there are also instances in which students have in fact behaved deplorably and should be reprimanded. Adopting this “Fight Back” mentality could end up protecting those who frankly should not be protected, in addition to those who are in fact innocent. What’s more, Team HML’s intention to influence the Kingston Whig-Standard’s editorial board meetings will not help to improve relations with the city and shows their lax, somewhat worrisome approach to editorial autonomy. While we agree this team has what it takes to fulfill their platform ideas, their approach of “Fight Back” is too aggressive, and they have not appeared entirely trustworthy or sincere.,4. Team SHT: From the beginning, given their slogan “there’s no ‘I’ in team SHT,” there was speculation as to whether or not this was the “joke team.” And throughout this campaign period, this team has failed to prove otherwise. The team’s website alone is replete with offensive comments about other candidates. Regardless of who posted these statements, the fact that the comments have, until recently, remained on their site demonstrates a lack of professionalism and is indicative of what we could expect, were they to be elected. The sporadic absences of two of the team’s candidates throughout the campaign shows a lack of dedication and perhaps a lack of confidence in their own abilities to succeed in this election.,It is not up to the Journal to make decisions for the students, however, and we hope that students will become informed about each team’s platform. It is paramount that students vote and have a say in who will be spending our money and representing us to the University and the City of Kingston."},{"title":"AMS executive debates uninspiring","url":"/story/2006-02-03/editorials/ams-executive-debates-uninspiring/","date":"February 3, 2006","content":"Last night, in the Lower Ceilidh, AMS executive candidates participated in the final debate before students go to the polls. Even though candidates have had plenty of time to prepare—the campaign period is already over one and a half weeks in and two other debates have taken place—the teams were inarticulate and generally unimpressive.,Diane Phatsaphaphone of Team HPR was unable to clearly articulate her answers and it was often difficult to understand what exactly she was trying to get across. Also, Phatsaphaphone’s running mate, Jennifer Raffoul, suffered many lapses during the debate and apologized on several occasions for losing her train of thought. If these are the same individuals who hope to be our representatives to the administration and other University and city officials, their performances at the debate were not only dismal, but enough to plant seeds of doubt about the capabilities of the team.,The absence of vice-president (operations) candidate Nancy Huynh did not bode well for Team SHT. What was worse, Jonathan Scarlett did a particularly poor job of representing Huynh by proxy; it was so bad that it seemed like he knew absolutely nothing about his teammate. At one point, when an audience member asked a question about what the teams would do about the lack of diversity on campus, Scarlett noted that Huynh was a member of Japanese Relations at Queen’s (JRQ) and “one of those Chinese clubs.” The constant plugging of their website was annoying, and often a diversion from providing detailed answers.,Although HML came across as the more polished team, they were unnecessarily aggressive, bordering on hostile. While force and confidence are needed for a successful team, instilling fear and intimidation isn’t exactly an invitation for students to approach them. At different times during the debate, Dave Homuth was caught saying “when I am elected,” undercutting the team aspect of this election.,Team MBT seemed more like they were running for a high school election than the leadership of an $8.7 million not-for-profit corporation. Meghan Teuber, when answering a question about how her team would address transgender issues, made the point that there are no transgender washrooms on campus; however, she was quickly informed that in fact, there is one in the JDUC.,Although all teams stayed focused and maintained a respectful tone throughout the debate, they had a generally poor presence and appeared unprepared to debate the issues. Frankly, they looked nothing like people who should hold three of the highest positions on campus."},{"title":"Playing nice with the SHRC","url":"/story/2006-02-03/editorials/playing-nice-shrc/","date":"February 3, 2006","content":"Why is it that so many people have reservations about their sexuality? Especially at this period in our lives, it’s perfectly normal to engage in intercourse, to masturbate, and find ways to satisfy ourselves. But when I mention my newest purchase from the Sexual Health Resource Centre, I’m often met with disgusted or ashamed expressions.,Yes, I masturbate. But I’m not ashamed of it. As Woody Allen said in Annie Hall, “Don’t knock masturbation—it’s sex with someone I love.”,There isn’t anything wrong with owning, or wanting to own a sex toy. My egg (a small, egg-shaped vibrator, attached to a battery pack) is immensely satisfying. I can declare that I’m proud to own one, and that I’m happy to be among the students who are making the transition to this form of sexual exploration, thanks to the SHRC.,Located in the upper-level of the JDUC in the clubs space, the SHRC is a safe and welcoming place for students to find sex toys, condoms, and information about safe, healthy sex. In addition, it provides resources about birth control methods and pregnancy options.,I discovered the SHRC through a close friend in second year. Although I was apprehensive at first, I began visiting the Centre earlier this year. On one occasion I was given the guided tour of every sex toy, condom and lube available at the Centre by a friendly Sexpert. The tour didn’t spawn awkward conversations, and I didn’t resort to a quick exit. Instead it was surprisingly comfortable, and gave me a breadth of knowledge of these ominous multi-coloured, multi-shaped objects sitting on shelves.,I left the Centre feeling accomplished—I had learned so much about how to enjoy the big O. The Centre has an assortment of sex toys, ranging from $5 to $50, including a mock-up of the famous Rabbit sex toy. A pack of eight regular latex condoms costs a mere $2 and female condoms are also just $2 a pop. All of their products are sold at cost, so they are significantly cheaper than ones you would find in an adult boutique or local drug store.,It took me a while, however, to warm up to the idea of actually purchasing something at the SHRC, aside from the ordinary condom. Purchasing a sex toy was a big step for me—I was ashamed of what people might think. For a long time, whenever I masturbated, I felt a strong sense of guilt. I thought that what I was doing had to stop, that it was something worthy of shame, and completely unnecessary. Much like nail biting, masturbation was a habit that had to be broken.,Thankfully I’ve gotten out of this mindset. I discovered that I wasn’t the only one who enjoyed self-gratification, and eventually came to accept that masturbation was a form of healthy sexual exploration.,I’m now in a healthy relationship that allows me to be comfortable with my sexual activities. I continue to meet people at Queen’s who share my values of sexual well-being. And I’ve made a trip to the SHRC to pick up my very own sex toy."},{"title":"Non-academic discipline needs clarification","url":"/story/2005-11-25/editorials/non-academic-discipline-needs-clarification/","date":"November 25, 2005","content":"Last week, the AMS and SGPS each presented draft reports of their preliminary recommendations on the non-academic discipline system to the University Senate. They were mandated to do so by the Principal’s Task Force on Community Relations which had recommended “strengthening the mandate and resources of AMS and SGPS for addressing non-academic discipline with a focus on off-campus student behaviour.” The SGPS raised concerns at the meeting as to the scope of the Code of Conduct. As it stands, the Code of Conduct could potentially be applied to discipline a Queen’s student who breaches the Code anywhere in the world. The boundaries of the Code of Conduct should be clarified and reinforced during the welcoming ceremony, even before students sign on the dotted line to confirm their acceptance to Queen’s, and thus their agreement to abide by the Code of Conduct.,SGPS President Dave Thomas also suggested that undergraduate students are being held to a lower standard of lawfulness by the Kingston Police because officers believe students should be disciplined under the Code of Conduct instead of the law. The purpose of non-academic discipline, however, is not to replace legal consequences, but rather to complement the legal system.,The SGPS should recognize that, if the problem they indicate does exist, it has less to do with the University’s system of non-academic discipline, and more to do with the perspective and conduct of police. Perhaps in addition to informing students about the Code of Conduct, the University should also make the police aware of the jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct, stressing the complementary purpose of the Code and emphasizing that it does not replace any legal consequences students who break the law should face."},{"title":"Tides of the campaign are changing","url":"/story/2006-01-13/editorials/tides-campaign-are-changing/","date":"January 13, 2006","content":"Monday night’s final English debate was the stage for a change in the direction of the election campaign.

Harper behaved more like a prime minister than an angry and disgruntled opposition leader.,Moderated by TVO’s Steve Paikin, the debate was much more organized and orderly than in years past. Paikin successfully controlled the leaders, asking pointed questions and bringing them back if their answers seemed to stray.,In a surprise move, and most likely an election tactic, Martin promised to remove the notwithstanding clause from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In the past, Harper has suggested that he would use the clause to strike down same sex-marriage legislation but has since said that he would not.,A noticeable absence at the debate was the Green Party of Canada, which has just received public funding after garnering four per cent of the vote last election. The parties invited to the debate should not be decided by television programming executives.

It is unfortunate that many Liberal incumbents seemed to lose because of their affiliation with the party, regardless of how much they had contributed to their ridings in the past.,Canadians have voiced their disappointment in the Liberals by placing their support behind the Conservatives. While they will potentially help change the way government is carried out, uncertain whether some of this change will actually be beneficial to the country.,The Conservatives conducted a smart, well-tailored campaign presenting Harper as more of a moderate than he has appeared in the past. As hard has he has tried to sell himself as a man for the people, Harper fundamentally does not represent the values of all Canadians. His plan to cut the GST is flawed. Ultimately, high-income Canadian families stand to benefit from the reduced consumption tax more than the moderate- to low-income families who consume less. We still don’t know what Harper will do with regard to the free vote on same-sex marriage and use of the notwithstanding clause. Adding to our anxiety is the fact that in his first speech as prime minister, Harper referred to Canadians as “taxpayers” and focused on economic and fiscal policy rather than issues like health care and education. What’s more, he ended with a George W. Bush-style “God bless Canada,” calling into question his the perspective from which he will govern.,Locally, Peter Milliken coasted back into the House without much of a fight. We hope that as a member of the opposition he will take a more active role in representing Kingston and the Islands on Parliament Hill.,It was encouraging to see that the NDP won more seats, ensuring an increased alternative presence in the House from the traditional major parties. Similarly, early in the night, the Green Party showed signs of an electoral berth, which unfortunately, was not meant to be. Although the party still doesn’t have any seats, the rise in support in this election for local Green Eric Walton suggests that a Green presence is on the horizon. This election, more than any other, shows that Canadians want more options—two-party governance is not enough. Perhaps an increased diversity in the House will promote the kind of constructive dialogue and co-operation we have been calling for all along.,While a change in government was inevitable, and despite our apprehension, we truly hope that the Conservatives will reinvigorate Canada’s confidence in its leaders. With the election now behind them, it is important for all parties to make a sincere effort to co-operate and get things done."},{"title":"Bush getting away with outsourced torture","url":"/story/2006-01-27/editorials/bush-getting-away-outsourced-torture/","date":"January 27, 2006","content":"On Tuesday, Dick Marty, the head of an investigation being conducted by the Council of Europe into possible human rights violations committed by the United States, revealed there is growing evidence that the CIA sent detainees to other countries in order to subject them to the kind of interrogation not permitted within the U.S.,The New Yorker printed an article in February 2005 presenting evidence of an “Extraordinary Rendition” program in which suspects are flown to countries like Egypt, Morocco, Syria, or Jordan. Once there they are subjected to unspeakable torture. The U.S. has consistently denied the existence of any such program despite the mounting evidence and the growing number of victims of such torture. How the Bush administration continually gets away with it is mind-boggling. However, information is beginning to surface. Their treatment of former CIA operative Valerie Plame is one such example. And in 2003, Mahar Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian was exonerated of any terrorist involvement only after having endured beatings and other forms of torture in Syria after being deported there by the U.S. He put it aptly in an interview with The New Yorker: “They are outsourcing torture because they know it’s illegal.” It seems the U.S. government has transformed this “war on terrorism” into a war on freedom and the rights of the individual. No one is really free, not even Americans with Bush’s recently uncovered wiretap surveillance on American citizens. Bush and his administration seem to think that they are above the law. It is commendable that news outlets like the New York Times and The New Yorker are not letting him slip under the radar. As a society, we cannot allow the Bush administration to get away with these atrocious actions. We need to voice our opposition and let the U.S. administration know that international laws do indeed apply to them, contrary to what they may think."},{"title":"Maclean’s misrepresents youths’ civic interest","url":"/story/2006-01-17/editorials/macleans-misrepresents-youths-civic-interest/","date":"January 17, 2006","content":"The Jan. 16 issue of Maclean’s contains an article titled “Stop him before he votes” with a puzzling photo of a young man sporting sunglasses and holding a peeled banana. The authors of the article present the notion that 18-year-olds are “too immature to vote,” and take it a step further in suggesting that the voting age should be raised to 21.,They write that “kids today” are not the same as they were back in 1970, when the voting age was reduced to 18. In essence, they argue, young people today are comfortable living off their parents, moving “willy-nilly from job to job.” If anything, the fact that the job market is becoming increasingly unstable, often prompting students to stay in school longer, are reasons why young people should be voting. Education and employment are political issues that deeply affect youth.,The article goes on to say: “put kids with half-baked brains in a North America that’s learned to coddle its young and you get a group of voters who can’t manage to scratch an X on a ballot.” This statement is not only baseless, but it is as far away from the truth as the article is from good journalism. Voting is not the only way young people are involved in their communities, and voter turnout is hardly an accurate measure of whether or not we care about issues that concern us. At our university alone there are clear signs that students care: just look at all the clubs, committees, and councils on campus, not to mention the party signs that are springing up around the Ghetto during the current election campaign. Perhaps this perceived apathy is a symptom of the ineffectiveness of current efforts to engage young people in politics. This, if anything, would be more of a reason to lower the voting age in order to encourage young people to vote. If we did, we might get young people into the habit of voting before they leave home to pursue their education or take on “willy-nilly” contract employment.,Further “evidence” presented in the article includes findings that “teenage brains are underdeveloped, particularly in areas dealing with judgement and impulse control.” If we were to use this finding as our main criterion for determining an individual’s capacity to vote, it could also be applied to those of older generations who may have experienced an age-related deterioration of the brain and consequently, the individual’s abilities. Few older Canadians are likely to support introducing a maximum voting age on these grounds, however.,The Maclean’s article also features a photo of the overturned car on Aberdeen Street last September with KCVI student Zola Mehlomakulu atop it, with the caption: “Why don’t politicians listen to us? Queen’s University students celebrate homecoming.” The photo was used out of context, however, and its caption missed the well publicized fact that Mehlomakulu is not, in fact, a Queen’s student. It is disappointing that a magazine with as wide a circulation as Maclean’s has resorted to such shock-value tactics, trading journalistic integrity for readership."},{"title":"Maple music appreciation","url":"/story/2005-11-25/editorials/maple-music-appreciation/","date":"November 25, 2005","content":"There are certain things about the Great White North that I noticeably miss when I’m at home in California. The people. The familiarity of the Queen’s campus. Doughnuts from Tim Hortons. Colourful money. Seasons. Not having to listen to people make Canada jokes every five minutes.,At the end of this summer, though, I added a new item onto the list. It was refreshing to hear, as I cruised along the 401 from the Toronto airport to Kingston on my way back to Queen’s after a long summer, a song from Blue Rodeo’s newest album playing on the radio. Canadian music was something I didn’t realize how much I missed until I got to enjoy three hours of CRTC-approved entertainment.,I could complain for a ridiculous amount of time about the reasons why so many Canadian artists never make it past the 49th parallel and lament the ubiquitous nature of American culture, but the frustrated complaints of an ex-expatriated Canadian probably wouldn’t garner too much attention from anyone. Giving the musicians the attention they deserve within their own country, however, is a bit more plausible.,When I first heard about the CRTC guidelines for radio stations, I was confused. Why make radios play music that they might not normally choose to play? If the music was worth playing, radio stations would give it air time without being forced to do so, I thought.,It didn’t take long, however, for me to realize the importance of having such guidelines.,In other countries, local music has a very definitive sound, whether it be due to language, instruments or style, and is easily distinguishable from the influx of music coming from the U.S. Canada doesn’t have that luxury, and so we need some way to separate our music from that of the States. Encouraging air play of Canadian artists was the government’s answer to the threat of the overpowering American industry. While the CRTC guidelines limit the freedom of media outlets, they provide a way for the artists who don’t have the means to compete with the American labels to showcase their talent.,Most of my American friends have never heard of the Tragically Hip, The Trews, Leonard Cohen, Sarah Harmer, Paul Brandt or any of the other Canadian artists that I’m so fond of listening to. On the rare occasion that these bands venture down south, they play to crowds a fraction of the size of those they attract at home. While Great Big Sea plays to sold-out arenas of quasi-teeny bopper fans in Canada, in the U.S., dislocated Canadians and those interested in hearing “popular Celtic” music make up the modest crowds.,There are a number of Canadian musicians who have made a name for themselves south of the border, but I’ve noticed a disturbing trend of such artists giving up their Canadian identity in favour of American success. While it upsets me that many talented artists are unrecognized beyond our borders, I’m glad that they haven’t been discouraged by the lack of attention and that they have instead chosen to embrace their homeland, content with more local success.,It isn’t just about supporting Canadian artists—it’s about giving musicians the recognition they deserve, whether they’re well-known internationally, nationally or locally, and encouraging the creation of quality music amidst a world of indiscernible noise."},{"title":"Here we go again ...","url":"/story/2005-12-01/editorials/here-we-go-again/","date":"December 1, 2005","content":"The dissolution of the Liberal government means we’re in store for yet another season of campaigning. This untimely event could potentially put a damper on the upcoming holidays. Since its inception a mere 17 months ago, Paul Martin’s minority government has faced obstacle after obstacle. According to the Toronto Star, a national Ipsos-Reid poll conducted on Nov. 29 reported that the Liberals and Conservatives are currently neck-and-neck, each with 31 per cent of the country’s support. Meanwhile, the poll reports that the NDP have 18 per cent of the nation’s support.,It is unfortunate that over the past 17 months the parties could not set aside their respective agendas to allow for the normal processes of government to take place. Instead of taking advantage of the minority to influence positive change and provide representation to a broad cross-section of Canadians, the opposition parties chose to approach each major issue as a possible opportunity to call an election.,Now that an election has been called, we hope that all parties will realize that negative, “dirty” campaigning is not what the public wants to be subjected to. Similarly, in order to deter this sort of campaigning, we need to make it clear that it is ineffective in swaying our votes.,In a tight electoral race, our votes will count more than ever and it is important that as young people, we take advantage of this chance to make our opinions heard."},{"title":"Squeam & shout","url":"/story/2006-01-13/editorials/squeam-and-shout/","date":"January 13, 2006","content":"Before we begin, do you mind standing in front of me for a moment? I forgot to insert my morning anal suppository, and I need someone to shield me from what could be an embarrassing moment.,That’s better.,Having a doctor tell me five days before Christmas that I had ulcerative colitis wasn’t as bad as having to drink a solution 24 hours before my first colonoscopy that tasted like the dregs of a diesel truck’s oil filter.,My gastroenterologist—no coincidence the word “gas” is in his title—said I needed to cleanse my colon before he could start recording the most spectacular America’s Funniest Home Video I would ever see.,Thankfully, I was knocked out cold by a milky fluid injected into my veins before the tape began rolling. As for the colon cleansing, think Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber.,And now, to regulate my diet and to be proactive about my condition, I’ve had to ban two staples almost indispensable to a university student’s diet: caffeine and alcohol. More importantly, I found out colitis was an inflammation of my colon that is chronic but won’t kill me.,When I eventually found out about my new irritable bowel disease, the news didn’t come as much of a surprise. You can only bleed from your rectum so many times before you begin to wonder if something might be wrong.,But the difference between wondering if something is wrong and telling a doctor something is wrong is the same distance between Mars and Venus.,I waited almost two years to literally get to the bottom of my condition. And my reticence had nothing to do with the state of Canadian health care.,What the hell is wrong with me and every other chest-thumping lout who thinks he’s invisible? Too much Don Cherry? Too much of our grandfathers’ generation telling us we can’t admit something is wrong and get help?,The taboo surrounding men’s heath and well-being doesn’t help. A father asks his son to pass the peas at dinner—and by the way, are your testicles lumpy? Or a doctor, before dismissing a male patient after his annual physical, says: “Everything seems to be fine, but because of your age I suggest a barium study of your intestines.”,Awkward moments aside, educating men about squeamish conditions would help overcome the machismo conundrum. I say this only because I’m a victim of double jeopardy. Six years ago, I didn’t know the signs and symptoms of testicular torsion. When one of my testicles swelled to the size of a small clementine, I thought it was growing pains.,I didn’t know testicular torsion was a condition in which a testicle strangles itself around the spermatic cord it’s attached to. I didn’t know it’s prevalent during infancy and one’s early teen years. I didn’t know organs can only last six hours without oxygen before they become poisonous to one’s body.,Listening to squeamish terms in an awkward conversation is much better than living with one testicle and shoving suppositories up your ass.

The film’s release of the film was postponed until January, and it was removed from the Montreal World Film Festival after its screening encountered considerable public opposition.,Interestingly, the film was originally titled Deadly. It was subsequently renamed Karla following Homolka’s release after serving 12 years in prison for her involvement in the murders of three teenage girls, including her younger sister, Tammy.,While the producers and all those involved have a right to freedom of expression and to make the film, we do not necessarily see the benefit in doing so. Some might argue that some critically-acclaimed films, like Monster, Boys Don’t Cry, and Dead Man Walking are based on true, gruesome stories. However, the exploitive nature of the film seems to disregard the families of Bernardo’s victims, Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy, for whom the events will forever remain a reality. If anything, Karla serves as a painful reminder of the torture these young women suffered.,As mentioned, Karla is not the first and certainly won’t be the last film that is “based on a true story.” The fact that producers have invested money in the film shows that they expect people to go out and pay to watch it. This points to a deeper societal issue. We need look no further than the popularity of television shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Law&Order: Special Victims Unit, in which characters are brutally murdered on a consistent basis. The reasons why people watch are endless. It could simply be human curiosity, and our fascination with horrendous and tragically true events. It might also be our way of understanding why these crimes take place or symbolically bringing justice to the victims each time these shows end with the bad guys being caught.,Karla has been marketed as a warning against predators, and its publicists have even gone so far as to encourage parents to take their children to watch. The film is hardly appropriate for children, however, and it will interrupt the opportunity for dialogue that must take place between parents and their children.,Before going to watch Karla, we simply ask that you consider the implications of this decision, out of respect for the victims’ families and for confirming to film and television producers that there is an appetite for reliving a gruesome reality."},{"title":"Chasing the dragon","url":"/story/2006-01-24/editorials/chasing-dragon/","date":"January 24, 2006","content":"January and February are never easy months to get through. The winter break is over, summer break seems light-years away, and no matter where in Canada you live, the weather is less than stellar. But there has always been one holiday that has kept me going through this dreary season: Chinese New Year.,Ever since I can remember, my entire family would go down to Main and Pender in Vancouver and stand bundled up among milling crowds to watch what was, for me, one of the greatest shows on earth. I would elbow my way to the front of the crowd and crouch on the curb, or, when I was very small, cajole my parents into putting me on their shoulders so I could get a better view. No matter how many times I witnessed this monumental event, I never failed to be awed by the spectacle. We were passed by brightly costumed dancers with ribbons and parasols; marching bands of every stripe; community clubs and organizations marching with colourful, multifarious banners. Firecrackers were set off, their intimidating volume and exotic, acrid smell as fascinating as they were frightening. But the best part of this thrilling parade was always, always the dragon dance. I would sit with bated breath, watching the dancers and musicians go by, waiting for that moment when the dragon would come snaking down the street. A dancer in a papier-mâché mask with chubby, red cheeks pranced mischievously before the brilliantly plumed beast. The dragon tossed its enormous head, adorned with tassels and bells, with huge googly eyes and a gaping mouth. To the beat of drums it leapt high in the air and shivered its sides in mock fury. I had never seen a more terrifying and wondrous creature.,Once I was old enough to realize that the dragon’s four feet were wearing sneakers, I knew I had found my true calling: I would be a dragon dancer. I would perform and bring the magic of this moment to life. Naturally, once I expressed this desire to my more realistic—and cynical—friends, they were quick to point out the major flaw in my reasoning. I was not Chinese, and Jewish white girls tend not to participate in a dragon dance on Chinese New Year. I was crushed. Years later, I have gained enough realism and cynicism myself to know that, even if I were allowed to do the dance—and who knows? maybe I would be-I am far too much of a klutz to even begin. That doesn’t detract from the joy I get from watching it, though. The dragon dance, for me, embodies Canada’s multiculturalism in a way that nothing else can. Looking back, the people crowding those sidewalks, whose knees I elbowed past to get a good view, were from all over the world. Yet we all came to watch this parade—to see the bright colours, to hear the drums and the music, to smell the enticing aroma of dim sum wafting out of restaurants down the street. And to watch the majestic dragon dance.,Next Sunday, Jan. 29, is this year’s Chinese New Year. I don’t know if Kingston has a parade, or how that will be celebrated. But I know that in my mind’s eye I will hear the drums, and see the dragon toss its head."},{"title":"Living the quarter-life crisis","url":"/story/2006-01-20/editorials/living-quarter-life-crisis/","date":"January 20, 2006","content":"There is an almost palpable vibe of panic in the air amongst fourth-year students these days. As we inch closer and closer towards the intimidating void of post-university life, everyone seems to be asking the same terrifying question: “What on earth am I going to do with my life?” The concept of leaving the undergraduate lifestyle behind can produce a state of existential crisis in even the most level-headed young adults. This pressure can lead to bouts of choking insecurity and stress, which are especially unwelcome for already-harried fourth-year students. Although there are many ways to describe this dilemma, it is most commonly referred to as “the quarter-life crisis.” As a graduating student in the throes of my very own quarter-life crisis, I decided to get to the bottom of this phenomenon. I began my search by flipping through my trusty Oxford Canadian Dictionary, but as I rifled through the Qs, I was disappointed to learn that the phrase “quarter-life crisis” was nowhere to be found—not even in the “New Words” appendix. However, the up-to-the-minute dictionary.com provided me with the following definition: “an emotional crisis in one’s twenties with anxiety and self-doubt after leaving academic life.” Intrigued, I decided to further my research with a quick look on chapters.indigo.ca. A search for “quarter-life crisis” garnered titles such as What to Do When You’re Twenty-Two: A Survival Guide for the Quarter-Life Crisis; 20-Something, 20-Everything: A Girl’s Guide to Balance, Direction, and Contentment During Her Quarter-Life Crisis; and Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique Challenges of Life in Your Twenties. After I recovered from the overabundance of colon-saturated titles, I realized the earliest publication date for any book dealing with quarter-life crises was 2002.,After this exhaustive research, I realized that although the quarter-life crisis phenomenon is a well-known aspect of student life, it has only become prevalent amongst non-student types within the past few years.,My research also left me with one pressing question: why has it suddenly become so horrifying for young adults to enter the working world?,These days, a bachelor’s degree is simply a means to an end. The value of an undergraduate degree has greatly diminished within the past few years, and as a result, very few people graduating with arts or science degrees begin their careers directly after university. I myself have yet to find an English factory desperate to employ me upon my graduation.,Finishing a university degree is also accompanied by some frightening implications. I feel more like a scared kid than a confident twenty-something graduating from university, which is often seen as synonymous with entering adulthood. It’s as though we must suddenly become financially independent, fully functional “grown-ups,” though most of us are barely 23 years old and up to thousands of dollars in debt.,Graduating students know that come April, we must leave the comforting womb of studenthood and be cruelly forced into the “real world,” armed only with our feeble bachelor’s degrees. Like so many others, I am standing on the precipice of adulthood, ready to face the intimidating leap into the future. I can only hope that my experiences will balloon out behind me and ease my descent into post-university life."},{"title":"How I lost & found myself","url":"/story/2006-01-27/editorials/how-i-lost-and-found-myself/","date":"January 27, 2006","content":"I have a confession to make: before coming to Queen’s, I had actually considered going into fine arts. It seemed like a viable option at the time: I had an insatiable desire to draw, and I felt learning in an environment which encouraged such creativity would make a fine arts program a no-brainer.,Then reality sank in. Maybe I hadn’t practiced enough, or maybe I didn’t have the same kind of motivation as the others; an overly harsh voice in my head told me I wasn’t good enough. It’s painful, when you realize one of the things you enjoy doing so much is the same thing that won’t make the cut. Then, from one love to another, I turned to English. I can write as well as draw, I thought at the time. I believed it was the right choice.,In the past, I wondered if I had made the right choice, as tumultuous clouds of “What ifs” stormed through my head. At times I think I’m just as confused now as I was back then. I’m in my third year, and my future still looks murky to me.,I envy those who know where they’re going and go there with a laser-like focus of dedication and motivation. They’re the same people who have their careers mapped out in front of them: all they need to do is follow the directions. I don’t have that sense of direction, because I’m split between two things I love. I want to write, but at the same time I want to exercise my artistic capabilities. If you find me a job offering with those two combined, you will have my undying love (for whatever it’s worth).,Before, I was afraid to pursue one of my major interests to the fullest because I’m afraid of abandoning the other. It’s like a Catch-22: it’s difficult to excel in one area without giving it your all, but you want to keep your options open at the same time. Whenever I think about this it feels like I’m in first-year again, clueless and hopeless. It kinda sucks: it seems like I’m the only person who has or had this problem, and it’s at once somewhat depressing and embarrassing. Maybe everyone else really does know where they’re going.,But despair leads you nowhere—that’s the message I kept telling myself. I resolved to hone my artistic skills while expanding my breadth of literacy in my pursuit of an English degree. I know that I am able to excel in anything I do; all I have to do is cast off my shackles of self-doubt and take off.,This is a message to all the people out there who feel lost or confused: you’re not alone. You’ve got a friend in me, as well as all those other Queen’s students who are either undeclared or have changed their major 15 times. The future is never certain, but it’s up to you to turn it to your advantage. You’ll figure yourself out ... and when you do, you’ll be awesome.

Many voters are still undecided, indicating the state of limbo the country is in and perhaps the closeness of the race.,Amidst all the ads and all the insults, the leaders have focused on the faults of the other parties, failing to offer reasons why they should be elected. The main theme of the Conservative and NDP ad campaigns has been “we’re not the Liberals, vote for us.” The Liberals, conversely, have done little but paint Stephen Harper as a dangerous politician with a hidden agenda. But this is not enough of a reason—or at least, it shouldn’t be. Unfortunately, some voters will buy into this and vote strategically rather than putting their support into a local candidate they actually have confidence in. Lost in all of this is the fact that yes, we are electing our prime minister, our representative on the global stage, but we are also electing candidates who will best represent our ridings and our local interests.,In terms of the actual candidates, it is disappointing that of the six candidates running in Kingston and the Islands, there isn’t one woman and there isn’t one member of a visible minority. The slate is hardly representative of the constituency it is competing to represent. A similar gap between candidates and voters seems to characterize the election as a whole. The parties need to be reinvigorated with new faces and clearer platforms if they plan on engaging the next generation of voters.,Voters, too, need to realize that involvement in the democratic process is not confined to casting a ballot on election day. Communicating with MPs is important in ensuring that our voices are heard. They are our representatives and are ultimately, accountable to us.,The election is going to be tight, and although we are always told each vote counts, now is a time when that is all too true. Most likely the election will result in another minority government. We can only hope that this time around, the parties will forget about trying to bring down the government and focus on co-operating to create one."},{"title":"Christmas Child has no place in residence","url":"/story/2005-11-25/editorials/christmas-child-has-no-place-residence/","date":"November 25, 2005","content":"As a Change Project for their Commerce 351 Leadership class, a group of students decided to pitch the idea that dons and students in residences participate in Operation Christmas Child, a worldwide project run by Samaritan’s Purse, a self-described “nondenominational evangelical Christian organization.”,Participation in Operation Christmas Child involves filling shoeboxes with gifts such as toys, stationery and hygiene products, which will then be delivered to children in another part of the world where Samaritan’s Purse does missionary work. Along with the gifts, a booklet about Jesus Christ and Christmas is distributed with the boxes.,On the Samaritan’s Purse website, Operation Christmas Child is described as an “opportunity for people of all ages to be involved in a simple, hands-on missions project while focusing on the true meaning of Christmas—Jesus Christ, God’s greatest gift.” The letter that was sent by the students to Residence Life should have made it clear that Operation Christmas Child is a religiously affiliated project. While the terms “Christmas” and “Samaritan’s Purse” already have religious implications, the letter should have better outlined exactly what religious ties the project has. Not all Queen’s students are comfortable supporting an evangelical organization.,That said, when approached with the idea of participating, Residence Life had to only take a look at the Samaritan’s Purse website to see that Operation Christmas Child is an evangelical project. With this in mind, they should have refrained from advertising and facilitating the program, perhaps instead opting to look into a non-religious organization with similar aims.,Participating in Operation Christmas Child in residence was ultimately a decision made by the dons. Students in residence should not feel obligated to participate in a project they fundamentally disagree with, which they may if their dons are promoting it. A non-religiously affiliated organization like Residence Life should not be involved with Operation Christmas Child and should have instead followed the lead of the Limestone District School Board in suggesting that groups better suited, like local churches, should take on the project. The AMS has also declined to run the project this year because of its religious implications.,In the letter sent to Residence Life, the students involved should have done a better job of properly representing the sentiments as well as intentions of Operation Christmas Child. They should have clearly outlined the fact that the project is part of the larger Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian group. Interestingly, due to low participation numbers, the students have had to organize another Change Project in support of Tree of Life, a Kingston charity for which volunteers purchase gifts for needy local children. Tree of Life is a good example that many children can benefit from a helping hand at Christmas, and they can be helped through organizations other than Operation Christmas Child."},{"title":"The Journal’s AMS & rector election wish list","url":"/story/2006-01-24/editorials/journals-ams-and-rector-election-wish-list/","date":"January 24, 2006","content":"Following the barrage of attack ads and smear campaigns we were subjected to during the federal election campaigns, students can sit tight for round two with AMS and rector elections just around the corner.

It adds diversity to the choices and provides a different perspective. In the history of the position, there have been but three female rectors.,In past AMS executive election campaigns, we have heard slogans about raising the bar, cracking the clique, and choosing a new style of student government. Unfortunately, many of these slogans have led us down a deceptive road of broken promises, leaving us feeling disappointed and thoroughly unsatisfied.,Although it’s too early to say which teams will come out of the starting blocks first, we can say what we hope to see from them. While catchphrases and carefully arranged campaign posters might garner attention, they won’t necessarily guarantee votes.,Teams should try to focus on feasible objectives rather than flights of fancy that simply won’t take off, but sound exciting. Unfortunately, the impetus behind using such tactics is the reality that they often work. As a student body, we need to show them that gimmicks aren’t enough. As with the federal election, candidates need to demonstrate a genuine interest in the lives of their voters rather than trying to stick to a rehearsed platform. That said, however, candidates also need to be well-informed about campus issues and have a well-organized campaign, as these reflect the kind of government we can expect from them.,The AMS executive and rector election period can be a grueling few weeks for candidates. We only hope that they do not lose sight of the reasons they are running and clearly convey these reasons to the rest of the student populace."},{"title":"ASUS must improve accountability","url":"/story/2005-12-01/editorials/asus-must-improve-accountability/","date":"December 1, 2005","content":"The recent ASUS budget debacle has left a torrent of unanswered questions in its wake.

As the individual responsible for the Society’s finances, saying that “you don’t get a big financial picture until the end of the year” is hardly an adequate answer for the loss of such a large amount of money.,This loss is not simply a financial deficit, but an actual loss of money, meaning thousands of dollars are completely unaccounted for. While ArtSci Formal lost an estimated $30,000 due to low attendance, at least specific reasons can be pointed to and improved upon next year. However, there is no explanation as to why or how more than $1,500 was spent on miscellaneous expenditures.,And how do you reconcile the fact that despite a reported record-breaking year of sales expected to make $8,000, ASUS made only $500 from faculty jackets?,Anderson claims he did not know how many jackets were sold, deflecting responsibility to the Jackets Committee. While the committee is not free from blame, it was ultimately Anderson’s responsibility to ensure that ASUS finances were sound. Whether or not he had any direct involvement with the jackets, as vice-president (a position of leadership and authority) Anderson should take responsibility for the oversight rather than deflecting blame.,Such gross errors, however, also point to a systemic problem in the methods ensuring accountability within ASUS. If important financial documents can be “put in random places at any time of the day” and sometimes “slipped under a door,” according to Anderson, it is a clear indication that something needs to change in the organization. Although a budget review committee was established, it met too infrequently to enact any such changes. And while current ASUS Vice-President Lyndsey Hannigan has said that “accountability has increased 10- to 15-fold,” there is no way to measure accountability within such a definitive and quantitative context.,Policy changes to promote accountability, however, are more quantitative. As it stands, within ASUS, the current year’s budget can only be presented once the previous year’s budget has been passed. According to the minutes, the 2004-05 budget passed in September with only two abstentions, and yet only recently have all these discrepancies surfaced. What’s more, there is no incentive for the former Vice-President to actually present a detailed budget because it is so after the fact. A motion was drafted which would have withheld $200 of the Council members’ honoraria until the budget is passed. Although withholding $200 would hardly have been sufficient incentive and the motion was subsequently deemed unconstitutional, it recognizes the necessity for some sort of framework that would ensure accountability.,The information that has surfaced concerning financial inconsistencies emphasizes the need for greater accountability within ASUS. Additionally, individuals involved need to take responsibility for what has happened in order for questions to be answered."},{"title":"Keeping a foot in the past","url":"/story/2005-12-01/editorials/keeping-foot-past/","date":"December 1, 2005","content":"They say most people only really keep in touch with one, maybe two good friends from high school. Growing up is pretty scary if you ask me.,I was reminded of that by an unexpected visit this weekend. A bunch of my high school friends finally came up to Kingston to celebrate one of their birthdays. They said at last they had an excuse to come trekking three hours out of the GTA.,It was great seeing them again, but it made me think about everyone else I missed back home—everyone else I hadn’t seen since high school. You see, I had this vision about how we would all go our separate ways but somehow always have time to meet up and keep in touch—because that’s what friends do. But I guess over time, well, it becomes really, really hard. And even though I probably have 50 of them on my MSN, I probably only know what’s going on with maybe two of these friends half of the time, and sometimes, not even.,So back to my story. We caught up on all the gossip of who’s doing what and where so-and-so has gone. In reminiscing about the past, I felt like I was sitting in a movie: I could see this sudden change from us running home after school to play StarCraft, to eating dinner over a lavish bottle of Dom Perignon, with a simple black screen interlude and caption, “Three years later.” Mind you, despite the fact that this writer still plays StarCraft, (and not to be overdramatic) it was like there was this veil of maturity masking our inner children. We were all still the same, yet different, and after such a short period of time.,It makes me wonder what I’ll be like a few years from now, and who I’ll still be in touch with from Queen’s. How quickly have I forgotten where I came from and who I spent four years with, playing football at lunch hour, and chilling at bubble tea on Friday nights. I can say those were some of the best times I’ve had, because what you really end up missing are the routine things. But it seems like I’m in a different place now and all of that is years long gone. People are always only an e-mail away, but I guess part of what I get stuck on is not knowing what to say. We now live in different worlds. It’s hard to keep in touch with people when you don’t know how to put things into words. After all, how do I describe 40 straight hours of ball hockey, seeing the sunrise from Goodes, or my chronic obsession with A&P chicken?,I guess for now, I just need to get back in touch with some of those who have mattered most. It would be great to try and catch up with what’s going on before it’s too late. I’m not giving up just yet. And besides, the holidays can’t come soon enough because it’s been too long since we’ve all had time to just kick back, relax, and enjoy some good company, if only for a little while longer."},{"title":"Need for sustainability coordinator unclear","url":"/story/2006-01-17/editorials/need-sustainability-coordinator-unclear/","date":"January 17, 2006","content":"At AMS Assembly on Thursday night, John Manning, the AMS Earth Centre Committee Chair, presented a proposal for the creation of an Environmental Sustainability Coordinator. The person hired for the 12-month paid position would “work with service staff, managers, and directors to develop a reporting protocol whereby consumption, waste, and recycling data from services are regularly and accurately recorded and reported,” among other duties.,The establishment of yet another AMS paid position is not the only solution to increasing environmentally friendly practices on campus. The service managers themselves could be mandated to ensure the environmental sustainability of their respective services rather than placing the responsibility upon a single individual. Another possible alternative would be to contract someone for a one-time assessment of the sustainability of the services rather than a year-long, full-time position.,Manning and Social Issues Commissioner Jennifer Holub argued that although there are three groups within the Social Issues Commission concerned with the environment whose goal is to “promote awareness of issues that affect our environment, and promote a lifestyle that is sustainable and responsible,” their resources are limited and insufficient to tackle issues on campus. Rather than putting money into a new position, this money might be better spent infused into these three groups, given their existing expertise, to provide them with the means to advocate for sustainability. However, to ensure that any recommendations or changes suggested by these groups are implemented by the services, consequences should be in place for non-compliance.,The proposal has since been tabled until the next Assembly. Until then, Manning and Holub need to provide more information about environmental sustainability on campus and show that a new coordinator position is truly the best way to move forward."},{"title":"University right to refuse to pay police bill","url":"/story/2006-01-27/editorials/university-right-refuse-pay-police-bill/","date":"January 27, 2006","content":"In a letter dated Jan. 12, Vice-Principal (Academics) Patrick Deane told Kingston Police the University would not pay the $84,000 requested to cover the costs of the increased police presence during the Aberdeen Street party. We commend the University for refusing to yield to the city on an issue for which the institution is quite clearly free of any responsibility. The party on Aberdeen Street was not a University-sanctioned event, and as such, the University is not responsible for the incidents that took place. The University planned its own event as an alternative to students in an attempt to deter them from attending Aberdeen. Well-known bands like Metric and Billy Talent were booked to appeal to more students, which cost the University $200,000.,The Kingston Police are seeking compensation from the University on the basis that Queen’s students were present at the Aberdeen Street party and contributed to the events that ensued. While the actions of some Queen’s students certainly contributed to the chaos, if the police’s logic holds true, they should also be approaching Dalhousie, RMC, and all other universities who had students present on Aberdeen. But they’re not.,In the weeks following Homecoming, there was a lot of emphasis placed on town-gown relations and how students’ behaviour during Homecoming severely compromised these relations. But the request of the Kingston Police has also hurt town-gown relations by reinforcing the “us” and “them” mentality. Other Kingston residents would never be expected to pay extra for police service at a post-bar brawl. The police’s request singles out students as separate from the rest of the community, apparently expecting them to pay double—through taxes and tuition—for a municipal service at an incident most Queen’s students stayed away from. To date, no Queen’s students have been charged with any criminal offences related to Aberdeen.,In a responding letter, Police Chief Bill Closs wrote: “By refusing our reimbursement request and ignoring our sensible proposals for strongly discouraging such activities as occurred on Aberdeen Street in 2005, it can be easily interpreted that Queen’s is passively sanctioning street parties and the resulting behaviour.” But here’s the thing: first of all, requesting $84,000 is in no way “sensible.” Secondly, the University showed is disapproval of the “street parties” and “resulting behaviour” by refusing to sanction such events and even going so far as to offer an alternative event that cost more than double the amount requested by police.,Rather than consistently blaming Queen’s students for the strain on town-gown relations, the police should recognize that they have fuelled it too. Queen’s students do have to shoulder some of the blame for the mayhem, and they will during non-academic disciplinary hearings. But the University is not to blame for what happened at Homecoming, and shouldn’t be footing the bill."},{"title":"SUNY a cloud over Hitchcock & Queen’s","url":"/story/2006-01-13/editorials/suny-cloud-over-hitchcock-and-queens/","date":"January 13, 2006","content":"In December, Principal Hitchcock forwarded to all students a letter that she had sent to the Board of Trustees. This letter was in response to an article published in the Albany Times Union concerning her actions at her previous post at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany. These allegations of unethical conduct, which first surfaced early last year, stemmed from a New York Times article.,In her letter, Hitchcock defended her innocence of any such allegations. She wrote that “at Albany my sole motivation was to seek and secure the best interests of that University” and that “none of the suggestions to the contrary reported in the media has any foundation in fact and a full and impartial inquiry would show that to be so.” In response, the Board of Trustees wrote that it appointed Robert Fiske Jr., a New York lawyer, “authorizing him to take all appropriate steps to assure that a fair and complete inquiry is conducted as expeditiously as possible into the recently repeated and publicized allegations against Dr. Hitchcock.” Shortly before being named principal of Queen’s and after taking leave from her post, Hitchcock was notified that an investigation was underway by the New York State Ethics Commission into her dealings with a developer. Having considered this new information, the University still chose to name Hitchcock to the position. At this time, the University should have conducted its own follow-up investigation rather than waiting it out until another article was published, further tarnishing the Queen’s name and, if found innocent, Principal Hitchcock’s.,At the time, these allegations were linked to anonymous sources and considered baseless because of the ambiguity surrounding the situation. However, in the recent Times Union article, the two top officials at SUNY Albany who raised the allegations were named. Prior to its revision, a loophole in New York State law stated that if an individual is no longer employed by the state, any current investigations immediately cease, which was the case with Hitchcock. The only way to resume the investigation is if it is approved by the Governor. Now, the University is footing the bill to hire a high-profile lawyer to convince the Governor to allow an investigation to be concluded.,This ongoing controversy does not bode well for Queen’s and calls into question its ability to prepare “leaders and citizens for a global society.” For this reason, we feel that the University has taken the appropriate steps in appealing to the Governor, in an attempt to exonerate Hitchcock. In the event that this appeal is denied, however, we would not agree if the University decides to conduct an internal inquiry. Not only would it be costly, but it would also lack the kind of impartial authority the Ethics Commission has.,While the letter appears to be a genuine appeal from Hitchcock for our support, ambiguity continues to cast a shadow over the issue and students are still left with many unanswered questions. It appears that Principal Hitchcock is doing everything in her power to clear her name, and it is unfortunate that she was not given the opportunity to do so due to a loophole that has since been changed. For this reason, we hope that the Governor allows the Ethics Commission to conclude its investigation."},{"title":"Sponsorship scandal should be a lesson learned","url":"/story/2005-11-04/editorials/sponsorship-scandal-should-be-lesson-learned/","date":"November 4, 2005","content":"Mr. Justice John Gomery’s first report about the federal sponsorship scandal was released on Tuesday. In his report, Gomery implicates key members of Jean Chrétien’s government, particularly his Chief of Staff Jean Pelletier, former Public Works Minister Alfonso Gagliano and senior bureaucrat Chuck Guité, who ran the sponsorship program until 1999. Prime Minister Paul Martin, however, escapes the report relatively unscathed.,The year-long investigation found “a complex web of financial transactions among Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), Crown Corporations and communications agencies, involving kickbacks and illegal contributions to a political party in the context of the Sponsorship Program.”,By now, the findings of the Gomery inquiry are not surprising to Canadians. The continued media attention has made it virtually impossible to avoid the controversy. However, familiarity with the issue does not mean Canadians should be apathetic about the gross abuse of power by our elected representatives. If anything, we should voice our disappointment to remind the government whom it is accountable to.,Martin has vowed to hold an election 30 days after the release of Gomery’s final report in February. Until then, we hope the other parties will respect Martin’s promise and allow the regular processes of government to be carried out without the constant threat of a possible election. The sponsorship scandal underlines the growing detachment within a bureaucratic framework. Members of the upper echelons of government, like ministers, are often unaware of the activities of their own offices. Such a separation contributed to the scandal, indicating a need for many ministers to restructure and re-evaluate the organization of their offices.,Ironically and unfortunately, the intention of the program—encouraging the federal government’s visibility in Quebec following the 1995 referendum—has been lost in the shadow of the sponsorship scandal. In light of the tenth anniversary of the referendum, the report highlights the importance of engaging Quebec and points to the failure of the sponsorship program—failure being an understatement. The Gomery report should serve as a wake-up call to the government that Canadians will not stand for abuses of power."},{"title":"50 Cent billboards insult anti-gun activists","url":"/story/2005-11-01/editorials/50-cent-billboards-insult-anti-gun-activists/","date":"November 1, 2005","content":"Paramount recently removed billboard advertisements promoting 50 Cent’s upcoming film, Get Rich or Die Tryin’, in select Los Angeles neighbourhoods amidst community protests. One advertisement shows the artist posing in a crucifixion-like pose with a gun in one hand and a microphone in the other. Another shows 50 Cent with a gun tucked into his pants, carrying a child. When the billboards appeared in neighbourhoods in South Central Los Angeles, activists faulted the studio for its insensitivity. The president of the National Association for Equal Justice in America, a civil rights group, told the L.A. Times the “sign is glorifying a dope dealer and the gang culture.”,While Paramount has the right to post its advertisements in the spaces it has paid for, these community groups have the right to oppose the presence of these billboards in their neighbourhoods. The studio should respect this request, as the community has clearly expressed concern that these billboards will propagate gun violence.,This incident, however, points to a greater issue. We live in a society that idolizes artists who have not only admitted to repeated drug use and dealing, but glamourize gun violence. 50 Cent’s popularity is primarily based on his image as a tough gangster who survived nine gunshot wounds. Children who are exposed to guns and violence are becoming increasingly younger and it isn’t solely because there are more billboards. Gun violence is everywhere: television, movies, magazines, video games. The sad reality is that guns and violence, in some capacity, have become integrated into our everyday lives.,Although the 50 Cent billboards are tasteless, we also realize that billboards are not the cause of the problem. This recent controversy highlights the societal problems indicated by the growing presence of gun violence in the media. It also stresses the importance of a more localized response and involvement in attempting to stop the prevalence of violence."},{"title":"Bush exploits Veterans Day ceremony","url":"/story/2005-11-18/editorials/bush-exploits-veterans-day-ceremony/","date":"November 18, 2005","content":"U.S. President George W. Bush has received considerable criticism following his comments at a Veterans Day ceremony at an army depot in Pennsylvania. Veterans Day is similar to the Canadian Remembrance Day. It is a time for Americans to remember those who represented their country through the military during wartime and peacetime.,Bush’s comments, however, veered away from a remembrance of the individuals who defended their country and were more like a defence of his administration’s decisions about Iraq. A Veterans Day ceremony was hardly the appropriate time or place for these comments.,He called the recent criticism of the U.S. army in Iraq “baseless attacks” that “send the wrong signal to our troops and to an enemy that is questioning America’s will.” He also added: “As our troops fight a ruthless enemy determined to destroy our way of life, they deserve to know that their elected leaders who voted to send them to war continue to stand behind them.” Bush’s argument that the attacks are “baseless” is weak, because evidence continues to come to light about his administration’s attempts to hide information from the American people and propagate half-truths. An example may be found in the alleged actions of White House officials like Lewis Libbey towards CIA agent Valerie Plame, in retaliation for her husband, Joseph Wilson’s op-ed in the New York Times questioning the Bush Administration’s evidence that Iraq was housing weapons of mass destruction. What’s more, it’s conceivable that many Americans wholeheartedly support their troops by questioning the politicians’ decisions to send those troops into dangerous combat zones. Dissent should not be misconstrued as a lack of patriotism.,Bush used this day, a time to remember soldiers past and present, as a platform to launch a campaign in defence of his administration’s actions. As confidence in his government continues to crumble, it is becoming clear to the public that Bush is using any opportunity he can get to defend the choices his government has made, even if it is behind a smokescreen of patriotism."},{"title":"Mirza the wrongful target of fatwa","url":"/story/2005-10-28/editorials/mirza-wrongful-target-fatwa/","date":"October 28, 2005","content":"Rising female tennis player Sania Mirza is the subject of a growing controversy. The 18-year-old, a self-described devout Muslim, has been criticized by some Muslim clerics for her attire on the court. Her polo shirt and tennis skirt are a common and comparatively modest combination in the sport. However, the clerics argue that Mirza is going against the principles of Islam by wearing clothing that fails to cover large areas of her body. The Toronto Star reports that a cleric “the Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Hind in Calcutta issued a fatwa, or edict, before Mirza played there in a tournament last month, saying she would be stopped from participating if she didn’t wear proper clothing.” The controversy, however, has clouded Mirza’s achievements. Ironically, it was her achievements that brought her the publicity that has elicited the outrage against her. Her meteoric rise from 326th to as high as 31st on the world pro tennis circuit is a significant accomplishment. She is also the first Indian woman to reach the fourth round of the U.S. Open, one of the four grand slam events in tennis.,Mirza’s success has made her a role model for young Muslim girls who might otherwise refrain from participating in sports. She has been so much of an inspiration that the board overseeing 285 Islamic schools was prepared to dedicate a chapter of a new textbook to Mirza. This chapter was removed after the board received repeated threats.,Despite the threats, the opposition and the constant fear for her safety, Mirza has persevered and has shown incredible courage. She is not only standing up for her own beliefs and opinions, but she is also paving the way for future female Muslim athletes. She should be commended for her strength in not yielding to the increasing pressures that have been placed upon her.,We disagree with the fatwa issued by the Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Hind. Also, this is not representative of the opinions of all Muslims. In addition to the clerics who have opposed Mirza, there have also been many clerics who have come forward and openly supported her, acknowledging the impracticality and ineffectiveness of wearing long sleeves and and long skirts to play tennis. In an article in the Globe and Mail, a senior Muslim leader said that “those clerics did a mischief by issuing the fatwa against her.” Issuing the fatwa has only perpetuated the image of Islam as a religion that is archaic and oppressive towards women. It is our hope that people realize that the fatwa is not representative of all of Muslims. We also hope that Mirza’s success as both an athlete and a role model are not lost amidst everything else."},{"title":"NSSE better measure of university ‘ranking’","url":"/story/2005-11-11/editorials/nsse-better-measure-university-ranking/","date":"November 11, 2005","content":"This week, Maclean’s released its annual university rankings. Queen’s placed fifth in the medical doctoral category—the same as last year—which, according to the magazine, includes schools that “have a broad range of Ph.D. programs and research, as well as medical schools.” Most surprising and disappointing was the University’s fall from third to seventh-place in overall ranking in the national reputational category, as decided by CEOs, corporate recruiters, and guidance counselors. This information is alarming because it shows that potential employers and prospective students alike are no longer looking as highly upon Queen’s, a school that prides itself on its reputation.,The Maclean’s rankings are not, however, a completely accurate representation of Canadian universities, given the categories that have been defined and the schools that have been chosen for each category.,The Maclean’s survey is also not the most important survey in which Queen’s takes part. The McGuinty government has announced that it will distribute “results-based” funding to post-secondary institutions. In light of this announcement, all Canadian schools will participate in the National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE), whose results could influence the government’s decisions about who gets what funding.,The 42 questions that make up the NSSE include questions that focus specifically on a student’s engagement with not only the faculty, but also with peers and the overall campus environment. In 2004, Queen’s ranked the highest out of the eight Canadian universities that participated, including U of T and McGill.,While surveys are not perfectly representative of what students think of their schools, they can at least help identify issues that need to be resolved. The University’s Maclean’s ranking for reputation is surprising and needs to be improved upon, as this is one of the critical indications of what prospective students and employers will think of graduates of Queen’s. But before the University engages the world, it would be wise to ensure that its current students are engaged—if not for the students’ sake, at least for the upcoming NSSE 2006."},{"title":"Pro patria mori–neither sweet nor proper","url":"/story/2005-11-11/editorials/pro-patria-morineither-sweet-nor-proper/","date":"November 11, 2005","content":"As most sentient beings have probably been able to judge from the ubiquitous poppies, Remembrance Day is upon us once again. This day has always struck me as special; the solemnity of elementary school assemblies and the yearly recitations of Wilfred Owen’s wartime poem “Dulce Et Decorum Est,” which never failed to give me the shivers, convinced me that this was a day to be taken seriously. And I continue to believe that wholeheartedly. Remembrance of wars past is imperative for all those who have ever been affected by warfare, i.e., everyone on earth.,But one aspect of Remembrance Day that sometimes scares me is the fine line between expressing gratitude towards those who have fought for their country, and the glorification of that fight. If there is one thing that human society should have learned by now, it is that war is—how shall I put this?—bad. Really bad, in every possible way. Anything that reduces people to killing machines can never be just. I think that the act of killing another human being, who is probably fighting for similar reasons and has no less right to life than anyone else, is one of the most dehumanizing things a person can do. Far too often, war is seen as a viable option for problem-solving, rather than an absolute last resort.,This is not to suggest that war should never be waged. There are occasions when outright warfare is necessary from a humanitarian perspective. I would use the Second World War as an example of this, although to be perfectly honest, I think that the escalation of events in the late 1930s was a frightening example of the utter failure of international intervention to prevent a political and humanitarian crisis that necessitated a full-scale war. The lives of those who died during that war and during the Holocaust that accompanied it are on the world’s collective conscience. Today, international organizations such as the UN are ostensibly more effective than the League of Nations at diffusing global conflict, yet entirely unnecessary, tragic warfare has not been stopped. If anything, violence has increased, both in scope and degree. Almost all this bloodshed can be attributed, whether directly or indirectly, to the world’s most wealthy, powerful, and stable nations: the ones that should,be doing the most to stop it. Violence in Africa, South America and the Middle East is in large part the result of instability caused by centuries of the subordination of colonialism.,We, as so-called ‘first world nations,’ are guilty of supplying arms and exacerbating conflict where it serves our interests. Granted, Canada has not been doing much of this since it supplied the United States with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. However, no matter how much we tout ourselves as peacekeepers, we have done very little in terms of the actual prevention of war. During Remembrance Day ceremonies around the world, Owen’s chilling and powerful poem will be read aloud. But the message of this poem, its outright condemnation of war, has yet to be taken to heart. It is time for the global community to wake up and realize that war is anything but glorious, and that we need to negate once and for all the old lie: dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."},{"title":"The beauty of the ongoing now","url":"/story/2005-11-18/editorials/beauty-ongoing-now/","date":"November 18, 2005","content":"Looking around at the faces on campus, I’ve noticed a general aura of weariness that is strikingly common at this time of the year. Students adopt a certain zombie-esque quality, going through the day mechanically, with too many wishful thoughts about the upcoming holidays. As Emerson succinctly put it, “we are always getting ready to live, but never living.”,There is a strong tendency amongst us all to play psychic with our future, as seen in the frantic questions of “What are your plans for this Christmas?” “What are your plans for this summer?” “What are you planning on doing next year?” And God forbid if you give any sign of uncertainty—apparently, everybody else can prophesize their future plans with ease. But a shrug and a vague mumble of “I dunno” or “not much” is probably the answer you might get if you utter the rare question: “what are your plans right now?” When did today become so obsolete? Where does this hunger for tomorrow come from, why do we feel the need to map out our future, and why is it that the present is a subject only discussed in poetry?,Carpe diem (a highly over-quoted phrase meaning “seize the day”) was a theme Renaissance poets would often incorporate in their work in order to woo the women of their dreams. Time is quickly sifting down to the bottom of the hourglass, along with the ever-fleeting beauty and the ephemeral body. So one might as well just live and love before the “quaint honour turn into dust / And into ashes all my lust,” as Marvell would muse to win his coy mistress.,Maybe what we all need is another sleazy poet to remind us that time is indeed a precious concept. Here we are, in the prime of our youth, with glorious independence and insatiable energy. But instead of cherishing the golden days of being a student, we are frantically writing down deadlines for that next assignment, planning the next meeting on our cell phone, printing out yet another resume for yet another application. Living inside a school system that continually harps on the “options” of our so-called future has placed us in the world of tomorrows and laters.,But tomorrow won’t, and can’t, exist without today. Life is too short to be lived through an overactive imagination and wishful thinking. The wonderful visions of the future will never receive the full appreciation they deserve if we don’t learn to embrace this very moment.,Too often, we sigh away the days as the doom of tomorrow looms over our heads—and moments become a meaningless bridge leading into the mirage of the elusive “late.” But maybe, getting adequately lost in the radical, unconditional “now” that philosophers have idealized wouldn’t be so bad—even if it’s just for a split second to let the overwhelming sensation of your busy life actually take hold for once.,One of my favourite movies of all time, Waking Life, has a quote outlining the beauty of the present: “the ongoing ‘wow’ is happening right now.” Breathtaking discoveries, spontaneous joy, artful creation—somewhere, somebody is making this moment into an extraordinary miracle.,And you, too, can do the same."},{"title":"‘In the cold November rain’","url":"/story/2005-11-04/editorials/cold-november-rain/","date":"November 4, 2005","content":"November is a cunning and cruel month. Riding on the popularity of October’s home-cooked meals, falling leaves, and suggestive costume choices, November quietly creeps in and begins its oppressive 30-day reign over our lives. We are driven to despair by November’s gloom and are left crying out for December to come and rescue us with all its festive joy.,Sure, the last few days have been beautiful. So far November seems to be as harmless as a gentle breeze rustling through a weeping willow, beside a babbling creek with little baby bunnies chewing on soft, green grass. How can we complain?,Friends, don’t be fooled—November is trying to trick you. Pretty soon the days will grow grey and cold. The weather will turn on us. Those bunnies will be shot by the farmer, who will chop down that weeping willow and use it as firewood to boil the water from the creek, so he can cook rabbit stew for dinner—strictly metaphorically speaking. The gentle breeze will turn into the harsh, abrupt howl of November.,For the past two months I have been at peace—calm and refreshed. No major assignments, lots of irresponsible spending, naps at Stauffer—the way university life is supposed to be. But then ... cruel November returns.,Suddenly my rent cheque bounces, and I realize that my Carmen Electra Stripaerobics DVD box set was actually not a justifiable purchase after all—not to mention that it has done nothing for my thighs.,This month I have already received two parking tickets—it’s only Nov. 4. And these haven’t been the nice “$10 if paid early, because we know you’re a decent struggling student” tickets. Oh, no. These have been the “real deal $30/send a letter to your angry parents because we just don’t like you” tickets. Stupid November.,I have four essays, one mid-term, and one presentation all due in the next four weeks. Apparently I was supposed to be “responsible” and not “procrastinate”—I wasn’t, and I did. Each of these assignments are absolutely critical to my final grades—which, if Queen’s has taught me anything, are imperative to my finding any sort of future meaning and value in my life.,I can’t stay awake in any of my classes—November has rendered me lifeless. Every lecture, my head falls forward as I slip into an unconscious state, and I abruptly wake to an embarrassing pool of drool soaking through my chicken scratch doodles.,But I am a very experienced November pessimist, and I’ve found a way to defeat my annual nemesis. After much study and research, I conclude that all of the stress, poverty, fatigue, and general gloom that November carries with it can be solved with a simple—albeit twisted—sacrifice. If you hate November as much as I do, get the flu. Trust me.,You’re not just limited to the flu—mono works nicely—as long as it’s a temporary illness that other people do not want to get. However, apparently it’s “flu season” so it may be convenient to work with what’s popular.,Last November I had mono and was excused from class for a week and a half, while receiving extensions on all of my assignments. Meanwhile I sucked cherry Jell-O through a straw while lounging around my parents’ house in a terry cloth bathrobe, catching up with the crazy antics of Archie, Jughead and the gang from Riverdale.

When I first set foot on campus soil over two years ago, I couldn’t dance to save my life. It was only natural, then, that attending the first-year orientation dance gripped me with a fear matched only by presenting my parents with a substandard report card in middle school.,However, a new friend in my frosh group taught me how not to look like a gyrating stick man, and slowly encouraged my clumsy flailing on the dance floor. I’m happy to say I can look back on that night without unpleasant memories, but I was also relieved that I didn’t have to be placed in such a perilous situation again. At least, that’s what I thought.,A week later, I went to athletics night with that same friend, and we happened to pass by the breakdancing booth. There were three or four dancers there who were clearly cooler looking than I could ever hope to be. One turned to me with a welcoming grin and said, “Join up, man!” My friend urged me on, saying, “If I can try out for cheerleading, you can try breakdancing!” I picked up the pen and signed my name. I had no idea what I had gotten myself into.,I walked into my first class expecting nothing but humiliation and physical pain. What I got instead was a taste of my newest addiction. Like some twisted Petrarchan irony, I was drawn to this new pleasurable pain that was “breaking.” I tripped over my feet toprocking, and I loved it. I killed my wrist practicing the most basic freezes, but I kept trying. While doing the six-step, I tangled my legs like an incompetent contortionist, but I’d untangle them and start over.,Never before had I been so inept at something, but at the same time such a thing was never so intoxicating. I would practice in the stairway on my residence floor, without any music: an object of curiosity for passersby. I started listening to more hip-hop: the good stuff, like Rakim, The Sugar Hill Gang and Grandmaster Flash. I downloaded videos of b-boys and watched in awe, the talent of these dedicated dancers. It was only adding fuel to the fire. I wanted to become good. No, more than that: I wanted to become great.,Earlier this year I bumped into my frosh friend who had encouraged me so long ago. I threw down a routine at the sidewalk sale as she watched. “You’ve gotten a lot better,” she said with a smile. I honestly couldn’t agree more.,Now at clubs and semi-formals I fearlessly unleash everything I had learned. Not only that, but I enjoy it to no end. I dance for myself, and that’s the best part. For me, breakdancing isn’t a gimmick; I live for the dance. I’m not the best out there, not even close. But I realized that being the best wasn’t the important part.,Seasons will change and loves will come and go. But living in that fraction of time when all eyes are on you and that one perfect song is playing? Eternal, and damn priceless."},{"title":"Wiretap bill a needless invasion of privacy","url":"/story/2005-11-18/editorials/wiretap-bill-needless-invasion-privacy/","date":"November 18, 2005","content":"On Tuesday, the Liberals introduced Bill C-74, whose short title is the “Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act.” According to the government, C-74 is an “act regulating telecommunications facilities to facilitate the lawful interception of information transmitted by means of those facilities and respecting the provisions of telecommunications subscriber information.”,Beyond all this technical jargon, the bill will essentially allow agencies like the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the police to access personal information like addresses, phone numbers, and even IP addresses upon request of Internet and phone providers. If this bill is passed, it could potentially hurt all personal rights to privacy, adding to a looming surveillance state where no amount of information can remain outside the public sphere.,Given CSIS’s track record, it is hardly unreasonable that concern has been raised. In September, Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew apologized for the way CSIS sullied the reputation of Bhupinder Singh Liddar, a well-known presence on Parliament Hill. Liddar was appointed by Prime Minister Chrétien as consul general to Punjab, India in October 2003, only to be removed from the post in January 2004. According to CTV, a report by Paule Gautier, the former chairwoman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, Liddar “was denied a consular appointment to India because of a hasty, slipshod assessment by a rookie CSIS investigator.” There have been suggestions that the cancellation of Liddar’s appointment was driven by shifts in political power. And while the act limits power to CSIS and police officials, we are not confident in the discretion of these officials to use this power only in particularly urgent matters. The possibility an individual could be targeted simply because he or she might fit a terrorist profile for example, is a risk few of us are willing to take in the name of public safety. The policy director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association told the Toronto Star that “the point here is, if the police can’t be troubled with getting a warrant, it’s because they haven’t met the standard of reasonable and probable grounds to access the warrant.” If this bill is passed, it could potentially mean that rather than being innocent until proven guilty, an individual is automatically assumed guilty until proven innocent.,The events of Sept. 11 and the subsequent terrorist attacks have created an atmosphere of fear that has only been perpetuated by agencies like CSIS, focused on uncovering the next possible terrorist act. The fact remains that the people with the capabilities to carry out terrorist attacks are also those most capable of evading the kind of surveillance C-74 will grant police and CSIS, leaving normal, everyday Canadians with the feeling that Big Brother is watching them."},{"title":"Smith has right to privacy from teammates","url":"/story/2005-11-04/editorials/smith-has-right-privacy-teammates/","date":"November 4, 2005","content":"Saskatchewan Roughriders middle linebacker Trevis Smith has been arrested for aggravated assault after a woman alleged that Smith had unprotected sex with her and did not disclose his HIV-positive status. The arrest comes after the RCMP revealed to the public Smith’s HIV status in order to warn women Smith might have encountered and to encourage them to come forward and get tested. According to the Globe and Mail, Smith “is charged with aggravated sexual assault under section 273, sub. 2 of the Criminal Code. That subsection includes the charge of self-induced intoxication, recklessness or willful blindness or not taking reasonable steps to ensure the complainant was consenting.”,The team officials were made aware of Smith’s condition a year ago when Regina police informed them that charges might be laid. It was the RCMP that made the recent arrest. According to Roughriders Chairman Graham Barker, after evaluating the situation, the team chose not to disclose this information to the players. If the allegations against Smith are true, his actions were indeed reckless and he should have told the woman he was involved with that he is HIV-positive. However, in his relationship with his teammates, Smith has the right to privacy and it should be his decision whether or not to tell them.,The reactions of some players to Smith’s HIV-positive status also show the continued stigma that accompanies HIV and AIDS. Despite the very remote possibility of the players contracting HIV from playing with Smith (estimated at about one in 85 million), their fear suggests a lack of knowledge as to the true nature of the virus and its ability to infect. Reactions to HIV and AIDS demonstrate a certain degree of ignorance in both the players and the public. An initiative needs to be undertaken to inform not only athletes but also the public about HIV and AIDS.,Trevis Smith should have informed his partners of the fact that he is HIV-positive before engaging in unprotected sex. However, he was under no obligation to inform his teammates about his condition. This controversy indicates the need for some kind of education to be provided to athletes and spectators so they can better understand the true implications of HIV and AIDS rather than perpetuating common misconceptions."},{"title":"Khadr to face commission, not courts","url":"/story/2005-11-11/editorials/khadr-face-commission-not-courts/","date":"November 11, 2005","content":"After 39 months at Guantánamo Bay, Omar Ahmed Khadr, a 19 year-old Canadian citizen, was charged this week with murder and attempted murder in addition to charges for aiding the enemy. In 2002, Khadr—just 15 years old at the time—was the sole survivor of a U.S. raid on an Al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan and is accused of throwing the grenade that killed U.S. medic Sgt. Christopher Speer and injured Sgt. 1st Class Layne Morris.,Although details are still unclear as to what happened in Afghanistan, Khadr will face a military commission. What’s more, the U.S. government has identified Khadr as an “unprivileged belligerent,” which means he does not fall under Geneva Conventions. Khadr will be tried under the U.S. military commission, rather than in the regular court system. The constitutionality of these commissions is under fire in the US.. The commission allows testimony to be heard without the presence of the defence’s lawyer and the jury is made up of military officers. This will greatly reduce the likelihood of Khadr receiving a fair trial, which is a fundamental right of each individual under international law—a right arguably upheld most adamantly by the U.S..,While the U.S. has decided not to pursue the death penalty, the Canadian government is still pressing the U.S. to grant Khadr access to Canadian lawyers and to representation during the tribunal.,Reports about the torture of prisoners and substandard conditions at Guantánamo Bay are not new. The U.S. military has essentially created its own black hole where inmates are beyond American law. While Bush has stood by his war using human rights violations—among other things—to justify his controversial decision, he too has committed various human rights violations. Amnesty International said, “Hypocrisy, an overarching war mentality and a disregard for basic human rights principles and international legal obligations continue to mark the USA’s ‘war on terror.’ ”,It is important that as an international community, Canada and other countries stand up for Khadr’s right to a fair trial, just as any of us would expect to be given by our own government. As individuals, we must also make our own personal efforts to make politicians hear our voices, whether that means e-mailing or sending letters to show the U.S. government that its treatment of prisoners is unacceptable."},{"title":"Signs should not be city’s priority","url":"/story/2005-10-28/editorials/signs-should-not-be-citys-priority/","date":"October 28, 2005","content":"This week students learned that signs with slogans affixed to houses are considered graffiti by city inspectors, even if the homeowners put the signs up themselves.,One of the first students to get a rude awakening to this silly definition of “graffiti” was Jon Taylor, whose house at 262 Earl St. bears a sign that reads “The Lodge”—for now. Taylor’s house has been ordered to remove the sign as part of a campaign by the city to better enforce property standards in the Ghetto. So does this mean all Kingstonians who have signs on their homes should start worrying? Should Kingston residents who proudly display wooden nameplates like “The Smiths” on their homes get their screwdrivers out?,Common sense says no, because signs are not graffiti. For the same reason suburban residents may rightly decide to adorn their homes with signs like “The Smiths” or other decorations, students in the Ghetto choose to put their own unique stamp on their homes. Signs can be expressions of individuality and,sometimes reflect the sense of humour of the occupants.,The presence of signs on a house has no bearing on the quality of housing, or on pressing issues like leaky basements, mould or broken doors and windows. These should be the issues city inspectors focus on, but instead they seem to be hung up on signs. And those that are supposed to represent and advocate for students have decided not to call the city on how they are dodging serious housing issues by focusing on minor esthetics.,“I think students need to be careful what they wish for,” said Town-Gown co-ordinator Joan Jones.,“I would be hesitant to think they would be targeting students,” said AMS Municipal Affairs Commissioner Naomi Lutes.,The attitude of the city when it comes to enforcement of this property standard bylaw is silly. It’s the absolute wrong way to go about improving relations and conditions between students and the city. The city needs to deal with the most pressing issues first (broken doors and windows, for example) before the trivial details."},{"title":"Kashechewan crisis points to larger issues","url":"/story/2005-11-01/editorials/kashechewan-crisis-points-larger-issues/","date":"November 1, 2005","content":"More than two weeks after E. coli was detected in the water of the Kashechewan First Nations reserve, hundreds are still awaiting evacuation. A report published in 2003 by the Ontario Clean Water Agency referred to Kashechewan as a “Walkerton-in-waiting.” For two years, the community has been under a boil-water advisory. It seems there was sufficient evidence for government officials to at least prepare for a possible outbreak on the reserve.,The situation in Kashechewan, however, is not isolated to this community alone. 85 other First Nation communities across Canada are under boil-water advisories. Indian Affairs Minister Andy Scott has recently suggested the lack of training of the water purification plant operators is to blame.,The Globe and Mail reports that Scott’s press secretary, Campbell Morrison, has said that “we don’t think all first nations have certified water experts .... Part of that is to train people to run all these water facilities and for the training and certification operators.” In addition, $1.6 billion has been set aside to train these individuals. However, the issue here is that none of these measures were taken when the problem was still in its preventative stages. Officials have waited until now, when lives are at risk, to begin attempting to solve the problem.,Canada has consistently faced deserved criticism for its treatment of native peoples within its borders. After many suggestions and warnings from the UN, Canada—a country that ranked first in the UN Human Development Index for years—was finally sent a message when it fell to fifth place. If this issue isn’t new, then why hasn’t anything been done?,It is disappointing that even after the Walkerton tragedy, this situation in Kashechewan was still allowed to happen. It has also shed some light on an even greater issue at hand: the government-implemented infrastructure of the Kashechewan and other First Nation communities needs to be re-evaluated. From the very beginning, when the reserve was first built, its location was questioned because its situation on low-lying land makes it susceptible to flooding.,Despite the apprehension, the reserve was still built. Now, 50 years later, it is moving to a location it could quite easily have been built on from the start. In the Globe and Mail, one resident put it aptly, saying: “This place is not good enough. It never has been. They should burn it to the ground.” While the crisis should never have happened in the first place, we hope the increased public attention will encourage both sides to open lines of communication and dialogue in order to ensure that water impurities do not claim the lives of residents of the Kashechewan First Nation reserve like they did in Walkerton.

I was heading to Toronto on a road trip, and although most of my fellow Queen’s students in the car felt at home when we got there, the passing countryside is more familiar for me. The car ride reminded me of the day my class voted that having multiple new vehicles in the driveway was—shrug—fairly normal, and half of them admitted they cruised around in their own leased little numbers.,The driveways in my hometown would have voted quite differently. My family’s gravel strip is home to one broken down old Mercury and a 1990 GMC pickup with the “C” missing from the rusted tailgate held together by a rope. We bought it second-hand from a farm down the road, and for the first few trips, it still smelled strongly of cow. Although there have been times at Queen’s when I’ve felt out of place, there have also been many other times when the Q shoe has fit.,At home, however, I always belong. Here’s my shout out to rural Ontario. I came to Kingston ready to experience conversation beyond lazy comments about town meetings, crops, country politics and rural boredom. Daily dialogue with my neighbours (“what do you want to do?” “I don’t know, what do you want to do?”) was beginning to get tiresome when the answer was always, “nothing.”,But these days, somewhere between Stauffer kids and Career Services, I find myself looking up at the stars and wishing I could see the neighbours now. I miss working on the wooden docks of the lake at home and the creaking sound they make when you walk to the end. I love the feeling of being outside and doing anything you want ’cause there’s no one around to watch you. I like the way the sun feels on the back deck and the way it sets in explosive colours behind the barn across the street in the summertime. I don’t mind that the mall takes a half-hour drive on the 400-series highway. I don’t really care about Gucci and Louis and what those guys are up to, and I love the fact that, at home, nobody around me does either. On a morning run I could wave at three people and pass only one car, and although we didn’t learn about handbags, high heels and personalized licence plates, we learned to love the big yellow school bus at six in the morning, how warm flannel is, and how to plan hangouts well in advance to allow for transportation time. I learned in the winter to replace a mailbox after the snowplow eats it and in the summer to remove robins’ nests from inside it or your mail will be withheld. While I’m still hating and loving Queen’s, I’m done with hating on the country. “The best things around that I have ever seen, came from small towns and big dreams.” Word up, Paul Brandt."},{"title":"Hazing incidents taken to an extreme","url":"/story/2005-10-25/editorials/hazing-incidents-taken-extreme/","date":"October 25, 2005","content":"McGill University has chosen to cancel the remainder of its football season early after an investigation into its Aug. 27 rookie night revealed that allegations of hazing made by a player were true. The player has subsequently left the team and the university.,The CBC also recently reported that the general manager and head coach of the OHL’s Windsor Spitfires, Moe Mantha, has been slapped with a one-year suspension as general manager and a 25-game suspension as coach for reports of hazing that involved team members stripping down and crowding into the bathroom at the back of the team bus.,While initiation rituals may forge close relationships between players and encourage a sense of camaraderie, they can also create an atmosphere tinged with the threat of ostracism and isolation. At no time should any individual feel pressured into doing something he or she is uncomfortable with, and neither should he or she worry about the repercussions for refusing to participate.,The responsibility for establishing such a non-coercive and safe environment falls on people in positions of authority, like coaches and team captains. Mantha has in fact come forward and taken responsibility for the actions of his players, which is commendable. Coaches who are aware of hazing events should warn players against taking it too far and establish a team culture that discourages degrading rituals. However, coaches are only able to enforce so much. Ultimately, players are most capable of influencing the actions and behaviour of their fellow teammates.,The media attention over these two isolated cases of initiation gone awry has reflected poorly on sports rookie nights in general. However, hazing is not limited to sports teams and it is unfortunate that incidents involving athletes received most of the attention. On many teams it is possible for athletes to refuse to participate without fear of ostracism. In order for rookie nights to be positive experiences that create close-knit teams, players must be made aware by coaches and team captains that each individual has the inherent right to say “no.”"},{"title":"Losing touch with InTouch","url":"/story/2005-10-21/editorials/losing-touch-intouch/","date":"October 21, 2005","content":"It’s time to come clean about my rehabilitation from an embarrassing addiction to weekly celebrity gossip magazines. I know it will generate a lot of eye rolling and groans, but recent events have caused me to evaluate my problem. I started reading my mother’s copies of Vogue when I was about 14.,When my knowledge of the fashion industry exceeded that of my peer group, I decided to start reading something more age appropriate. At the time, teen magazines were wonderful. Colourful and glossy, they contained the perfect amount of beauty, fashion and celebrity chit-chat.,As I got older, I moved onward to bigger and brighter publications. But chit-chat soon became too tame and I wanted scandal. There was a void that was forming, and it could only be filled by the celebrity machine.,In recent years, there has been a great deal of time and money spent on the fascination and goings-on of celebrities.,Us Weekly, the crème de la crème of celebrity news, contains a very successful section called “Stars—They’re Just Like Us!” which features photographs of celebrities walking their dogs, getting parking tickets, and diving into pools, along with everything else that regular humans do. But still, regular people are left remarking in some disbelief, “Wow, Jessica Alba actually walks her own dog!” And I used to count myself among them.,In the prime of my obsession, I was reading Us Weekly religiously, and if that wasn’t enough to satisfy me, I would stoop to buying the less-accurate and more-scandalous gossip rags like Star or InTouch. And this made my devout Us Weekly friends frown.,This September, I went to the Toronto International Film Festival and coincidentally selected some films with big celebrities as their headliners. Because filmgoers are herded into the theatres prior to the A-listers, I didn’t get a chance to witness them on the red carpet. However, I did see them when they finally made it inside. It was during these moments when stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Jason Schwartzman, Julianne Moore and Claire Danes would attempt to make their way to their seats that I realized how much we regular people felt entitled to something from them. Without saying a thing, people would approach them with cameras and get snap happy. The celebrities appeared to look through the crowd, smiling at some distant object. I started to feel incredibly embarrassed and found myself sinking lower into my seat. After my fifth film where a similar occurrence had taken place, I was so mortified I wasn’t even looking up from my book. Over the course of the festival, I witnessed first-hand the ugly side of celebrity. The stars became walking photo ops who seemed to owe us something. And the thing is, they don’t owe us anything. I decided then and there I didn’t want to fuel this machine anymore. I want to celebrate what they do, not how well they parallel park their cars.,This is why I’ve decided to put down the gossip magazines. I now walk a bit faster by that rack in drug marts and grocery stores. And I don’t even mind, because the news is always the same. Unless, of course, Jessica and Nick are on the cover. I always succumb to that one."},{"title":"The bittersweet return of hockey","url":"/story/2005-10-21/editorials/bittersweet-return-hockey/","date":"October 21, 2005","content":"The celebrated return of the NHL has been a bittersweet occasion for diehard fans. After an entire season without hockey, spectators are soaking up every minute of play they possibly can. The game, however, has not returned from its hiatus quite the same. The new rules arguably have not resulted in a positive change in the sport.,The greatest issue of contention is the rule that has removed the possibility of a tie from regular season play. Shootouts are deciding many games, eliminating the team aspect of hockey. Intelligent defence and good puck handling don’t matter when what it all comes down to is a shootout. This new regulation awards an additional point to the team that wins a shootout. What could very well end up happening is that less successful teams could get one of the coveted playoff spots merely based on a high shootout record, undermining the quality of a team’s overall performance.,Another rule that hurts the game is the introduction of the trapezoid area behind the net. This limits the goalie’s ability to make the amazing plays that added to the excitement of the former NHL. We won’t get to see the incredible skill these goalies have outside of protecting the net and blocking shots.,An improvement, however, is the elimination of the red line. It will open up the ice more, which will allow for more offensive play and discourage them from using the trap for defence. As for the increasing number of penalties, hopefully players will adjust to the new rules and things will level off.,Although it was necessary for the NHL to make these changes in order to be sustainable and draw crowds, it seems the league has sacrificed a part of what made devoted fans continue to watch. It is an unfortunate commentary on the sport that commercialism has dictated these new changes—this need for more speed, more goals, more immediate action. And the saddest part is that these changes have been made to attract an audience that may not be as dedicated to the sport, while diehard fans are forced to accept these changes and mourn the loss of the hockey they once knew."},{"title":"Tasers & tear gas are not the solution","url":"/story/2005-10-25/editorials/tasers-and-tear-gas-are-not-solution/","date":"October 25, 2005","content":"The Kingston Police recently sent a letter requesting the University pay $84,000 for the expenses they incurred in order to police the Ghetto during Homecoming. In a second letter, the police suggested that the University have automatic punishment in place for students who violate the Criminal code.,They have also anticipated new strategies for next year, which may include helmets, Tasers and tear gas. In addition, the newly established City Council-approved Committee to Restore Order will soon begin trying to uncover the causes of the events of Homecoming in an attempt to prevent a violent recurrence.,The new committee’s name alone perpetuates an escalation in attitude. It’s no coincidence that as police action on Aberdeen escalates, so does the violence. Nevertheless, the findings of the committee will hopefully shed more light onto what went wrong and what needs to be done.,In an earlier editorial, the Journal did suggest a greater police presence at the Aberdeen Street party—however, Tasers were not the first things to come to mind in terms of possible strategies. While helmets would protect officers from flying beer bottles, Tasers seem an extreme measure. Before resorting to such tactics, the police should first assess how well their strategies for Abderdeen this year worked. There are other strategies the police can try before resorting to violence involving Tasers. Many officers were situated on either side of Aberdeen, containing the crowd within the street, but failed to venture onto Aberdeen and attempt to actually control the crowd. For the police to call for more discipline in addition to the legal consequences that accompany the Criminal Code points to an inadequacy in their own system. The process of non-academic discipline should continue to supplement the Criminal Code. Its due process should not be bypassed simply because the police don’t think punishments under the Criminal Code are sufficient.,Ultimately, students, are responsible for their actions. The University is not. The University was in no way involved with Aberdeen and should not be made to pay the $84,000. In fact, the University made good efforts to deter students from partying on Aberdeen, which included organizing the concert in Miller parking lot. If the police want to develop effective strategies, the first place they should look is to students. There have been few efforts made by the police to truly engage students in developing an effective police strategy.,We encourage students to share their opinions and possible solutions as to what should happen with Homecoming. This could mean dropping off a submission to the Journal’s essay contest before Oct. 31, or simply attending the various symposiums being held to address Aberdeen."},{"title":"A different kind of sports medicine","url":"/story/2005-10-28/editorials/different-kind-sports-medicine/","date":"October 28, 2005","content":"I’ve done a lot of dumb things in the name of sport. Two nights ago, I added mild hypothermia to the list.,I ran a hard track workout with the Queen’s ski team and didn’t bother changing into dry clothes for the chilly walk home. I walked in the door, threw off my tights and long underwear and hopped into a hot shower. It must have triggered some weird biochemical response, because as soon as I left the shower, I started shivering so uncontrollably that within minutes I was huddled in bed in a sweatshirt and three blankets.,It took me an hour to warm up enough to hold tea without spilling it. Then I felt so brain-dead I just had to watch TV for another hour. So much for my plan to devote that evening to course readings.,It might be foolhardy of me to be on the ski team at all this year. I gave up coaching it in favour of running this newspaper, which eats time the way overtrained marathon runners eat pasta—particularly now that we’re working hard to raise our student fee.,I’m a full-time student with a full-time job, yet I can’t seem to tear myself away from the student-athlete life, whatever demands it may place on my body, mind or schedule.,Luckily, the physiology research out there suggests I’m not as crazy as I thought. Instead of being dumb, the athletic streak that drives me to hypothermia may actually produce some kind of intelligence.,In middle school my classmates and I were always told playing sports would improve our time management skills and motivate us to work effectively, thus making us better students.,Apparently, though, it goes deeper than that. According to Psychology Today, athletes have denser networks of brain cells than sedentary people, which actually makes it easier to for them to process information. An exercise-triggered protein called BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) appears to be responsible.,Studies on rats found the ones with elevated levels of the protein were better able to complete mazes, while research on human adults found active people were better at organizing tasks and paying attention.,I don’t know about the “paying attention” part. But I’m hoping the “processing information” part means that if I do all the readings for my Friday 8:30 and try to absorb the lectures between bouts of napping, the fact that I didn’t actually study for the mid-term won’t be reflected in my mark. Probably wishful thinking, I know.,Nonetheless, student-athletes like me may be just the right kind of chemical freaks. It confirms what I’ve always known: that I can’t function properly if I can’t get outside and play most days of the week. I suspect it’s that way for a lot of Queen’s athletes, many of whom are currently gearing up for OUA championships amid piles of mid-terms but just wouldn’t have things any other way. Fortunately, it looks like rather than sabotaging our academic careers, we’re actually doing ourselves a favour by hauling ourselves to practice every day.,So I’ll lace up my shoes and get back out training and campaigning, hoping that when I do sit down to slog through my course readers, it’ll go as fast as I’m hoping to ski this winter."},{"title":"Aberdeen reaffirms JComm’s powers","url":"/story/2005-09-30/editorials/aberdeen-reaffirms-jcomms-powers/","date":"September 30, 2005","content":"An emergency AMS Assembly meeting was convened Tuesday night to discuss the events on Aberdeen street during Homecoming weekend. Unanimously, assembly members voted in favour of maintaining the AMS Judicial Committee (JComm), a student-run, non-academic discipline system. It is a complaints-based system whereby any member of the community—police, Kingston residents or students—can file a complaint, which will then be reviewed by the AMS Prosecutor’s Office. If there is sufficient basis for the complaint, the office will either settle on a method of discipline with the offender, or bring the case before JComm so its panel can decide on what discipline is warranted. An important part of the AMS’s mandate is to protect the interests of the students whereas the University must consider many other issues and faces pressures that might interfere with its ability to protect the rights and interests of students. Students are better able to understand student issues and keep student rights in mind while making their decisions. Discipline by peers may also prove to be more effective than any discipline from the Administration because it comes from peers and not from a distant figurehead.,The process of students disciplining other students may also show the Kingston community that the actions of a select group of students on Aberdeen last weekend are unacceptable to the rest of the student body. It is imperative that the Prosecutor’s Office thoroughly investigate the cases it receives. The community expects these individuals to be held accountable for their actions, and the Prosecutor’s Office and JComm must assess these actions and decide accordingly.,The actions of students on Aberdeen were shameful and are not representative of the students at Queen’s. We call upon our student-run judicial system to assess and consider the actions of these individuals and make fair and unbiased rulings. At the same time, we hope members of the community see this not as merely a front for discipline but a genuine expression of disappointment in their peers on the part of the students at Queen’s."},{"title":"Energy drink raises concerns","url":"/story/2005-09-20/editorials/energy-drink-raises-concerns/","date":"September 20, 2005","content":"Mountain Dew’s energy drink is a new addition to the slew of other caffeinated beverages that are now available in Canada.

In comparison, a cup of brewed coffee contains 135 milligrams of caffeine while a cup of tea has 43 milligrams.,The article reported the high levels of caffeine in these energy drinks “cause children to be distracted and unable to concentrate, and interfere with their sleep.” As a diuretic and stimulant, caffeine causes headaches, irritability, depression and nervousness.

These sports drinks also provide sugars, which the body burns to create energy and replenish electrolytes. Electrolytes maintain salt and potassium balances in the body.”,We live in a society fixated on image and efficiency. These energy drinks are a quick and unhealthy method to avoid consuming the food necessary for proper vitamin and mineral intake. They also give us the ability to stay up longer than our bodies will allow.,Red Bull was only approved for sale by Health Canada in 2004. It is sold as a natural health product (NHP). Based on their ingredients, like caffeine and vitamins, certain products need to be sold as NHPs—not foods—and have natural health product numbers. Other energy beverages including Mountain Dew Energy, have yet to be assessed by Health Canada.,What is most alarming is that although a warning is printed on each product, children will most likely disregard such labels, not knowing how much caffeine is in their beloved green pop or even why they should care. The article reports the safe amount of caffeine for a 10-year-old is 65 milligrams. Mountain Dew Energy exceeds this limit by 25 milligrams.,Regardless of what companies might say, the drinks’ bright colours and pretty packaging are extremely appealing to children. In recent years, children have become yet another market for consumer products—there are even cell phones designed especially for children.,It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers to teach children about nutrition and about products like Mountain Dew Energy, which are marketed to them but are clearly harmful for them. As a society, we must reassess the lifestyles we are promoting. At the same time, we hope Health Canada will reassess its legislation regarding these energy drinks and their makers’ ability to target them to children."},{"title":"Frosh, this one’s for you","url":"/story/2005-09-20/editorials/frosh-ones-you/","date":"September 20, 2005","content":"Back in September of my first year, I got crafty. I grabbed sparkles, squeezed out dollops of glue and snipped myriad letters from fashion magazines to construct a garbage-bag sign to post on my res room door.,“Behave! Smart/ Sophisticated/ Sweet/ Sensual/ Sultry/ Sinful/ Sex goddesses inside,” the pink glitter proclaimed.,Yes, I was having sex. Yes, my roommate was being sinful. But that wasn’t what it was about.,For me, the sign represented liberation and creativity. It was about escaping life with my parents and starting school away from home. It was my symbolic entry into university, a new sort of empowerment.,It was a time and place to make myself. But only a few hours after I tacked my work of art to the door, I overheard giggling girls pass by, remarking on the pretension of whomever lived inside.,Slut. Poser. Wannabe.,It made my blood boil.,I’ll admit I wanted a reaction—I suppose I often do. But such shallow criticism almost instantly changed my conceptions of university life. Unfortunately, there was more that irked me.,I got stuck on a res floor with a bunch of snobs and boys who smeared shit on the public telephone when they got trashed. The group seemed to do everything together. But I was never one to conform to others’ schedules, unwilling to file down to the cafeteria en masse. I avoided joining them at their no-ID-required parties held at the now-defunct Larry’s Pit Stop.,So I spent most of the year with my door shut.,Barring entry into my room also helped my sassy, but depressed, roommate keep her,pet guinea pig a secret the entire year.,I admit I despised many of the people with whom I lived, but during my first visit home, I was stunned to discover I had developed my own nauseating qualities.,High school graduation in October tossed me back into the crowd of my old pals—we who had parted ways to seek challenges at different institutions. As we mingled, I turned up my nose a half-dozen times, snipped at friends and unleashed some snide remarks.,Suddenly, my best friend turned to me. She was blunt.,“You’ve changed,” she said. “You’ve become a snoot!”,I reeled before identifying my seducer.,Queen’s—this beloved university—had indoctrinated me. I’d lived in the bubble for less than a month, and already I thought I was a Queen.,Frosh, get off your high horse before it’s too late. This university hypes you up until you feel so good you think it’s the norm to consider yourself a cut above the rest.,My message? There’s more to this school than an arguably homogeneous mess of students getting drunk on the “Queen’s reputation.” There’s much to protest, much to advocate for—in fact, it’s right on your doorstep.,The Administration is not perfect. Neither is your student government. And rest assured, I know this newspaper isn’t either.,So, challenge the world around you, raise your voice and avoid getting brainwashed. Work hard, question decisions and keep up your drive—then you won’t have to rely on the Queen’s name to get respect.,Plus, you’ll be free to get as crafty as you like."},{"title":"Justice for all, not PR for some","url":"/story/2005-10-14/editorials/justice-all-not-pr-some/","date":"October 14, 2005","content":"Non-academic discipline at Queen’s is a peer-administered system that involves students passing judgment on other students for committing offences. These offences can range in severity from disturbance of the peace up to offences akin to vandalism and assault.,Most of you at this point will be asking “Why should I care?” and for the vast majority of you, this system will be outside your experiences at Queen’s. Since 1898, this system has been run by the student government, and by all accounts, has worked well as a restorative, transparent process that has ensured fair treatment for those accused of violating the Queen’s Code of Conduct. The process is accountable to AMS Assembly, and decisions can be appealed to the University Student Appeals Board (USAB ).,Unknown to most of you, the system now faces a crisis. Not a crisis of justice, but a crisis of PR. Surrounding the events of Homecoming, many violations of the Code of Conduct were reported. Normally, the AMS handles the cases that are defined under its jurisdiction and even handles cases in a parallel, but not substitutable fashion to Canadian criminal or civil courts. This has worked well in the past, and ensures that those responsible face punishment, whether it is a fine up to $500 or, at its most serious, suspension or expulsion. Homecoming is presenting the system with a challenge because there are those in the administration who are looking for immediate action and results at the cost of this student-directed process. You should care about our system of discipline because the administration is talking about removing a process that has been in place for over a century and taking matters into their own hands to unilaterally cast judgment on those accused of wrongdoing. While this plays very well to the angry citizens’ groups and the media, the administration’s proposal to bypass the judicial process carries with it dangerous consequences. They wish to remove the due process of the AMS, and give the authority straight to an administration that currently has no investigatory capacity, no due process and no mechanism of appeal should there be any procedural problems. In fact, they don’t even have procedural safeguards in place to be violated.,While there are serious consequences to the events on Aberdeen, student discipline should not be one of its casualties. A student discipline process enshrines the principle of peers judging peers. We’re all students, generally away from home, and all understand what it means to be a student at Queen’s. This sympathy and understanding gives those on the Judicial Committee the insight and authority to say when a fellow student has acted with poor judgment and has tarnished the reputation of Queen’s University. The Judicial Committee doesn’t make decisions to satisfy the media, but makes them based on what is fair and just. A system of justice should reflect a level of integrity a university administration more concerned with their image in the Whig-Standard than process and fairness could not provide. That is why I would hope that before any drastic action to curtail the discipline process is taken, the system be given a chance to once again prove why it has survived into its third century."},{"title":"Who you gonna call?

These are just a few of the recent threats made by police and city officials in regard to what could happen next year should the Aberdeen Street party continue. But wait a minute. Hold the phone. If this year’s Aberdeen party was a “riot,” where were the police this year?,It was certainly wise for police to retreat and set up roadblocks following a (some say coordinated) rush of students to Aberdeen Street around 11 p.m. on Saturday. But did the police regroup? Did they create a new plan of action to regain control of the crowd? No. The police basically did nothing. As officers told people the street was closed, many party-goers walked through neighbouring yards, hopped fences, and there it was—Aberdeen in all its appalling glory. What continues to really irk me is the way police officers stationed at either end of of the street stood with their backs to Aberdeen. There was no authority on Aberdeen, it was pure anarchy.,But the thing I found most disgusting,in this whole debacle was that the police had an opportunity to alter the course of the evening and they chose not to. At the smell of gas from the now infamous car, two fire trucks were brought in to Aberdeen, lights flashing and sirens blaring. Firefighters inspected the car, circled it a few times, and then they walked away.,Now let me be completely clear on something: when the fire trucks came in,,Aberdeen Street was cleared from Earl Street to the car. Little effort would have been required to bring in a tow truck to take the car away. But that didn’t happen. The car was left for the partiers to further destroy, the police went back to their roadblocks, and people crowded the southern section of the street once again.,Of course, there is the matter of the car. According to the Kingston Whig-Standard, the car was stolen on Sept. 16. Now fast forward nine days to Saturday. The car was parked on Aberdeen during the day, and by evening it was the only car parked on Aberdeen. On Saturday night, when I saw the car, there were no licence plates on it.,Now, we all know the police were aggressively patrolling Aberdeen throughout Saturday. So how is it that police failed to notice a car, all by itself, with no licence plates attached? I doubt it could have been more glaringly obvious if the car had magically flown through the air.,While I think it’s vital for us as a student body to examine what happened and punish those responsible, I also think it’s about time we as a community demand an examination of the way policing is carried out in Kingston.,One thing is for certain: when I see police cars, I no longer feel safe. I feel a little bit threatened, a whole lot defensive, and just plain angry. And that just seems so very wrong."},{"title":"Dear Coffee & Co.","url":"/story/2005-10-04/editorials/dear-coffee-and-co/","date":"October 4, 2005","content":"Dear Coffee and Co. on the corner of Division and Johnson,,Yesterday it was pointed out to me that you and Stooley’s are gaining a new neighbour on the corner of Division and Johnson. While I really shouldn’t judge any company that decides to move in and market itself to the many students of the area, I’m still slightly upset by this. For those who haven’t heard, the multinational super-company Starbucks is moving in across the street from both Coffee and Co. and Stooley’s. Since this is a company that’s giving students a new option for their coffee in the morning, afternoon, and night, I feel that being really upset isn’t called for. However, to let Starbucks simply appear without anyone saying anything would be rather unfortunate.,I’m aware that Starbucks is an extremely popular place to hang out. That’s obvious just by walking by the one that moved in downtown last year. It was vandalized but continues to be a thriving business. I am also aware that many people enjoy Starbucks coffee and other exciting caffeinated drinks, but I am not one of them. And no, it isn’t because Starbucks seems to appear on every street corner in many cities of the world or because they moved in next to the Sleepless Goat downtown—it’s simply because I do not like their coffee, much like I don’t like the coffee of Dunkin’ Donuts. Although it pains me to say it, I am sure for the many students who do enjoy it, this will be a welcome addition to the Ghetto area.,But this editorial is not supposed to bash Starbucks for being who they are, but rather to praise you, Coffee and Co., for always being there and making your fine brew. While it is true you only have four different coffees brewing at any given time, I often find myself impressed with both your constantly changing flavoured coffee (Highlander Cream being my favourite by far) and your simple light roasts that don’t feel like shots of adrenaline every time I take a sip. You open early enough for any student making an 8:30 class, and you close your doors late enough for anyone to grab a late-night coffee fix. Your music is light and unobtrusive for anyone choosing to read a book or furiously study. And, there always seem to be both permanent residents of Kingston and students lining up and sitting down in your chairs—something that is extremely rare, it seems, in the Ghetto. While most coffee shops have this similar atmosphere, it is good to see one so close to the heart of the Ghetto—and especially near the ever-so-infamous Aberdeen Street—where students and residents seem to live in a state of harmony. So Coffee and Co. on the corner of Division and Johnson, thank you for being there and making your fantastic coffee, and know whichever mega coffee corporation that decides to move in across the street from you, you will always have at least one customer lining up at your door."},{"title":"End to tuition freeze in Ontario inevitable","url":"/story/2005-10-14/editorials/end-tuition-freeze-ontario-inevitable/","date":"October 14, 2005","content":"At Carleton University on Sept. 30, Premier Dalton McGuinty announced that the current post-secondary tuition freeze will soon be lifted.,He added that the provincial government intends to create more grants and make additional forms of funding available.,Although the end of the freeze will likely mean higher tuition fees, it was unreasonable to hope the freeze would last forever. A tuition freeze is not a long-term way to keep university accessible. One long-term solution is to increase student assistance and funding, which the provincial government has pledged to do.,It simply isn’t feasible to expect tuition to remain the same while the standard of living continues to rise. At some point, a balance must be struck.,While Queen’s Arts and Science students face an increase in tuition, engineering and Commerce students as well as international students have faced incremental tuition hikes for quite some time. At Queen’s, for tuition alone, international students in Arts and Science pay over $15,000.,As much as we may not like it, tuition will have to increase to meet the cost of living.,We hope, however, that the provincial government will implement a better financial assistance program to make funding more readily available to students.,That way, tuition fees can rise with the cost of living without impeding accessibility rather than staying frozen and giving students a nasty shock a few years down the line."},{"title":"Council recommendations a good start","url":"/story/2005-10-06/editorials/council-recommendations-good-start/","date":"October 6, 2005","content":"Tuesday night, at the Kingston city council meeting, councillors voted in favour of requesting that Queen’s provide financial compensation for the costs of having the police, fire and ambulance services on Aberdeen Street during Homecoming weekend.,They also approved the creation of a committee directed at finding ways to thwart any future illegal activity in the Sydenham district. It should be noted that council voted to remove a clause to potentially grant police the ability to use more drastic measures to control crowds. It was impressive that—for the most part—councillors were able to make rational decisions. Floyd Patterson, councillor for Sydenham district and Rick Downes, councillor for King’s Town, were particularly well-informed and level-headed. Patterson moved for the creation of the committee.,It is our hope that this new committee will not only address general student-city relations, like the Principal’s Task Force on Community Relations, but also discuss possible initiatives to prevent events of Aberdeen’s magnitude from occurring in coming years. The decisions of this committee will have a great impact on the future of Homecoming. Extensive research must be conducted in order for the committee to come up with lasting and effective long-term solutions.,Members of the University administration and the AMS will also sit on this committee. It was good to see the AMS in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting, representing the students. The AMS has an important task ahead of them. Without their diligence to ensure student voices are heard and taken into account, any future solutions won’t work. It is necessary, however, to establish that the University was not responsible for the events on Aberdeen. It made the effort to present an alternative in holding the Miller Hall concert. Students in attendance at Aberdeen should take responsibility for their actions and perhaps offer to help the city pay for the upwards of $60,000 in costs. Two groups of students have already taken it upon themselves to raise money to help Bob Hanson, the owner of the car that was set ablaze. Perhaps some of those proceeds could be redirected towards helping the city with the costs incurred, and more students could contribute to the fundraisers with that in mind.,The creation of a committee to find definitive solutions to prevent further incidents like the events on Aberdeen is a good start. This will hopefully facilitate discussion, preventing any rash or spur-of-the-moment decisions from being made."},{"title":"The woes of retail therapy","url":"/story/2005-09-27/editorials/woes-retail-therapy/","date":"September 27, 2005","content":"Given the stress of a new school year, a friend and I decided to spend some time on ourselves. We dubbed it “retail therapy,” and spent the afternoon shopping, not because we needed the clothes, and not for lack of anything better to do, but because we both wanted to experience the joy of buying new things. This, I’m aware, is the epitome of materialism and the result of living in a fairly capitalist society.,I’ll be the first to admit that the whole idea seems ridiculous. As a self-proclaimed tomboy and riot gurl in my former years, I can’t say I’m used to being up for a full-fledged day of consumerism. The thought of someone devoting their time and money entirely to themselves just seems wrong, not to mention selfish. Someone with such a privileged ability would surely find enough satisfaction with what they have and dedicate time to a more selfless cause.,Such was not the case on a fine afternoon last week when I dropped quite a lot of coin ... and I can’t wait to adorn my body in these new items.,I’m certain that, had I spent the same amount of time volunteering at a soup kitchen, or reading to the elderly, I would have felt more satisfied with myself and my abilities as a contributing member of society. And, yes, I know of this wonderful feeling first-hand.,But I found myself questioning my former logic and asking, what was wrong with spending a little time entirely on me in a blur of consumption? I discovered that there actually is something very troubling about this form of therapy: the fact that it is almost entirely a female phenomenon.,I used the reasoning that I felt overwhelmed with school work and extra-curricular activities to justify my shopping spree, but the truth is that, as a female, I feel the need to adorn myself in beautiful garments, not for the sake of fashion, but because it makes me feel better about my mental state.,I recently told my housemate about this, hoping she’d offer some advice. Anita is a post-doctoral student, specializing in social justice and development. She told me I did all of this because, as a female, I’m triggered by oppression. Women feel the need to shop ’till they drop because they are on a persistent search to prove themselves worthy by the clothes they wear. I shudder to think that, yes, she’s right. After all, my closet is chock-full of the fruits of these outbursts, and a lot of them I rarely wear.,A remedy for the blues this isn’t—a far cry from it, apparently. And it’s turning into an addiction. When I feel down, I turn to my debit card, instead of a good friend, to numb my pain. It’s pretty pathetic, and it’s in no way a solution. If anything, it’s just a temporary fix.,I’m afraid I’ve become a willing victim of the spending culture. I used to participate in the annual Buy Nothing Day in order to curb my consumption. Now I spend money on things I don’t actually need for the joy of materialism."},{"title":"Rites of the river","url":"/story/2005-10-18/editorials/rites-river/","date":"October 18, 2005","content":"As of yesterday, at 11:40 a.m., I am officially 21 years old. As I was getting ready for this birthday I realized that it means nothing to me. What does it mean to be 21? I’m now allowed to drink in the U.S., but what else is there when you’re 21? I feel like I’ve passed all the exciting birthdays: 16 when—after years of dreaming—driving is within your reach, 18 when you legally become an adult and 19 when alcohol is something you are allowed to have in public instead of something secret.,What do you have ahead of you when you turn 21?,As a teenager, birthdays signify adulthood by conferring adult privileges, and they are as unforgettable as the first time you drive a car.,Something I remember more vividly than any of those significant birthdays was a true rite of passage I underwent the summer I was 17. With the camp I had been attending for six years, I paddled down the Harricana River with 13 friends in northern Quebec. When the river spilled out into James Bay, we paddled nearly 80 kilometres across the southernmost tip of the Bay to arrive in Moosonee two days later, hungry and exhausted. This experience, which I shared with those I paddled the river with and those who had paddled it before me, allowed me to join the ranks of those who had “been to the Bay,” and was something I had always wanted to do.,Having endured an incredible experience and coming out stronger for it, I became an adult, not legally, but in the eyes of those I respected. I had a greater sense of myself and my abilities. Only then did I feel more like a woman, and less like a little girl. That experience made me more of an adult than when I first drove a car or bought alcohol.,Rites of passage exist in many other cultures, but within our own the rites of passage are tied to randomly chosen dates. However, we are not bound to these dates to decide what makes us adults; we can do that on our own.,I’m not suggesting that everyone needs to paddle down a wild river in the north to become an adult, but that you choose an experience your own. Regardless of the activity, it is simply a process of pushing beyond what one thinks is reasonable and coming back with a greater knowledge of oneself and one’s place in a greater community that makes it a rite of passage.,To those of you who turn 18 or 19 this year, I salute you. Have a great birthday, and enjoy the rights and privileges that you have been given. However, please consider challenging yourself and taking a journey to a place beyond your current experience, and coming back stronger, as an adult in your own eyes."},{"title":"Martin upholds political ideals","url":"/story/2005-10-04/editorials/martin-upholds-political-ideals/","date":"October 4, 2005","content":"During the next three weeks, a gathering of Catholic bishops may consider denying Holy Communion to politicians who have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage. Although a practicing Catholic, Prime Minister Paul Martin has maintained that he will separate his personal beliefs from his duties as a politician.,In vowing to place his responsibilities as prime minister ahead of his faith, Martin has shown the kind of qualities we should expect in the leader of a representative liberal democracy. The separation of church and state has been a recent issue of contention. We have seen, time and time again, George W. Bush’s refusal to support same-sex marriage or stem cell research because of,his own religious beliefs. We are thus fortunate to have in Martin, a politician who is able to acknowledge that in a diverse country such as Canada, it’s inappropriate and unfair for the Catholic church to dictate policy.,In response to the legalization of same-sex marriage, other MPs, including NDP MPs Charlie Angus and Joe Comartin, have also faced ostracization by their respective churches. However, Cardinal Marc Oullet told the Toronto Star, “You do not lose your right to belong to a community because you do not vote in the right way ... We are all sinners in one way or another, so we have to be welcoming for all our members. We are a community of sinners.” Martin’s own church, St. Jean de Brébeuf in Montreal, has also indicated it will continue to administer Holy Communion to him.,The Catholic church should reassess its decision to consider denying communion to politicians. The Vatican needs to recognize its parishioners’ daily realities rather than using its influence to push for a policy the majority of the population does not support and considers to be in opposition to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.,Paul Martin’s recent decision to stand by his legalization of same-sex marriage, amidst suggestions that he could be denied Holy Communion, has shown great strength as a leader in his ability to differentiate between the needs of his constituents and his personal beliefs."},{"title":"SPAT a good student-run initiative","url":"/story/2005-10-18/editorials/spat-good-student-run-initiative/","date":"October 18, 2005","content":"The Student Property Assessment Team (SPAT) is a new AMS initiative created by the Municipal Affairs Commission.

No one wants to be thrown out of their house—condemned as it may be—in January. SPAT inspectors, who are also students, will be a good alternative for students who may not feel comfortable speaking with city officials.,Just because it’s called the Ghetto does not mean the housing area around campus has to live up to its name.

According to Fitzgerald’s sources, this group was formed by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card in August 2002, well before the war on Iraq.,Top White House officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and Bush’s “architect,” Karl Rove, could be indicted for their roles in the release of Plame’s identity. This has the White House scrambling to keep things under wraps, because the implication is that Fitzgerald “is prepared to shine an unwelcome light on the White House team established to sell Americans on a pre-ordained Iraq war.”,It is appalling that the Iraq war was in the works before there were any valid suspicions that the country was harbouring weapons of mass destruction, the reason the Bush administration has consistently given for its preemptive invasion. In September 2002, Card told the New York Times they had a “meticulously planned strategy” and that “from a marketing point of view, you don’t introduce new products in August,” which was why the wheels began turning in September instead.,Regardless of the outcome of Fitzgerald’s investigation, heads are going to roll in Washington. It has been speculated that if Fitzgerald publishes a report, the person who would be most affected is Vice President Cheney. The possibility that Bush will lose some of his closest advisors will leave the U.S. president not only vulnerable but forced to face the public and his critics alone, for the first time. WHIG officials used the American people as pawns under the false pretence of protecting the nation from Iraq, and it is about time its senior members were held accountable for their actions.,Ultimately, the fate of the Bush administration lies in the hands of the citizens it purports to represent and defend. They were the ones who gave him the power he has and they should be the ones who decide whether and how they will take it away. It is crucial that they make their opposition known, and not stand by complacently to watch this “a smoking gun” become a “mushroom cloud.”,As Fitzgerald’s investigation continues, evidence is mounting that suggests that individuals in the WHIG fabricated information in order to “sell” the war on Iraq to the American public. Not only does this point to Bush’s blatant deception of his country, but it also leaves open the implications of what could happen if indeed Fitzgerald’s suspicions prove true—not only to America, but to the people of Iraq. The American citizens, now more than ever, need to demand the truth, for their sake and for that of the Iraqi people."},{"title":"Madness & mayhem on Aberdeen","url":"/story/2005-09-27/editorials/madness-and-mayhem-aberdeen/","date":"September 27, 2005","content":"Smashing bottles is not a Queen’s tradition. Flipping cars is not part of the Queen’s spirit. As a student body, Saturday night was not our finest moment. It is a blemish on the reputation of this university.

The usual sense of fun was replaced by a sense of chaos, mayhem, and complete and utter recklessness.,At one point in the evening, a car was overturned and subsequently set ablaze. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable and an embarrassment to Queen’s. It was the type of behaviour that sometimes occurs when people protest political injustice or voice,their opposition to war. But in this case, it seems students were defending their “right” to be above the law. This only encourages the incorrect stereotype that Queen’s students are all spoiled, well-to-do brats.,It’s unfortunate that the stupidity of a few Queen’s and non-Queen’s individuals has cast such a dark shadow over the rest of the student population. In the past, Aberdeen was an opportunity for students to celebrate Homecoming with friends and to connect with other students. But this year, it took a turn for the worse. Many students feared for their safety amidst the deliberate smashing of beer bottles and other raucous activity. During Homecoming, each of us is responsible for our own behaviour and the behaviour of our guests. However, this fact seemed lost on Aberdeen.,Kingston police were out in full force, attempting to keep irresponsible parties in line on Aberdeen. The fact that it was possible for a car to be set on fire amidst the full strength of the police force points to the ineffectiveness of their strategy for ensuring student safety. The lines of police officers on either side blocking entry onto Aberdeen did not deter students in the least. They simply gained access through the backyards of houses in the vicinity. By attempting to control the partying on Aberdeen in barring further entry, the police only caused the partying to spill onto surrounding streets like Johnson, Earl and William. Their strategy only aided in the proliferation of the raucous behaviour taking place.,What’s more, there were few, if any, officers actually on Aberdeen. Perhaps if there were police officers patrolling, students would not have had the opportunity to jump atop the car and set it on fire. If police were able to exert enough force to clear the area in order to allow fire trucks in to extinguish the fire, they should have been able to stop the dangerous activity before it got out of hand. Although the police presence was greater than in the past, it was less effective because it was misplaced and underutilized.,Even before Homecoming, the publicity given to Aberdeen and the increased police presence did little to decrease attendance. If anything, it only spurred interest. The radio and print campaigns by the University and the AMS—an effort to deter bad behaviour—also added to the hype. All the negative attention set the stage for this self-fulfilling prophecy. To quote the AMS ad that appeared in the Journal: “If something can go wrong it will.” The University should, however, be commended for attempting to present an alternative to Aberdeen. Although it didn’t decrease the number of people at Aberdeen, it was nonetheless a successful concert, enjoyed by those in attendance. The concert could have been more effective at keeping the crowd around if Metric had headlined instead of Billy Talent. In the future, the University should continue to present well-planned alternatives to Aberdeen by holding events such as the concert.,The Aberdeen Homecoming celebrations seem to be heading down a slippery slope. We’re lucky more people weren’t hurt, but maybe next year we won’t be so lucky. Aberdeen will inevitably continue in years to come, but after this weekend, better strategies must be found in order to prevent serious injuries.,The mob mentality of Saturday night on Aberdeen was unacceptable. It wasn’t the kind of behaviour that would ever be attributed to “leaders and citizens for a global society.” The resulting media coverage of Queen’s is unfortunate, because the vast majority of Queen’s students did not participate in the violence and remain upstanding leaders and citizens. Those who did behave illegally and recklessly on Aberdeen Street need to take responsibility for their actions. They should be dealt with under the law and by the AMS Prosecutor’s Office.,However, we should by no means allow the behaviour of a few reckless individuals to eclipse the fact that students at Queen’s are, for the most part, responsible. The future of Aberdeen has yet to unfold, but there is no doubt that things will have to change.,The police’s strategy is not working. Many students are not considering the impact of their actions. There needs to be better communication between students, the police and the community to find strategies that work—namely, that they don’t exacerbate the problem."},{"title":"Letter offends, misrepresents students","url":"/story/2005-10-04/editorials/letter-offends-misrepresents-students/","date":"October 4, 2005","content":"Adèle Mercier’s letter to the Toronto Star spurred an intense reaction from Queen’s students. Her depiction of those on Aberdeen as “numbskulls worthy of the Hitler youth at the drop of a beer keg,” is hardly an accurate representation of the student body.,Her letter is offensive on many, many levels. To liken students to brainwashed children of the Third Reich is insulting to all, particularly Jewish students. Queen’s Hillel has asked for an apology from Mercier. She refuses to apologize and remains adamant about her comments. References of this nature point to carelessness, insensitivity and a lack of forethought on Mercier’s part before sending this letter.,If in fact Mercier wrote the letter with her students’ best interests at heart, as she claims she did, she could have found a more tactful, more effective way to express her opinions. Instead, she chose to send this letter to the Toronto Star, the largest daily newspaper in the country.,Moreover, in the same letter, Mercier proceeded to refer to those on Aberdeen as “white, privileged, middle-class kids.” This gross over-generalization misrepresents the diverse student body at Queen’s and is an insult to the many students who worked multiple jobs, took out multiple loans, and essentially saved every penny they had in order to come to this school. For someone who has attested to being “dedicated” to her students, this comes across as a complete disregard for their feelings. The school’s reputation has already been tarnished, and Mercier has simply proliferated a false image of Queen’s as an out-of-control school lacking any structure or morals.,She has subsequently responded by stating that her reference to “Hitler youth” was only meant to draw a comparison to Queen’s students in the way that both groups were “just nice kids that stopped thinking.” Had she made this analogy clear in her original letter and chosen a less offensive group to use for comparison, there would not have been such a flood of responses. We agree that there was a lack of reasoning at Aberdeen, but that in no way could it possibly compare to mass genocide.,Adèle Mercier’s letter has only fueled the continuing saga of Aberdeen. Comparing partiers to “Hitler youth” has done nothing to improve the situation. If anything, it has reaffirmed the media’s untrue stereotypes of Queen’s students, and offended those with painful connections to a Nazi past."},{"title":"U of T president goes back to undergrad","url":"/story/2005-10-06/editorials/u-t-president-goes-back-undergrad/","date":"October 6, 2005","content":"David Naylor, U of T’s new president, spent his first day on the job attending classes and will continue to do so for the rest of the week at all three of U of T’s campuses. He will also be going to basketball practice and talking to students in the cafeterias. He told the Toronto Star he was doing this to get an idea of “how the university looks and feels for students.”,The student experience became a focal point for the school after U of T received a low score on the National Survey of Student Engagement, a survey Queen’s topped out of the Canadian schools involved. Naylor will be getting a first-hand look at what it’s like to sit in a physics class or a Canadian politics class. While attending these classes he will be able to judge how effective they are, how comfortable the students are, and simply remind himself of what undergraduate life is all about.,Student engagement may not be such a problem at a residential school like Queen’s, but for a university with a student enrolment of 70,000, 80 per cent of whom commute from off campus, it is particularly challenging. Naylor is taking the necessary steps to make the students feel like they’re a part of the university, and not simply a source of revenue.,His appearance among students on the three campuses will make him a more noticeable figure at U of T. It will also eliminate the image of the administration residing in an ivory tower, separate from the students. This is a sign of camaraderie, a message to the students, telling them that the administration is on their side and interested in their concerns.,Naylor acknowledges that his week-long attendance in various classes will not be enough. He said, “I’m under no illusion that a few days’ biopsy will yield a complete understanding of the university and its students.” Although this is true, the fact that Naylor is making a sincere effort to engage students shows them that there is a real-life, concerned person behind all the decisions made and that the administration cares.,We encourage other university leaders to take a cue from David Naylor and make understanding student issues a priority."},{"title":"Wrong way to encourage women engineers","url":"/story/2005-10-14/editorials/wrong-way-encourage-women-engineers/","date":"October 14, 2005","content":"A recent Toronto Star article reported that the number of women studying engineering in Ontario is on the decline.,Five years ago, 30 per cent of first-year engineering students were female, compared to 20 per cent today. In response to the decline, engineering schools have taken steps to entice women back to engineering by eliminating Ontario’s grade 12 geometry and discrete mathematics course as an entrance requirement. Instead, the article reports, applicants may substitute more “female-friendly” courses, such as biology.,It is one thing to identify that students are consistently experiencing difficulty with a specific course. It is another thing to frame the issue in gendered terms and to substitute courses based on the perception that girls don’t do well or are intimidated. The majority of students find math challenging regardless of gender.,While it is good to see that an effort is being made to increase female enrolment in engineering, a core course should not be substituted simply for the sake of numbers. If in fact geometry and discrete mathematics is a necessary course for subsequent success in engineering, it should by no means be relegated to being an optional credit. If the course is not necessary, make it optional, but don’t tie the change to the issue of women’s enrolment.,The engineering schools have also committed to hosting events to promote engineering as a field of study to high school girls, which is commendable. However, education about science and engineering should not begin during high school, but in elementary school.,Girls should be taught that not only boys can become engineers, just as boys should be taught that they can become teachers and nurses. These gender distinctions in the work force are merely a manifestation of archaic social norms that are not applicable to today’s society.,Lower numbers of female engineering students also point to an even greater societal issue. Girls often learn, subconsciously and from an early age, to be intimidated by the presence of boys and that they shouldn’t show off their intelligence if they want to be considered attractive. Adults often take this for granted, failing to realize that even the most trivial and seemingly insignificant comments easily make lasting impressions on children.,Although initiatives like conferences and workshops are important to educate high school students, particularly girls, about engineering, their attitudes have already been formed at home and in the classroom. Teachers should be better equipped to not only deliver material in a way that engages both boys and girls, but also to adapt to different learning styles, which may be an even greater reason than social norms for why students often dislike math.,While altering the admission criteria is a sign that the engineering schools care, it’s an ineffective and even insulting approach. A necessary course should not be made optional solely on the misguided basis that girls find the course difficult and that without this course, more girls will enroll in engineering. Improvements to teaching strategies would go far to engage students or at least help them understand the material."},{"title":"Aberdeen coverage too sensational","url":"/story/2005-09-30/editorials/aberdeen-coverage-too-sensational/","date":"September 30, 2005","content":"In the past few days the events on Aberdeen have garnered immense amounts of negative publicity, not just locally but across the country. Police Chief Bill Closs described it as a “drunken street brawl” in the Kingston Whig-Standard. The CTV website called it a “drunken brawl with police.” The Toronto Star reported Aberdeen as an “alcohol-fuelled riot.” Individuals who actually attended the Aberdeen party can attest that the events of last Saturday don’t deserve to be given that much credit. It was a drunken, unorganized gathering that got completely out of hand. The sensationalizing of events points to the need on the part of media outlets to attract attention and as a result, readership. The unfortunate reality is that scandal and controversy sell.,Most disheartening is the fact that all the other positive events of Homecoming have been overshadowed by Aberdeen. Aberdeen has come to represent Homecoming, and those unfamiliar with the Queen’s tradition will associate Homecoming with drunken mayhem.,While a great deal of attention was paid to the foolish and asinine behaviour of a few drunken individuals, the City of Kingston witnessed its second homicide of the year on Sunday morning. At the bottom of Monday’s Kingston Whig-Standard, beneath a large photograph of a KCVI student standing atop an overturned car, a smaller article explained how 23-year-old Lindsey May Dibert was killed. Her death, allegedly at her boyfriend’s hands, went relatively unnoticed by the community amidst the flurry of responses to Aberdeen Street events. The misbehaviour of a select group of kids should never have eclipsed the death of this young woman. Aberdeen simply doesn’t warrant this amount of news coverage, not when much more important issues, such as the ongoing tragedy of domestic violence, are at hand.,As a student paper, the Journal seeks to represent students properly, with accurate, balanced coverage and without profit quotas to meet. Photos of the Aberdeen party have appeared in major papers like the Toronto Star. However, they will never be photos taken by the Journal. In an effort to prevent the proliferation of the incorrect idea that Queen’s is a school out of control, Journal photographers have made a conscious decision not to release their photos to other media outlets. Although the behaviour of some people at Aberdeen was deplorable, it was not representative of students at Queen’s, and we intend to ensure that the distortion of the Queen’s reputation is not further propagated."},{"title":"Engage students, then the world","url":"/story/2005-10-18/editorials/engage-students-then-world/","date":"October 18, 2005","content":"Principal Hitchcock’s “Engaging the World” is a discussion paper outlining the principal’s vision for the future of Queen’s—namely, “global engagement.”,The principal’s discussion paper incorporates broad phrases and jargon, but few specifics as to how exactly this “global engagement” will be brought about. While it emphasizes the hoped-for position of Queen’s on the world stage and recruiting top scholars and students from outside Canada, it devotes little attention to this institution’s current students and staff and issues they are now facing.,“Engaging the World,” however, is a step in the right direction. Rather than opening hotlines for residents, Principal Hitchcock is making an attempt to open lines of communication between her and the students at this university.,That said, her discussion paper is focused on Queen’s as a research institution. She mentions improving technology and also making “strategic investments in defined areas of ... strength.” This commitment to improving specific areas may mean that other areas will fall to the wayside and be allowed to deteriorate.,Hitchcock makes a strong commitment to improving and developing graduate programs. Although this may help Queen’s attain the worldwide recognition the paper repeatedly refers to, it does not negate the fact that there are other aspects to the University aside from graduate studies. It is important that a balance is struck between supporting graduate programs and research while still maintaining and bettering the quality of the undergraduate education the University offers.,For instance, if Hitchcock is looking to elevate the University’s reputation, she need look no further than the students (undergraduate and otherwise) walking around campus. There is no better way to advance the Queen’s reputation than letting the achievements of alumni to speak for themselves. If alumni do great things, the value of a Queen’s degree in the rest of the world will rise proportionally. With this in mind, it would be advantageous for the University to invest in the future and its reputation by investing in the students it currently educates. It can do so most effectively by focusing on reducing class sizes and improving deteriorating buildings—basic initiatives that will greatly increase the quality of undergraduate education.,Students who leave with a positive experience from Queen’s will become the school’s best ambassadors and supporters. If the principal addresses the short-term issues that affect these students, great strides will be made in dealing with the long-term issues of recruitment, curricular breadth and “global engagement.”,The discussion paper seems to suggest that undergraduate studies have or will become subordinate to graduate studies. However, if one priority of “Engaging the World” is to “attract the best students and scholars from across Canada and internationally” it should also be a priority to produce undergraduate students of this calibre.,Its focus on attracting prospective students makes it difficult for current students to factor themselves into the equation. It is our responsibility as students to make our concerns known at the upcoming town hall meetings. If we accept Hitchcock’s invitation “to participate fully” we can help make the future vision for the University something we can all engage with."},{"title":"Barrie concert: Live 8 or G8?","url":"/story/2005-06-28/editorials/barrie-concert-live-8-or-g8/","date":"June 28, 2005","content":"In the past few weeks there has been an enormous media frenzy over the upcoming Live 8, a series of concerts to be held around the world on July 6; the date coincides with the G8 summit where G8 nations are being called upon to forgive debt in Africa. Bob Geldof recently announced that a Canadian concert will be held in Barrie.,With all the hype over the international performer line-up, which includes U2, Paul McCartney and Madonna, there is concern that the purpose of the concerts will be lost. Once people are at the event, organizers and performers should take the opportunity to educate their audiences.,The line-ups seem to be aimed at an older demographic. While they do form the majority of the voting population and are the main source of donations and funding, it would also be worthwhile to engage the younger generation as political change is the aim of this musical campaign. It must, however, be acknowledged however that “younger” performers were invited, but due to prior scheduling engagements—which Live 8 organizers should have anticipated—they could not attend. At the same time, aside from the African Guitar Summit and DobaCaracol featuring Kna’an, there is currently a lack of diversity in the Barrie event that is supposed to be calling attention to autonomy and diversity.,Hopefully, the Live 8 will be as intended: a call on the G8 to provide aid and remove African debt and not just an event of mass consumption."},{"title":"CBC woes bring quality into question","url":"/story/2005-09-09/editorials/cbc-woes-bring-quality-question/","date":"September 9, 2005","content":"The nearly four-week CBC lockout of 5,500 of its employees has brought all of the company’s outlets to a virtual standstill. Negotiations had been taking place between CBC management and its employees’ union for the past 15 months with little progress. The main issue of contention is the CBC’s plan to hire more non-permanent employees in an effort to alleviate financial strains on the company.,However, the union sees this as a move towards phasing out permanent employees. Similar trends in the private sector suggest that temporary workers who are not entitled to benefits appears to be the way of the future; nevertheless, it is unfortunate that the well-loved CBC has become its most recent victim. The CBC has always maintained a high quality of news and entertainment. In the past few weeks programming has come undone. Aside from short one-minute summaries, the news has been delegated to the BBC news broadcast. Programs have suddenly stopped halfway through, replaced with a written explanation that “the CBC is currently experiencing a labour disruption.”,Another casualty of the lockout is that less well-known musicians and artists are not receiving the publicity they need. The CBC has often taken the risk to broadcast the work of artists not considered “mainstream.” As a result, many are left without an outlet to showcase their talent.,As a Canadian network dedicated not wholly to dividends but also to developing a culture and awareness of our nation, it is our hope that the CBC and its employees will try to find a solution for the company’s financial woes without sacrificing the integrity of the CBC we have grown to love and rely on.,Could we even fathom another year without Hockey Night in Canada?"},{"title":"Union Street planning process flawed","url":"/story/2005-05-24/editorials/union-street-planning-process-flawed/","date":"May 24, 2005","content":"At a public meeting on May 5, the Union Street Improvement Project unveiled two preliminary plans to renovate Union Street by constructing a more aesthetically pleasing streetscape. According to project planners, it will “provide a comprehensive and cohesive vision for Union Street.” There is ambiguity surrounding the plans, but according to SGPS president, Dave Thomas and Project Director, Jeanne Ma, both proposals include demolishing all or part of The Grad Club.,Neither the bar’s manager, nor its Board of Directors or the SGPS were made aware of any significant changes to the building—until the meeting. This failure to consult The Grad Club is a mark both of inconsideration and lack of knowledge about the significance of the bar to students.,Had even the most basic research been conducted in developing these proposals, project directors would have discovered that The Grad Club is an essential establishment on campus. It is a popular hangout for faculty, as well as for graduate and undergraduate students. It is also a successful live music venue.,No alternatives for relocation of the bar were suggested, which in itself would be challenging, since an intrinsic, inseparable part of The Grad Club is the building itself, and any changes to it would dramatically alter the unique atmosphere it provides.,The project directors emphasize that the creation of this streetscape would deter traffic. However, traffic at the intersection of Barrie and Union streets is not heavy enough to warrant the construction of a traffic circle and the uprooting of a well-loved establishment like The Grad Club.,In light of all the money that has already been infused into improving the aesthetics of campus—namely the Queen’s Centre—it hardly seems feasible to spend more money when existing infrastructure, such as classrooms, are in dire need of improvement.,The public meetings thus far have been held at the most inopportune time for students to voice their opinions. The first meeting fell on March 31, just before exam period began, and the May 7 meeting took place after most undergraduate students had already left for the summer.,It is imperative that concerned students voice their opposition to these ill-conceived proposals now, while plans are still in their preliminary stages.

Here’s a brief overview of some ongoing issues:,• Construction of the Queen’s Centre, which will replace the current student centre and athletics facilities, is set to begin in 2006; however, it will take 10 to 15 years to complete, which means students paying the fee now will not be able to reap the benefits of the Centre. Beginning this year, each student will pay a mandatory $71 fee; five years later, the fee will increase to $141.,• Homecoming, a long-standing Queen’s tradition, has always created tension between the City and the students. Last year resulted in a police crackdown, while the Administration established a hotline for residents to report unruly students, all culminating in the creation of the Principal’s Task Force. In order to eliminate this division between students and the community, we all must recognize that ultimately, we are all residents of Kingston.,• As students and future “citizens and leaders for a global society,” it cannot be stressed enough how important it is to hold our representatives accountable. At Queen’s we have our student government, the Alma Mater Society (AMS), the Rector, our representative to the Administration, and the Main Campus Residents’ Council (MCRC). By utilizing our right to vote, we can influence who represents us.,• The Rae Review was released earlier this year and its recommendations will mean funding for postsecondary institutions and an increase in loans and financial support for students. However, the Review comes amidst departmental budget cuts and the looming threat of tuition deregulation. As students it is important that we voice our opinions and become informed about changes that will affect each of us.,• Although Queen’s is a small and close-knit community, students must still be aware of safety on and off campus. In light of the recent murder of Queen’s student Justin Schwieg at a downtown bar, safety has come to the forefront. Assaults happen on campus and in the student Ghetto. Safety can be as simple as calling Walkhome, being aware of your surroundings and of the on-campus blue lights, and locking your doors.,• The new AMS executive was elected by the students on a platform of being more inclusive to students and holding landlords accountable. We as students must hold them to these promises and likewise, hold them accountable.,• Queen’s has a reputation for being a school for the children of the upper middle class and the elite. However, students from all income brackets attend this University and many rely on financial aid, OSAP, and bank loans. Recognizing the diversity among students is important to ensuring equality in the community."},{"title":"Police enforce law in Ghetto","url":"/story/2005-09-13/editorials/police-enforce-law-ghetto/","date":"September 13, 2005","content":"Last week’s higher-than-average total of students charged with alcohol-related offences shows that students are being held accountable for their illegal actions, and rightly so. Students who live in the Ghetto or on campus residences are Kingston residents, and live under the same laws that every other permanent resident does.,If someone on the streets of Kingston is caught carrying open liquor or violating noise by-laws or is judged to be drunk to the point where they’re endangering themselves or others, they should be charged.,Since the double cohort, the number of students under the legal drinking age living away from home in residences has increased. It also comes as no surprise that as a result, the number of charges for underaged drinking among students has also risen. Students who choose to drink before they turn 19 are aware of the risk they’re running by engaging in illegal activity and shouldn’t be surprised if they’re caught by the police and charged.,That said, students should not be held to a higher standard of the law than permanent residents. Just as visible minorities shouldn’t be targeted by police by virtue of their skin colour, neither should students by virtue of their age, where they live or simply because they are students. Students are not above the law, but the fact that less than 100 out of 15,000 Queen’s students behaved badly last week shouldn’t mean that all students can be painted with the same brush.,The increased police presence in the Ghetto is a welcome change. While the Kingston Police may intend to have a greater presence during Homecoming and Orientation Weeks to come, let’s hope their presence remains constant throughout the year. A police presence would be particularly beneficial during times such as the winter break and Reading Week when fewer people are in the Ghetto and robberies of Ghetto houses increase.

The Harvard Crimson started publishing on Jan. 24, 1873. The Crimson beats out the Journal—yes, the very paper in your hands—for the title of oldest campus newspaper in North America by just 10 months. The first issue of the Journal didn’t appear till Oct. 25, 1873.,My problem is the Crimson was known as the Magenta till 1875, the year Harvard decided to change their school colour to something less flamboyant. But the Journal has always been the Journal since the very first day it was cranked out. Judge for yourself who really deserves the title of oldest campus newspaper.,My petty beef aside, it is appropriate that Harvard and Queen’s students both decided to start up a newspaper around the same time. Whether you’re in fourth year or are still getting used to the subtleties of residence life, you’ve probably already heard that time-worn saying: Queen’s is “the Harvard of the North.”,It’s a saying that implies that the quality of Queen’s education and the caliber of students ranks up there with the American Ivy League. If you’re in your fourth year, you’ve already decided your feelings about that assertion. If you’re in first year, you’ve got plenty of time to find out for yourself, for better or for worse.,The main thing to remember is that both Harvard and Queen’s students had the foresight 133 years ago to recognize a strong student newspaper has an important role to play on any vibrant university campus. Newspapers like the Crimson and the Journal exist to provide a forum for dialogue on campus about issues that uniquely affect students—from the ethics of university funding to the residence experience to how that campus sports team is doing.,Whether you choose to pick up the Journal on the way to your Tuesday or Friday class or not, it’s our hope at the Journal that students recognize the significance of maintaining a source on campus that’s an independent voice and whose top priorities include keeping students aware of issues that matter to them.,A campus newspaper needs two things in order to best serve its readership. First, it needs autonomy. Its articles, editorials and opinion pieces need to be decided by students, and not by any governing body at the University. The AMS, which publishes the Journal, is and can be involved only in the financial and policy side of the paper to guarantee readers are getting a newspaper free of vested interests. Second, it needs you, the reader, to get involved. The opinion pieces, articles and letters you write will make your voice heard, keep your fellow students informed and hold us editors accountable. For any of these purposes, we invite you to contact us.,In the end, do I really care whether the Magenta/Crimson or Journal is older? Not really. The fact both have been around for so long is really a testament to the vitality of student newspapers. But in the interests of the supposed Queen’s/Harvard rivalry, let’s keep the Journal one step ahead."},{"title":"Finding the high road","url":"/story/2004-09-28/editorials/finding-high-road/","date":"September 28, 2004","content":"My first experience of Israel involved a Sheraton hotel suite and two police officers carrying submachine guns.,Towards the end of the 11 years I spent living in Qatar, a suite in the Doha Sheraton where my dad worked was converted into a makeshift Israeli consulate. It was during the mid ’90s and I was just old enough to begin to understand the level of hatred many Arabs and Israelis feel for each other. I use the word “many” on the optimistic off chance I may someday meet a significantly large group of Arabs or Isralies who don’t secretly or overtly wish the other side would just disappear.,The 16 years I spent living in the Middle East taught me that the last thing anyone on either side of the Arab-Israeli conflict is interested in is dialogue.,Anyone who takes a strong stance on the conflict inevitably has to decide how to think about the murder of civilians, and the instinctual reaction is to downplay the killing of those you—even if only loosely—identify as sympathising with your enemy.,Last week, a number of groups, including Queen’s for Palestinian Human Rights, sponsored a talk by Uri Davis, a Jewish Palestinian scholar who describes Israel as an apartheid state.,I can think of at least one reason why QPHR jumped at the chance to sponsor Davis: Irshad Manji.,Last year Queen’s Hillel and a number of other campus groups helped bring Manji to Queen’s. I don’t think for a second that both speakers are equally credible—despite disagreeing with some of what Davis has to say, I find him to be far less of a shameless self-promoter. But the effect of bringing in each speaker was roughly the same. Hillel helped bring a speaker who could say ‘Look, I’m Muslim, but I’m criticizing Palestinians, therefore I must be credible.’ QPHR helped bring a speaker who could say ‘Look, I’m Jewish, but I’m criticizing Israel, therefore I must be credible.’ Both groups are well within their rights to do this, but the end result is, when I hear representatives from either group say they’re bringing these speakers to try and foster dialogue, I simply don’t believe them.,If these groups were truly interested in fostering dialogue, they would stop talking about how great dialogue is and start talking to one another. I’m tired of waiting for someone to remember that the high road does indeed exist—that it is possible to pick up the phone, call someone you disagree with and say ‘Let’s discuss this instead finding a roundabout way to lob the occasional cheap shot.’,So here’s the challenge to Hillel and QPHR: find some way to connect. Hold an open forum where you can argue with one another instead of getting outside speakers to do it on your behalf. Even if the whole thing deteriorates into a shouting match or popularity contest, you’ll at least have looked each other in the eyes. Even if you cooperate on a project completely unrelated to the Arab-Israeli conflict, it’s a good start. Hold a joint charity event for the Queen’s Food Bank, for example. Just give us jaded members of the Queen’s community reason to believe that you’re ready to do more than just subscribe to an antagonistic status quo."},{"title":"Fill ’er up","url":"/story/2005-09-16/editorials/fill-er/","date":"September 16, 2005","content":"My main squeeze is quite the catch.

When I’m studying and I take a sip from my travel mug, I feel transported to some café in Paris with Edith Piaf singing “La vie en rose” in the background. When I’m at home and I make coffee in my French press, there’s nothing more delightful.,Coffee is also a wonderful way to bring people together. Only at a coffee house would you be able to spend just a few dollars and sit there for hours. I’ve had some of the best conversations with my friends over coffee—it is the perfect opportunity to vent and spill your guts about anything and everything.,When I’m home, my dad and I have our usual coffee dates where I tell him what’s going on in my life. As we sip from our mugs, it’s more like we’re friends than parent and child and for some strange reason, I’m more at ease telling him that I still don’t know what I want to do or where I want to go with my life. And what’s stranger, he doesn’t seem to worry about me quite as much—at least not for that one moment.,Being a student has definitely encouraged what some of my friends may call my addiction to coffee. During exams, we all compare how many cups of coffee we’ve had that day, as if the number of cups directly translates to the amount of hours spent studying —although, if this were true, my GPA would be significantly higher.,When I look back on these years at Queen’s, I’m sure I’ll remember pulling all-nighters with my friends and making frequent runs to the Common Ground—not the exams we busted our butts studying for.,So let’s all raise our mugs and savour the moment."},{"title":"No books for Mrs. Becks","url":"/story/2005-09-13/editorials/no-books-mrs-becks/","date":"September 13, 2005","content":"This summer, I rekindled an old romance. I started reading for fun again.,When I was growing up, I would spend the majority of my summers reading. I loved getting lost in the exploits of the Baby-Sitters Club, Anne of Green Gables, or those adorable Sweet Valley Twins.,As the years progressed, I’m sorry to report that my book-loving began to dwindle. Reading became something that I had to do for school rather than a hobby.,This summer, I decided that it was time to revisit my old flame. Although my days of devouring Baby-Sitters Club novels were long gone, I found that my love affair with books was as steamy as ever. Over the summer, there were nights when I would rather have stayed home with my book than socialize. One of my favourite memories of the summer was the rainy weekend spent at a friend’s cottage when I read The Time Traveler’s Wife from cover to cover. Amazon.ca became my new obsession.,It was in the midst of this revived courtship that an article about Victoria Beckham, formerly Posh Spice of Spice Girls fame, caught my eye. In an interview to promote her new biography, Mrs. Beckham casually mentioned that she had never read a book in her life. I wasn’t sure what was worse: the fact that she openly admitted to never having read a book, or how she dropped this bombshell while promoting her own biography. I was dumbfounded, to say the least.,The more I thought about it, the more I realized that Posh’s comments are indicative of a greater trend within today’s society. We all know that beauty, tight bodies, and devastating wardrobes are necessities in the celebrity world, but lately, I’ve noticed that celebrity ignorance has become as fashionable as a Louis Vuitton handbag. You only need to watch five minutes of The Newlyweds to understand what I mean.,What bothers me the most isn’t the level of Victoria Beckham or Jessica Simpson’s intelligence. It’s the fact that these women are considered to be role models. These days, you can’t flip through the channels or walk by a magazine stand without seeing Jessica Simpson’s image, and Posh Spice was idolized by millions of young girls only a few short years ago. The question is, why have we chosen to revere these people? When did perky breasts and vapid smiles take precedence over talent and intelligence?,Maybe it was the fact that I had just reacquainted myself with the world of reading that Posh’s comments affected me so deeply. I couldn’t get past the idea that someone who is in a position of influence would choose to deny herself—and, by extension, those who admire her—the pleasure of being challenged, absorbed, or moved by a book. It seems somewhat backwards that Mrs. Beckham is considered to be part of the crème de la crème of our society.,It’s about time we stopped idolizing people for the wrong reasons. If you’re not enriching our world intellectually, artistically or in some generally intelligent fashion, you shouldn’t be in the spotlight. Ignorance isn’t a fashion accessory—it’s just plain stupid."},{"title":"Delving into human nature","url":"/story/2005-07-26/editorials/delving-human-nature/","date":"July 26, 2005","content":"Earlier this week, on a particularly sticky July afternoon, my friend Emily met me for lunch. It was one of those Maine days where the sun shines so brightly that the entire world seems illuminated; one of those days where even the most mediocre elements of your surroundings assume a certain glow. After we settled on cold Italian sandwiches underneath a patio umbrella right near the Portland waterfront, we hopped back in the hot car seats so that I could head back to work.,As we drove up Congress Street, I glanced over at the large stone church at the top of Temple Street. On a sign outside, a simple message was spelled out that has been seared into my mind ever since: “Human nature is a reason, but not an excuse.” I’m not someone who would fit comfortably within the realm of religious piety. But that statement—so simple, yet possessing so much gravitas—has been clinging to my mind like my sweaty shirt clung to my back. Not because the idea was original, and not because the phrasing was particularly impressive. But because out of nowhere, one of the oldest questions in the book was smacking my pupils in bold, white lettering. In the never-ending battle between mind and body, logic and emotion, reason and desire, who is the true victor?,Was the message intended to discourage sinful activity? Maybe. It was posted in front of a church after all, so that would be the easiest conclusion. But looking more closely, I realized the phrase doesn’t point a finger, elicit guilt, or take a moral high ground. Instead, it places the onus on the reader, sending a clear message of take responsibility for your own actions, doesn’t it?,This sort of an approach was a wise one on the part of the church. No hellfire, no brimstone, no obscure Biblical reference that would fly right over the heads of much of modern society. No Christian fundamentalist attitude repackaged in a modern wrapper. No Jesus leaning against the sign wearing hip-slung jeans and a polo shirt with a—gasp—popped collar. No typical robes and sandals, either.,Actually, no overt signs of Jesus anywhere on the message board. Instead, the statement settles more comfortably into the realm of general philosophy.,Trying to interpret a statement as open-ended as this one would fall prey to relativity by default, though. But the message in front of the church recognizes the inherent flaws in human character, and places responsibility upon us to do what we believe to be right, regardless of our own personal failings.,Human nature justifies nothing, regardless of circumstances. Actions rooted in human nature aren’t easily placed in the opposing hemispheres of right wrong, but they will always produce consequences, which is exactly what the sign serves to remind us of. I guess that means that in this never-ending struggle, consequence is the only real victor. I’ll have to try and remember that.,“Human nature is a reason, but not an excuse.” Food for thought."},{"title":"Polygraph, anyone?","url":"/story/2005-06-28/editorials/polygraph-anyone/","date":"June 28, 2005","content":"What is truth?” Pontius Pilate’s question seems particularly apt in light of recent political events. In an age where an increasingly disillusioned electorate tends to see politicians as liars and cheaters, the search for truth seems to have fallen by the wayside.,An obvious example is the lead-up to the Iraq war. The Bush administration’s claims regarding Hussein’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program were, we now know, not truthful. Whether they were actual lies, or simple misconceptions, is much harder to determine. What seems clear is that truthfulness was not at the forefront of the administration’s campaign of justification for regime change.,Those who were most outraged by Bush’s misleading statements were revitalized in their criticism when the Times London published the now notorious “Downing Street Memo” on May 1. The memo was written on July 23, 2002, some eight months before the Iraqi conflict began.,It suggests that Bush had already decided on military action, and that the facts and intelligence available were being “fixed” to fit the policy. It states quite clearly that the case against Hussein “was thin,” and that his WMD capabilities were less significant than those of Libya, North Korea or Iran.,It even admits that two of the three legal bases for regime change were not possible.,This past November President Bush was re-elected, even after it became clear that the famous stockpiles of WMD did not exist. His campaign was not significantly harmed by this rather obvious untruthfulness.,A mere three days after the publication of the potentially devastating Downing Street Memo, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was also re-elected.,On June 7, the two leaders addressed the media together at the White House. Much to my delight, when questioned about the allegation that the US altered intelligence around policy, Mr. Bush replied, “There’s nothing farther from the truth.”,All of this leads me to wonder to what extent Western electorates demand truth anymore. Does truth matter to us in politics, or have we come to expect to be deceived?,Canadian politics has seen its fair share of untruthfulness in recent months. The sponsorship scandal has left a cloud of corruption over the besieged Liberal government. However, after suffering a brief decline in support, the Liberals have re-established their lead.,The verdict is not in yet in Canada, though. With non-confidence votes continuing and Mr. Martin promising an election within 30 days of the conclusion of the Gomery inquiry, the Canadian electorate has an opportunity ahead of them to demand that the truth take a prominent place in Canadian politics. We have, thankfully, only squandered dollars, not lives.,It is time that we set an example. It is time that we demand better of our elected leaders. I am not suggesting defeating the Liberals outright in the next election, but neither should we passively let them off the hook. Though truth can be murky and hard to define, untruthfulness can be strangely transparent. We must stop turning the other cheek."},{"title":"George: 1, Me: 0","url":"/story/2005-05-24/editorials/george-1-me-0/","date":"May 24, 2005","content":"I’ll admit it: I’m a nerd. When I first saw the trailer for Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith on the big screen at the Gardiners Road theatre, I got, well, pretty excited. There may have been some drooling and flailing.,My non-nerdy housemate gave me her best look of disgust and told me to simmer down, but I couldn’t help myself. Finally! The chapter of evil we’ve all been waiting for!,When I say “we’ve all been waiting,” I don’t think I’m exaggerating that much. Like it or hate it or could care less, most of the Western world knows what Star Wars is.,There’s some guy, right, who’s somebody’s father? And the little green Yoda guy who talks backwards? Fear leads to something, I think. And there’s some Force, yeah.,So with all this Star Wars knowledge floating around, and all the excitement from the die-hards after merely seeing the trailer, is it really necessary for Lucas to pimp out his masterpiece six ways from Sunday? He’s the one who deserves the language the Conservatives have reserved for Belinda Stronach.,In the last few weeks, Star Wars characters could be seen everywhere in ads for candy, toys, drinks, burgers, cell phones, cereal and even racing cars. One moment, Yoda’s using the Force to steal a Pepsi; the next, Darth Vader is strangling the red M&M. Let’s not forget Master Lucas himself putting in an appearance on The O.C.,It’s enough to make a nerd cry. Is this really necessary? Do we have to see something that reminds us of Star Wars everywhere we turn?,Surely Lucas doesn’t need to squeeze any more coin out of his cash cow, and his movie doesn’t need any more publicity. His creation has become a cultural icon. So why this relentless bombardment of Star Wars propaganda? I loved watching Yoda bust a move fighting Count Dooku in the abominable Episode II, but he doesn’t make me want to drink Pepsi.,The preponderance of commercial exploitation was almost enough to make me boycott the movie. Almost. Come on, Obi-Wan and Anakin’s duel! I had to see it. And maybe that’s why Lucas released his universe to the advertising frenzy: he knew the fans would come in droves anyway.,That knowledge doesn’t make me any happier. I got played! I hate it when that happens.,And in a way, George is still pulling my puppet strings, since I’m only contributing to the media frenzy by writing this. In the last few weeks, Canadian newspaper pages have been dominated by two things: the kerfuffle in the House of Commons and Star Wars, Star Wars and the kerfuffle.,I’ve felt embarrassed many times this week. I was periodically embarrassed to be Canadian, thanks to our “dipstick” politicians, and I’m slightly embarrassed that I still went to see That Movie after the rampant commercialism.,But it was a pretty good flick. I guess you’ve won this round, George. You still owe me for the flaming piles of dog turd known as episodes I and II, and for that stupid Pepsi ad, but I don’t think I’ll ever get to collect."},{"title":"Journalism’s powers on trial","url":"/story/2005-07-26/editorials/journalisms-powers-trial/","date":"July 26, 2005","content":"New York Times journalist Judith Miller was sent to jail on July 6 for for refusing to testify to a grand jury inquiry into the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Miller was in contact with a source who had information about the leak, but will not reveal who it is. This inquiry has become a witch hunt and Miller’s arrest violates the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment which protects free speech and the free press.,The inquiry’s special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, has said, “Journalists are not entitled to promise complete confidentiality — no one in America is.” This threat to confidentiality compromises journalistic integrity.,Journalists report on issues the general public are not always aware of. Sources are an integral part of journalists’ ability to bring these controversial issues to light and many will often only disclose information on the condition of anonymity. Judith Miller is upholding her principles as a journalist by refusing to reveal the name of her source. Miller’s situation calls attention to the reality that a US federal shield law does not exist to protect journalists from being prosecuted for doing their jobs. This omission is not just an issue south of the border, either. In November 2004, the RCMP raided Ottawa Citizen reporter Juliet O’Neill’s home for information about Canadian Maher Arar, detained in Syria as a suspected terrorist. In December 2004, The Hamilton Spectator reporter Ken Peters was fined $31,600 for refusing to reveal his source for a story about a Hamilton nursing home.,It is an unfortunate comment on our society when journalists are being held responsible for the shortcomings of state. The Miller incident forces us to realize that without journalism, we would be ignorant of many of the actions and decisions of governments and what’s more, there would be no one to hold them accountable. If journalists are unable to guarantee confidentiality to their sources, very pertinent issues could remain dormant indefinitely."},{"title":"Task Force offers partial solution","url":"/story/2005-06-28/editorials/task-force-offers-partial-solution/","date":"June 28, 2005","content":"On June 15, the Principal’s Task Force on Community Relations released its 36-page report. The 13 recommendations respond to the ever-widening division between permanent residents and students, and attempt to resolve the general state of discontent and animosity. In order for any of the recommendations to be implemented successfully, both residents and students must recognize that the existing perception of students and residents as two separate camps will only hinder progress. Ultimately, we are all residents of Kingston.,Some recommendations are too vague and bureaucratic to foster real solutions. One recommendation calls for an elevation of “responsibility and accountability for community relations to a senior portfolio of the University,” while another outlines the creation of a “permanent ‘better community’ implementation team,” which would work to develop a plan to improve the quality of off-campus life.,The Task Force did make recommendations that could potentially lead to a drastic improvement to the living conditions of many students. Queen’s Apartment and Housing Service offers an Accommodation Listing Service (ALS) allowing landlords to advertise their properties for a fee; but as it stands now, the properties do not need to be approved or meet any criteria before being posted on the frequently-visisted ALS website. The Task Force recommends that Queen’s Apartment and Housing “extend the standards it sets for Queen’s-owned rental property to all properties listed on the ALS,” which includes a mandatory property inspection.,The Task Force has also recommended strengthening the “mandate and resources of AMS and SGPS for addressing non-academic discipline.” This is an encouraging sign of faith in the capabilities of students and the existing AMS Judicial System. It could also have been recommended that in addition to the Code of Conduct, the Judicial System procedure be publicized to both students and residents; there is often the misconception that non-academic discipline consists of merely a “slap on the wrist,” which definitely is not the case.,Homecoming, however, has been left under a shroud of ambiguity. With record attendance at the Aberdeen party last year, there are increasing concerns about safety and Kingston Police have said that they cannot deal with the growing crowds at Homecoming. While safety is a valid concern, the Administration, the Task Force and the Kingston Police must realize that the Aberdeen party, a student tradition, will not likely be thwarted,and they should seek ways to make Aberdeen safer, not to eliminate it.,Considering the report’s focus on Homecoming safety, it is surprising that off-campus student safety was not addressed. It is alarming that so many recommendations are being made to protect Kingston residents from noise and garbage, yet more serious issues have not been recognized.,Amidst increasing tension between the City and the students, this report addresses some very real issues. It has outlined the Administration’s commitment to students, and we must hold them accountable to fulfilling this commitment."},{"title":"Cancellation a poor decision","url":"/story/2005-09-13/editorials/cancellation-poor-decision/","date":"September 13, 2005","content":"After-Hours Childcare (AHC) is an important service to those who use it and before the AMS Board of Directors took the liberty of cancelling it, they should have come up with a firm solution instead of an ill-researched alternative that has left the 17 to 20 families who use the service with no inexpensive childcare provider to turn to.,In March, AHC became a grants-based program. The decision was made by AMS Council after Kelly Steele, VP (Operations), and the Andrew Graham, Director of Media and Services, reviewed AHC’s statistics. The numbers revealed that the program was used predominantly by faculty and members of the SGPS. In July, the AMS Board of Directors approved a decision by AMS Council to cancel the program completely.,It is true that, relatively speaking, only a small fraction of Queen’s students are affected by the cancellation of AHC. However, this does not mean that we can simply ignore these students nor does it mean there won’t be more students in the future who could need the service. Juggling the demands of schoolwork is difficult enough, but adding in the care of a young child makes it nearly impossible. It is particularly hard for student-parents with evening classes or who need extra study time.,In the past, prior to the grants-based program, AHC charged parents $3 per hour and $1 per hour for each additional child. These fees cater directly to students on tight budgets. Childcare centres in Kingston charge anywhere from $25.50 to $49.50 a day.,Operation of AHC began in 1995. Since 1999, it has lost a total of $60,000. The AMS contributes about 34 per cent of the funding necessary to operate the service, and students who choose to pay the $1 opt-outable contribute 14 per cent. Although a loss of $60,000 over five years is considerable, compare this to the $160,000 loss accumulated by the Queen’s Entertainment Agency (QEA) over a four-year period from 2000 to 2004. The QEA receives $21,000 each year from its $3 opt-outable fee. And in 2003 alone, Alfie’s Pub lost $180,000.,Cutting costs and being financially responsible is a concern for the AMS, but it should re-evaluate its priorities. If we can excuse the QEA’s or Alfie’s’ losses and fight to keep these services, why not keep the AHC?,The decisions made by the AMS are lasting, and before it starts deciding to cancel necessary programs like After-Hours Childcare, it should seriously consider the ramifications of these decisions and think through the solution it offers."},{"title":"Terry Fox Run still going strong","url":"/story/2005-09-20/editorials/terry-fox-run-still-going-strong/","date":"September 20, 2005","content":"Terry Fox’s legacy lives on. This past Sunday, Queen’s students, along with people across Canada and around the world, participated in the 25th annual Terry Fox Run. In 1977, when he was just 18 years old, Fox was diagnosed with bone cancer. While in hospital, he was moved by the patients around him to run his “Marathon,of Hope.” He started in Newfoundland in April 1980, running 42 kilometres a day for nearly five months before having to stop in Thunder Bay after cancer was discovered in his lungs. When it began, the “Marathon of Hope” didn’t garner very much attention, but Fox’s perseverance and dedication to his cause inspired the nation. In his journal during his run, he wrote: “If I died, I would die happy because I was doing what I wanted to do. How many people can say that? ... I want to set an example that will never be forgotten.” Many other worthy organizations have hosted events like the Terry Fox Run, but few have come near its success. Twenty-five years after Fox began his run, $360 million has been raised worldwide. Of every dollar raised, 87 cents go directly towards cancer research through the National Cancer Institute of Canada. Countries around the world also host the Terry Fox Run and money raised goes towards institutions recognized by the International Union Against Cancer in Geneva.,Record participation—approximately 600 people, up from last year’s tally of 370—at Jock Harty Arena is testament to the fact that Terry Fox’s name has become a part of not only cancer’s history, but this country’s history as well. He reminds us of what we are capable of when inspired to act. Fox died of cancer in 1981 when he was 22 years old, but he managed to accomplish so much in such a short period of time. As young people, we should take a cue from Terry Fox and realize how much we can achieve through sheer determination."},{"title":"No place for sexism in government","url":"/story/2005-05-24/editorials/no-place-sexism-government/","date":"May 24, 2005","content":"Thursday’s vote of confidence on the federal budget was a close call, with a final tally of 153 to 152. In the weeks leading up to the vote, the country saw the establishment of the “NDP deal” between Paul Martin and Jack Layton, while the Conservatives and the Bloc teamed up. In the end, the fate of the Grits came down to the decisions of independents Carolyn Parrish and Chuck Cadman, and the surprising defection of Belinda Stronach.,On Tuesday, in a press conference alongside Martin, Stronach announced she would be crossing the floor to take up the position of Human Resources Minister. She cited her apprehension at the direction the Conservatives are heading in their alignment with the separatist party as a reason for her move.,What is more surprising, however, is the Conservatives’ reaction to Stronach’s defection. Alberta Conservative Tony Abbott has been quoted and has subsequently apologized for calling Stronach a “little rich girl who is basically whoring herself out to the Liberals.” An Ontario Conservative has called Stronach a “dipstick.” These blatantly sexist comments are telling of the state of politics in Canada and the position of women in the Conservative party. Had the defection been made by a male Conservative, as was the case with Scott Brison in 2001, such commentary would never have taken place. Amidst these gendered attacks, it is also unfortunate that no female Tories have voiced concern and offence to such comments.,Harper has criticized Stronach for being ambitious and opportunistic. These comments are glaringly hypocritical on his part. His repeated attempts to topple the Liberal minority government suggest his motives are not completely independent of his own ambition of coming to power. Stronach’s motives are for her to know and we can only speculate they are a combination of personal ambition and concern at the emerging direction of the Conservative party.,In the end, when all is said and done, the Grits have survived another day. Although the House remains divided, hopefully the Conservatives will keep to their word of not trying to bring about another election any time soon and we’ll finally get some governance from all parties."},{"title":"The Aberdeen alternative","url":"/story/2005-09-16/editorials/aberdeen-alternative/","date":"September 16, 2005","content":"The University’s most recent attempt to thwart attendance at the Homecoming celebrations on Aberdeen Street is taking shape as a five-hour concert at Miller parking lot, featuring bands like Metric and Billy Talent. The details of a licensed area aren’t clear yet, but it is clear the University is spending a large amount of money to deter students from partying on Aberdeen Street. It has even gone so far as to request an exemption from the noise bylaw so that the concert can continue past the 11 p.m. cutoff time.,Considering the low attendance at last year’s “Crash the Ceilidh,” the concert is shaping up to be a huge improvement. The prospect of a free show with popular bands will definitely be more enticing to students than last year’s attempt.,However, the bands scheduled to play the Homecoming concert will not appeal to every student or alumnus and there will still be those who will choose to party on Aberdeen.,The concert won’t provide an atmosphere conducive to the mingling of students and alumni the way Aberdeen does. The sentiment of Homecoming is embodied by Aberdeen and it is a tradition that will be hard to break.,The University has organized the concert with concerns of Kingston residents in mind. That fact makes the negative community response to the concert all the more surprising. Former city councillor and Bagot Street resident Don Rogers expressed his objections to the concert. He commented to the Journal, “[The concert] is supposedly another Aberdeen Street debacle ... [but] why should residents have to suffer noise after midnight in their neighbourhood in order to prevent a lawless activity—illegal law breaking such as happened last year?” The University has asked for the exemption in order to keep students at the concert longer and consequently, away from residents’ houses.,Although the concert may not succeed in eclipsing Aberdeen, the Kingston community should appreciate that a good alternative is being offered and that the University is spending significant money to address the concerns of people who are not its primary constituents."},{"title":"Transgenderism still taboo","url":"/story/2005-09-16/editorials/transgenderism-still-taboo/","date":"September 16, 2005","content":"The issue of transgendered people is still sometimes as taboo in a community as intellectually progressive as Queen’s as it is in most parts of the globe. In California, two men were convicted this week of second-degree murder for killing a transgendered teen in October 2002. Michael Magidson and Jose Merel, who had been intimately involved with Eddie “Gwen” Araujo, strangled and tortured the teen after they discovered Araujo’s sexual orientation.,According to a recent Maclean’s article, transgender is “an umbrella term that describes people who are born of one biological sex but feel they belong to the other, or both, and don’t necessarily want sex reassignment surgery.” While progress has been made on campus about transgender issues, only last year was a transgendered washroom installed on the lower floor of the JDUC.,Although having transgender washrooms is a step in the right direction, more steps still need to be taken in terms of transgender awareness and education on campus. In light of the conviction of the teen’s killers, we as students must reassess our own ideas on gender and make efforts to understand what “transgenderism” means.,For most, university is a time of self-discovery and some students at Queen’s may be at the point of questioning their gender. Something like choosing which washroom to use, as simple as it may seem, is in fact no simple decision for transgender individuals and they should not be forced to make this decision. Facilities on campus such as the future Queen’s Centre should include transgender washrooms that are as accessible as gendered washrooms.,In the same Maclean’s article, it was reported that “The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV classifies transgenderism and transsexualism as disorders (in much the same way homosexuality was considered a mental illness before it was de-listed in 1973) ... .” The fact that even healthcare professionals are having difficulty understanding transgendered people shows how much further we as a society have to go.,As students at Queen’s, and future citizens and leaders for a global society, we should make every effort to not only to accept but also to understand transgendered people."},{"title":"Katrina relief concert raises controversy","url":"/story/2005-09-09/editorials/katrina-relief-concert-raises-controversy/","date":"September 9, 2005","content":"On Sept. 2, during NBC’s Concert for Hurricane Relief to benefit victims of Katrina hip hop musician Kanye West diverted from his teleprompt script to make some very pointed and unexpected comments. West expressed his anger and disappointment in the Bush administration’s response to the disaster, even going so far as to say, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.”,Although West’s remarks were untimely and his choice of words could have been better, his sentiments highlight the existing racial divide in the South and point to a greater systemic problem in the United States.,The media’s portrayal of the tragedy illustrates how race has become a divisive issue in the chaotic aftermath of the hurricane. A recent photo produced by the Associated Press shows a black man wading through chest-deep water with a case of Pepsi and a garbage bag in tow; the accompanying caption said the man had been “looting” a grocery store. In a similar photo by AFP/Getty Images, a white man is described as “finding” food and other goods. The difference between the captions has received immense criticism from the public.,The fact that many of the most vulnerable residents of New Orleans were black is a serious societal issue rather than a reflection of Bush’s personal sentiments. Katrina officially landed in New Orleans on Aug. 30, but federal convoys carrying food and other necessities did not reach the ravaged city until Sept. 2. This delayed response has outraged people all over the United States. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called on politicians to “Get off your asses.” What’s worse is that unlike Kanye West’s remarks, Hurricane Katrina was not unexpected. For years, experts have questioned the strength of the resources available to withstand a hurricane of Katrina’s magnitude. In March 2004, the former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), James Lee Witt, told Congress he was “extremely concerned that the ability of our nation to prepare for and respond to disasters has been sharply eroded.” Nations around the world have pledged their help and support, but they can neither send their planes of food and supplies nor can they dispatch medical workers until the U.S. has given them the okay. This is yet another complication in the slow process of recovering what remains of a city in shambles. The  Globe and Mail reported that “many of the nations offering aid to the United States after hurricane Katrina—including India, South Korea, Japan and Germany—said Wednesday that they are still waiting to hear back from Washington on whether their donations had been accepted.”,Although Congress has approved $10.5 billion in aid, critics are quick to remind Bush of his efforts to decrease funding to programs guarding against natural disasters in order to pay for tax cuts and the war in Iraq. Before the hurricane hit, a mere $4.7 million were reluctantly spent on improving the levees holding back Lake Pontchartrain, which Katrina stormed through."},{"title":"Don’t Charge Moore","url":"/story/2004-07-27/editorials/electionscanadachargemoore/","date":"July 27, 2004","content":"A fourth-year Queen’s student wants Elections Canada to charge American filmmaker Michael Moore with violating the Canada Elections Act.,Kasra Nejatian, Comm ’05, claims Moore violated section 331 of the Act, which states that no one who is not a Canadian citizen or resident may “during an election period, in any way, induce electors to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate.” On June 19, while Moore was in Toronto promoting his new film, Fahrenheit 9/11, he publicly encouraged Canadians not to vote for the Conservative Party because of their positions on social issues and the war in Iraq.,While Nejatian has every right to pursue this matter in court, it seems that his efforts amount to little more than a publicity stunt. Moore should have the right to publicly express his political views and should not be charged by Elections Canada.,It seems hypocritical of Nejatian that he is attempting to charge Moore under a law that Nejatian himself openly says is unjust and should never have been established in the first place.,Further, it is unfortunate that Nejatian has chosen to use such juvenile language in his characterization of Moore; on his website—chargemoore.com—Nejatian calls Moore a “jackass.” This kind of language does not advance Nejatian’s cause and serves only to undermine his credibility.,More importantly, the election law is simply unjust. It is dangerously vague and possibly inconsistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The law was created in 2000 and Nejatian’s challenge represents the first time anyone has attempted to have charges laid under this particular clause. Thus, any court ruling on the matter—if it should come to that—will be beneficial because it would at least establish a legal precedent clarifying exactly what the law permits.,Hopefully, if the courts are brought into the matter, they will rule in favour of free speech. Healthy democracy requires open political debate and the free exchange of ideas. Democracy in Canada will not be made stronger by restricting the fundamental right to free speech."},{"title":"The return of Alfie’s","url":"/story/2004-09-21/editorials/return-alfies/","date":"September 21, 2004","content":"Once again, Alfie’s has been renovated. But while previous attempts to solve the bar’s financial woes by throwing more money toward renovations have consistently backfired, this year’s AMS executive is betting it has what it takes to finally turn Alfie’s into an atmosphere worth attending.,It is premature to reach any certain conclusions about the fate of Alfie’s in the upcoming school year. However, last Friday’s re-opening seemed to be a successful night for the bar.,Alfie’s drew a fairly large crowd last Friday, something that hasn’t happened in a long while. Inside, the bar has dropped the sports bar image it projected last year and now boasts more of a lounge atmosphere. Appropriately, martinis are now served and are actually pretty good.,Alfie’s would be wise to promote Friday nights in particular as good nights to spend at the campus bar. Stage’s recently decided to make every Friday night an all-ages event, which will likely provide an incentive for many upper-year students to go anywhere but Stage’s that night. If Alfie’s plays its cards right, it may be able to tap into a sizable market by selling itself as a good upper-year bar on Fridays. However, it should also be careful not to return to the past, when it trapped itself into being a one-night-a-week-only bar. If Alfie’s is to succeed, it must be popular for more than four hours a week.,One concern about the new renovations is that it may now be more difficult for QEA to book good live rock bands given the bar’s new lounge atmosphere. It is uncertain if large numbers of concert-goers will have a good time rocking out in an atmosphere reminiscent of the Tango.,At any rate, students will no doubt benefit by having one more choice available to them. What remains to be seen, however, is how many of them will actually choose Alfie’s."},{"title":"Regulating violent dogs","url":"/story/2004-09-14/editorials/regulating-violent-dogs/","date":"September 14, 2004","content":"Ontario’s Attorney General recently announced the province will take legislative action in an attempt to reduce the number of violent dog attacks. Although past efforts have focused exclusively on pit bulls, new efforts are expected to encompass all dangerous dogs. Still, pit bulls seem to be receiving the most attention and it is possible that Ontario may soon ban pit bulls altogether.,Tougher legislation on dangerous dogs is needed now. Violent and uncontrollable dogs have killed or seriously injured several people in the last few years.,Such legislation on dangerous dogs has been proven to be effective. Winnipeg introduced a pit bull ban in 1990 and witnessed a significant drop in the number of incidents resulting in serious human injury or animal death—there were 28 such cases in 1989, but zero this year.,Besides, government already regulates or prohibits the ownership of many dangerous animals so why shouldn’t similar rules apply to pit bulls?,Dangerous dog legislation should also focus on the duties of the dog owners. Negligent owners of violent dogs must be held legally responsible for the actions of their pets. Although violent dog behaviour can be attributed in some cases to the dog’s genetics, it is clear the animal’s environment also helps to shape its behaviour.,It is reasonable to assume that owners who abuse or mistreat their dogs are aware they are creating an accident waiting to happen and to conclude that they should be held responsible for their abusive actions. The onus must fall on the dog owners to monitor the behaviour of their pets and to ensure that the pets do not pose a public threat.,The goal of the new legislation is to protect the public, not to deny dog owners their rights. Given the success in Winnipeg, it seems likely that an effective and appropriate solution can be found for Ontario."},{"title":"Football & Cold Beer","url":"/story/2004-09-10/editorials/football-and-cold-beer/","date":"September 10, 2004","content":"Beer will now be served at Queen’s home football games.,Campus activities commissioner Dave Homuth has arranged for a designated area to be established right next to Richardson Stadium where students will be able to purchase and drink beer. Although students will not be able to drink beer in Richardson Stadium, the designated area is expected to provide a good view of the football field and seat approximately 1,650 people.,Selling beer at football games is a great idea that is likely to be popular among students. Football games have not seen particularly high student attendance in recent years and the availability of beer may help to increase ticket sales. As long as students drink responsibly, there is nothing wrong with them coming for the beer and staying for the football.,Also, permitting beer in a designated and legal area is likely to reduce the number of students who attempt to illegally sneak alcohol into Richardson Stadium.,It is also possible that if campus football does see an increase in attention from students then perhaps there could be a trickle down effect whereby other campus sports receive more attention too.,In other words, anything that helps to promote school spirit is always a step in the right direction.,But perhaps the best part of this idea is that the profits from the sale of beer will go to help fund varsity sports at Queen’s. Many of these sports have had to cope with significant budget cuts in the last few years and will no doubt benefit from the additional funds. At the very least, allocating the money for varsity sports seems a much better use of the cash than just making the bottom line of Alfie’s slightly less red, which appears to have been the most probable alternative.,Naturally, there will be an onus on students not to abuse the privilege. While football games provide a great forum to be loud and boisterous, it is important that students refrain from inappropriate behaviour while they are drinking. The idea of permitting beer at football games was created rather quickly and can certainly be revoked just as easily."},{"title":"Say no to sweatshops","url":"/story/2004-09-28/editorials/say-no-sweatshops/","date":"September 28, 2004","content":"Officially licensed Queen’s clothing is a popular commodity around campus. Sadly, the University is not doing all it can to ensure that none of its officially licensed clothing is made in illegal sweatshops. Although the University’s current policy requires licensees to provide the University with a list of their suppliers and manufacturers, the University doesn’t currently have the resources to monitor the working conditions of the organizations identified by the licensees.,In other words, there are no existing safeguards that can guarantee that officially licensed Queen’s clothing is not produced in illegal sweatshops.,No Sweat is a non-governmental organization committed to eradicating illegal sweatshops and promoting safe working conditions around the world. The Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) has officially endorsed No Sweat polices, as have the University of Alberta, Dalhousie, Guelph, Laurentian, McMaster, Memorial, Montreal, Toronto, Waterloo and Western Ontario.,Queen’s has not yet committed itself to No Sweat, but has been working toward that goal for at least a year. Why the process is taking so long is a mystery. More importantly, that such measures were not taken years ago is a travesty.,Queen’s should only grant clothing licenses to suppliers that fully disclose how their products are made and that meet Canadian labour laws. Any business that fails to do so should be immediately removed from the list of corporations with which Queen’s does business.,Queen’s boasts it is “preparing leaders and citizens for a global society.” It is time the University puts its money where its mouth is. Until it does, it may be up to the students to put pressure on the University to make these imperative changes. After all, it was almost exclusively because of student activism that the Common Ground decided a few years ago to serve only fair trade coffee. Students should be proud of that achievement, but should also not be complacent—their work is not yet done.,The price of apathy is too costly."},{"title":"Toronto police go too far","url":"/story/2004-09-24/editorials/toronto-police-go-too-far/","date":"September 24, 2004","content":"Toronto’s police chief Julian Fantino recently proposed the city police establish a fingerprint database of people who have been charged—but not convicted—of certain serious crimes, such as those involving violence, sexual offenses and weapons.,Though Fantino is adamant about the merits of the policy, it has been met with fierce opposition from others. Ontario’s information and privacy commissioner, Ann Cavoukian, called the policy an “unreasonable infringement of the privacy rights of individuals.,“Such changes would also be contrary to commonly accepted principles underlying the presumption of innocence that exist in our criminal justice system.”,Cavoukian is exactly right. The policy is unnecessary and represents a clear violation of the principle that all people are innocent until proven guilty. Toronto police should not proceed with the database.,The database has the potential to be the beginning of a very slippery slope. It essentially puts the onus on the citizen to prove his or her innocence rather than placing the onus where it belongs: on the courts and police to prove guilt. Further, officers who perceive that they can get away with overstepping the jurisdiction may potentially abuse the database. Recent developments in the past few years—such as the widespread allegations of racial profiling—have already shown that Toronto police are hardly the finest force in the land.,The whole idea of a database is indicative of Fantino’s style of policing, which is known to be somewhat heavy-handed and stern. Fortunately, Fantino is on his way out and hopefully his soon-to-be selected successor will be more respectful of the rights of the innocent.,Everyone wants to live in a safe community, but a fingerprint database of the innocent is not an appropriate way to pursue that end. Although the database may occasionally be useful, the ends simply do not justify the draconian means. The potential for abuse is too large and outweighs the potential benefits."},{"title":"An apolitical rolling stone","url":"/story/2004-09-21/editorials/apolitical-rolling-stone/","date":"September 21, 2004","content":"I have a confession that one of my t-shirts makes equally well: I love Bob Dylan.

I will always prefer the poetry of Another Side of Bob Dylan and Blonde on Blonde to the polity of “The Times They Are A-Changin’.” The racism and political injustices Dylan decries are inaccessible to me. He brings them out descriptively to effect change, but that change has passed, or not passed, depending on whom you ask.,The irony of ranting against politics in a political forum like a newspaper is not lost on me. But ultimately, I’d rather attend to my mysteries than my supposed responsibilities. I’d rather read and write poetry, listen to music, make music, self-investigate and suffer in ways that Wolf Blitzer will never need to understand, but I will.,I haven’t been to too many dinner parties—my orange hair and its tendency to grow long offends some—but political discussion like CNN is a sedative for me. I’m not saying that we should recite verses of Blake for our serious fare. Far be it for me to establish your menu, I’m just giving you a peek at mine. I realize that there is usually a balance between trivial and serious discussion—one makes us laugh, while the other can help us know something of our companions through revealing something of ourselves. I just wish we didn’t automatically take the trivialities of politics so seriously.\t,Politics, trivial? Somebody get this boy a liberal education. Can he be so narrow-minded so as not to see that there are real injustices in the world that humanity needs to resolve and that are more important than the trite lines of longing he wrote about the girl that sold him a beer at the QP?,All right, I reject the ancient Hindu scripture that “Evil does not exist.” The suffering of others affects me—though never as much as my own—for I don’t believe that there is a way to quantify anguish.,I am humanist insofar as my aim in life is to live it. It’s not too noble and it will make my epitaph rather ironic: “His aim was to live life, until he died.” Machine politics seems to interfere with my endless pursuit of self-discovery, in the same way that sports does—and no, this is not my resignation letter. It’s just that part of me wishes that people would take themselves as seriously as they take politics.,If you are ready to sling arrows labeled “hypocrite” at me, I am ready to bend them. By attending to my contradictions, I see the value of accepting rather than despairing, which means accepting all and despairing none.,I endeavour not to be deceived as Dylan once was by the black-and-white terms that politics is usually couched in.

It’s hardly surprising then that the service’s largely fixable flaws become most noticeable during this time.,QCARD is far more inaccessible than it needs to be. For a service that is essential to every single student at this University, it is inoperative far too often.,QCARD should be consistently accessible every day of the week and at times later than eight at night. Many students lead busy lives and are sometimes unable to find time to use QCARD during its hours of operation. It is understandable why services that require human interaction are limited to standard business hours, but QCARD is a website. Most websites are accessible at any time of day and on any day of the week. QCARD shouldn’t be an exception.,Another problem with QCARD is its organizational structure. Users who wish to view their fee account information, for example, are directed to a window that does not permit them to return to the QCARD main menu. Instead, users must exit QCARD entirely and log on again. This is particularly frustrating when users then find that they can no longer log back onto QCARD because the server is all of a sudden too busy.,Some may claim that the fee account information dead end is a safety feature so that those who use public computers are not unknowingly allowing others to access their private information. However, the portion of QCARD that displays other private information, such as addresses and phone numbers, does not lead users into a dead end. In this regard, QCARD is inconsistent for unclear reasons.,Still, for all its faults, QCARD could be much worse. Some other universities require students to register for courses over the phone by pushing numbers on a touchtone while struggling with an automated voice.,However, the argument that something could be worse is not an excuse for why it is needlessly flawed. Some of QCARD’s flaws can be appropriately addressed with only minimal work on the part of ITS.,The University should do more to explain to students why QCARD works the way it does and why QCARD’s fixable flaws are not being fixed."},{"title":"Communication 101","url":"/story/2004-09-17/editorials/communication-101/","date":"September 17, 2004","content":"My sixteen-year-old sister tells me I should just let it go and lol. That’s when I get worried. I get worried that MSN messenger is a problem that is seeping into our every waking moment.,But before I explain why messaging is bothering me so much I have to make it clear that I understand its benefits.,It is a great way to organize a night out or rides. It’s also a cost-efficient way to stay in touch with family members and friends outside the 613 area code.,But in my humble opinion, this is all it is good for. I believe MSN messenger is creating a serious emotional and social disconnect for our generation.,The first problem is names. Everyone has at least 10 people on their list who change their name no less then a million times a day. There are also those people who use “profound” quotes as their names. These quotes never make me stop and contemplate life. Then there are those people who change their names to every event, party and social function they are attending. They want everyone to know how fun and popular they are, reminding you that if you want to spend a minute with them you better message them asap, before they find something better to do.,These names that replace our own are like a well-planned outfit; something we put on in hopes that people understand the image we are trying to portray.,The second problem is time. A conversation over the computer yields a certain pause between messages. This allows someone messaging his or her crush to carefully plot out an answer to a question that he or she might pose. It’s not a reactionary answer; rather an effort to answer in the way that they might think is most favourable to the other person. At the same time they can confer with a friend over the phone, or better yet over MSN, what their answer should be.,The third problem is lack of emotion. Now I know some of you are saying “What about emoticons?” If you believe that human beings are capable of only 20 emotions, one of which is a yellow head with sunglasses, you have become a slave to MSN and cannot be saved. Messages, with no intonation or tone, lose all meaning.,The fourth, and biggest, problem is the absence of physical interaction. Thousands of people sit alone in their rooms and type out a convoluted image and a fine-tuned conversation. This now passes for social interaction. I know many people who have had full-blown arguments with their significant others—and made up—all over MSN. When they see each other the next day they don’t talk about it, the fight has evaporated into cyber-space.,I know I might be taking this problem to an extreme, but the speed at which people have become dependent on these tools of technology is cause for concern. If it continues, one day we will never talk one-on-one with each another but rather construct ourselves into names on a list—limited to 20 emotions—and be all alone."},{"title":"Confronting Genocide","url":"/story/2004-09-10/editorials/confronting-genocide/","date":"September 10, 2004","content":"On July 22, the United States Congress passed a resolution that used the term “genocide” to describe the situation in Sudan during the last several months.,In the realm of international law, the term “genocide” carries significant weight. If the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that used the term to describe the situation in Sudan then the international community, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, would be legally obligated to take all appropriate measures to stop the genocide.,In Samantha Power’s A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, the author shows how the Clinton Administration in 1994 took deliberate and repeated measures to refrain from using the term genocide to describe what was then taking place in Rwanda. The administration did so precisely because it did not want to involve itself in Rwanda, given its disastrous results in Somalia one year earlier.,However, the international community’s response to the current genocide in Sudan is different from its response to the genocide in Rwanda 10 years ago because the main opposition to outside intervention in Sudan comes not from the United States but from the other great powers at the United Nations.,Russia, China and France have each stated that outside intervention is not their preferred course of action for addressing Sudan. That’s why when the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1556 on July 30 the term “genocide” was not used once.,Now I don’t believe for one moment that the primary force behind American foreign policy is an ethical concern for international law. Mention “September 11” to the people of Chile and they might think of the year 1973 before they think of the year 2001. The United States has done some terrible things.,However, any honest observer will also agree that the foreign policies of Russia, China and France are not primarily guided by ethical principles either. Perhaps the most likely explanation for why Russia, China and France oppose intervention in Sudan is that they all import oil from the country and do not want to do anything that might upset their profitable status quo. I suspect that’s partly why they opposed the U.S.-led war on Iraq.,If the world is to confront the genocide in Sudan, what is needed first is for Russia, China and France to put aside their differences with the United States and join it in calling a spade a spade.,Right now, there is genocide taking place in Sudan and the United States is the only major power honest enough to admit it and prepared to take action to prevent it. However, it will almost certainly not act alone. Not too long ago, the United States acted unilaterally to destroy a murderous regime and received very little gratitude from the world for its sacrifice.,If Russia, China and France will not swallow their national pride and join with the United States to form a united front against the genocide in Sudan then world history will once again record how the entire world watched genocide happen and did nothing to confront the horror."},{"title":"Stick a fork in me","url":"/story/2004-09-14/editorials/stick-fork-me/","date":"September 14, 2004","content":"After a sleepy summer in Kingston, school has once again begun and I don’t think I’ve ever been so bummed out.,I’ve tried to talk myself out of this funk.

But nothing seems to work.,See, I’ve been feeling a little abandoned these days. A good number of my friends have graduated from university and are heading out to the real world. Incidentally, they’ve all moved to Toronto, which seems to be where all of the hip, young graduates flock to seek their fortune. One friend is writing for a hip music magazine. Another is enrolled at a prestigious film school. Still another is off to teach in Asia. They’re moving into quaint apartments in the Annex, started going out for sushi and settling into seriously committed relationships. They are, in short, all making a go of it in the post-graduate adult world.,And me? I’m going through the same rotation of classes, getting ready to write the same papers, going to the same bars to see the same bands and getting drunk on Labatt 50 in my bedroom while Devo’s cover of “Satisfaction” sputters in the background. As for a significant other, I feel the Hidden Cameras make an uncannily accurate observation when they sing: “music is my boyfriend.” I mean, it’s okay. Queen’s has been rather good to me, overall. I’ve dug a little niche for myself and I’ve met many charming people.,And I do realize that the student life is an undoubtedly ideal situation when compared to the drudge and responsibility of the real world. However, I feel my graduated friends have suddenly become useful, interesting adults in the span of four months, while my time of usefulness at Queen’s is very quickly approaching its end.,Although I don’t want this to be one of those editorials that self-deprecatingly admits to “still having a lot to learn” at the end of university, the truth is, four years later I still feel pretty irresponsible. As I write this, I still have no idea when or where my first class of the day is and I can’t find my wallet.,I suppose we can ape the mannerisms of “adulthood” all we want and still have no idea what we’re doing. And yes, the grass is always greener on the other side, et cetera. And yes, I should make the most of my fourth year and not pre-emptively write it off before it’s even begun. But I look at the first-years with their generally infectious enthusiasm and I simply feel kinda old. I used to get excited about starting school. Now, I’m merely comfortable with it.,And while comfort is a pleasant enough sensation, I figure that once you’ve lost your verve and excitement for something, it’s time to move on.,Forgive the cliché, but with eight months left, I can safely say it’s already time to stick a fork in me.

About 95 per cent of you will be below the legal drinking age when you get here, and that’ll suck. Not because drinking is a cornerstone of post-secondary life—far from it—but because it means most of you will have to spend a year or two stuck in the politics and misinformation-fuelled limbo that somehow hands you control over every aspect of your life except whether you can legally celebrate with a pint after your midterm.,In light of this province’s current educational and social framework, this just doesn’t make sense.,Higher drinking age proponents often argue that the 19th-birthday cutoff is meant to synchronize with the driver licensing age and reduce teen drunk driving. True, a disproportionate number of impaired-driving crashes are caused by young drivers, but mainly due to teenagers’ inexperience behind the wheel. In fact, roadside stop statistics show teens are much less likely than their parents to drive with any alcohol in their systems, which suggests graduated licensing conditions and the constant flood of public service ads are the heavier casks in the policy cellar.,Besides, there’s not much evidence that legal drinking ages, in and of themselves, affect anything at all.,One 1995 study of American and European 16-year-olds showed little correlation between the legal drinking age and young people’s drinking patterns.,Closer to home, an Ontario study conducted in 1981, two years after the legal drinking age was raised to 19 from 18, showed virtually identical results.,In other words, if the province’s graduating teens want to drink, they will.,But since their September destination is the independent world of university or college, they’re likely to want the corresponding adult privilege of choosing where to hang out, whether they drink there or not.,And 20 per cent of Ontario Grade 12 students told the Ontario Student Drug Use survey last year that they hadn’t consumed any alcohol in the previous year, suggesting that the number who drink rarely and responsibly is much higher.,But despite this and other evidence that the educational approach to drinking choices has more kick than the legislative one, Ontario’s alcohol policy hasn’t kept pace with its changes to the secondary system. University staff are still wasting time and money trying to devise booze-proof social activities for underage frosh, while the University’s brand-new all-ages program was virtually cancelled last year because it was too hard for staff in crowded campus pubs to keep beer out of minors’ hands.,A toast to fixing this tedious situation by lowering the legal drinking age to 17.

Either way, I haven’t seen Jim Henson’s Muppets in the same light since.,The fiasco began when a high school magazine two friends and I edited ran a photo of Miss Piggy attached to an article penned by my best friend.,This was not a mistake. The layout editor had, in a burst of creativity, decided to bestow an alternative identity on every writer.,But our Miss Piggy was not tickled pink. It was a conspiracy, she charged. We had purposely sought to mortify her and trod her name through the mud.,Unfortunately, the evidence weighed against us.,First and foremost, she insisted we had personally selected the loud-mouthed prima donna for her photo with malicious intent—I actually thought the pearl-loving pig was a babe! Second, her article was printed on the page directly beside an article I had written. Go figure my photo would be a buxom cartoon bunny. Third, by titling her article “D.E.C.A.

I was none too impressed by the event and unhappy that some of our common friends never believed the incident was unintentional. Luckily, the principal realized the whole affair was ridiculous and dropped the notion of suspension.,But things had changed, and once my urge to call out “Suey!” when I saw her in the halls subsided, I mainly felt sorry for her.,We had been friends since grade six, yet I can only presume it was humiliation that drove her to instantly turn the three of us into scapegoats. The matter was trivial, yet she must have felt that failing to take action would have made her a laughing stock. It’s precisely that self-conscious, obsessive concern about the opinions of others with which I take issue.,I’ve heard that in your lifetime, only eight people will ever really love you. While this sounds harsh, ponder this: after your funeral, how many people will think about you even once a month in the following years?,My point is straightforward. While our daily interactions with others are characterized by a slew of tacit judgments, most are fleeting.

Some NGOs, such as the Canadian Jewish Congress, argue that the network shouldn’t even be allowed in Canada and allege the network broadcasts anti-Semitic content.,Those familiar with Al-Jazeera can reasonably question the network’s ability to report news accurately and objectively. Still, Al-Jazeera should be allowed to broadcast in Canada and Canadians should be allowed to decide for themselves whether the network is worth watching.,In its ruling, the CRTC has attempted to strike a delicate balance. Unfortunately, their decision may satisfy few.,Supporters of Al-Jazeera may be frustrated by the choice to partially censor the network while opponents may have wanted nothing less than unconditional prohibition. It is not clear if there is a large Canadian market for a watered-down version of Al-Jazeera.,Last, there might be a double standard in play. Western media occasionally broadcasts content that could be reasonably interpreted as offensive to the Arab world and media regulators seem less pro-active in their efforts to prohibit such content. Perhaps the Canadian reaction to Al-Jazeera has more to do with culture shock than with a neutral effort to standardize Canadian media.,The politics of censorship is a difficult subject. The politics of the Middle East is even more challenging. By creating a Canadian-filtered version of Al-Jazeera, the CRTC has attempted to establish common ground on an explosive issue.

To those who have never participated, the event may appear strange and unappealing, but to those in the Faculty of Applied Science, the event is nothing less than a rite of passage.,The Faculty of Applied Science has a culture unlike any other at this University.,No other faculty drenches themselves in purple from head to toe during Frosh Week, no other faculty takes as much pride in their jackets—affectionately referred to as Golden Party Armour, and no other faculty seems to match the engineers’ tight-knit sense of community.,The Greasepole is a large part of that culture and has a long tradition at Queen’s. Unfortunately, it seems as though that tradition may be undergoing significant changes. If that happens, it will be a shame.,The administration, as well as many student leaders, have always been concerned with student safety, which itself is entirely appropriate, indeed expected. However, the difficulty of the Greasepole is a large part of its appeal. The more difficult the challenge, the more satisfying it is to overcome it.,Throughout Frosh Week, upper-year students tease and order around the frosh. The Greasepole, though meant primarily for the Applied Science frosh, is also meant to unite Applied Science students of all years in a few hours of difficult, but good-spirited fun. Because the Greasepole was completed so quickly this year, that didn’t happen the same way it has in past years.,Safety is very important, but if the Greasepole becomes just another watered-down event like almost everything else in Frosh Week, then it will lose its meaning.,If changes are made to make the event safer, it shouldn’t be at the expense of having a good time."},{"title":"Canada’s Olympic woes","url":"/story/2004-09-10/editorials/canadas-olympic-woes/","date":"September 10, 2004","content":"Canada’s performance at the summer Olympics in Athens was one of its worst in recent memory. From track and field to rowing to swimming, many Canadian athletes who were expected to do well fell short of their potential.,A leading cause of Canada’s Olympic woes involves money. For a country as wealthy as Canada, government funding of athletes is surprisingly low. This point was clearly brought home when Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, singled out Canada for its lackluster level of funding.,Much more should be done to encourage athletics from a young age, particularly in sporting events featured in the Olympics. Sports like discus throwing or pole vaulting are almost entirely absent from elementary and high school gym classes. No wonder Canada produces so few Olympic caliber athletes in these events.,At the University level, Canada has nothing comparable to the United States where athletic scholarships are widely available and provide financial incentives for athletes to continue their training. It may thus be more difficult than it needs to be for Canadian athletes to support their livelihood while they train.,Canada should also establish more elite funding for top athletes. Australia will almost certainly testify to the success of such targeted funding. Australia’s medal count in Athens last month, as well as in Sydney four years ago, was simply phenomenal and the Australian government is certain that their high level of funding for athletes was a leading cause of their country’s success. Perhaps Canada may wish to consider adopting a model of athletic funding similar to the one currently employed in Australia.,Canada has hosted the Olympics twice before—Montreal in 1976 and Calgary in 1988. Incidentally, Canada did not win a single gold medal in either city. Vancouver will host the Olympics in 2010.,If Canada wishes to safely avoid an embarrassing three-peat, the government should seriously consider granting a significant increase in the level of funding for Olympic athletes."},{"title":"Foremsky still a threat","url":"/story/2004-09-14/editorials/foremsky-still-threat/","date":"September 14, 2004","content":"Philip Foremsky, a man who pled guilty to groping, sexually assaulting and robbing six women near the York University campus four years ago, was recently granted a statutory release from a Correctional Centre to a half-way house in Kingston.,In the last few weeks, photos of Foremsky have been published in various media outlets in an effort to alert citizens of his appearance and presence in the community. Although some might argue that this is a violation of his right to privacy, in this particular case, the public’s right to safety is more important.,The details of Foremsky’s statutory release are significant. He will now be housed in a correction centre located only 10 minutes away from campus and will be allowed to leave the centre and interact with the general public as long as he is escorted at all times by an officer. Corrections Canada apparently considers this to be an appropriate compromise, but the thought of Foremsky walking around campus is quite frightening.,However, there are only two cities other than Kingston that Foremsky could have been sent to—Hamilton and Toronto—and each also house a university. Thus, it is unavoidable that Foremsky will be near a university.,The most troubling part about Foremsky’s statutory release is that Corrections Canada still considers him to be a high risk to reoffend. Although he entered treatment programs in prison, he performed poorly.,On one occasion, prison officials found drugs, homemade alcohol and money in his prison cell.,Most importantly, Foremsky was sentenced to prison for five years but will serve only about two-thirds of that time. Given the horrible nature of his crimes and his questionable conduct in prison, it is unclear why he deserves to be released in this way at this time.,In theory, criminals can be rehabilitated. Those criminals who have served their time in prison have certain rights that must be upheld once they are released. However, it is debatable whether or not this particular criminal has actually been rehabilitated and deserves the privileges he has been granted.,Corrections Canada has made a controversial decision in granting Foremsky a statutory release. If Foremsky proves to be undeserving of such a privilege, Corrections Canada should bear some of the blame."},{"title":"Kofi Annan speaks out","url":"/story/2004-09-21/editorials/kofi-annan-speaks-out/","date":"September 21, 2004","content":"The United Nations Secretary General recently said that the U.S.-led war in Iraq was illegal.,“I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal,” Kofi Annan said last week in an interview with the BBC. This is the first time Annan has commented on the legality of the war.,The Secretary General is the only person who can officially speak on behalf of the entire United Nations; his or her comments should ideally carry significant weight. But considering the way in which member states of the United Nations behave—today and traditionally—Annan’s remarks will likely have minimal impact on the course of world events.,That is sad, but hardly surprising.,Historically, the United Nations has been flawed from the beginning. Its charter proclaims that all states are equal before the law, but gives special privilege to five countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China. The charter gives each of these states a permanent seat on the Security Council and the ability to veto any proposed resolution. As a result, these five states wield far more power between them than the rest of the world combined.,Unfortunately, there is slim chance this imbalance will ever be adjusted. No serious effort could ever be made to strip these five states of their veto power because each would simply veto any effort toward reform. The major powers act in accordance with their own national interest and not necessarily in accordance with the interests of the international community or the dictates of international law.,The Bush Administration has responded angrily to Annan’s statement and will probably ignore it. It seems disappointingly likely that the United States will maintain its presence in Iraq according to its own terms.,The United Nations is the only organization in the world that provides a forum for international dialogue and cooperation, and has the jurisdiction to make binding international law. If the United States wishes to convince the world that it stands as a beacon of democracy and the rule of law then it must at least practice what it preaches."},{"title":"Dan Rather’s apology","url":"/story/2004-09-24/editorials/dan-rathers-apology/","date":"September 24, 2004","content":"One of the most established journalists in the United States has admitted to reporting a false story.,On Sept. 8, Dan Rather ran a story on CBS’s 60 Minutes purporting to show that President George W. Bush received special privilege during his time in the Texas Air National Guard more than 30 years ago. When complaints about the accuracy of the story surfaced almost immediately after it aired, CBS and Rather stuck to their story and insisted the source was legitimate.,However, a few days ago, CBS and Rather conceded the story’s accuracy cannot be independently verified and that it should not have been broadcast in the first place. Rather has offered a public apology.,The entire debacle is a serious blow to the credibility of CBS and Rather. It should not be soon forgotten. Journalists are expected to adhere to high ethical standards when researching and reporting the news.,Sadly, those standards were simply not met in this case.,Before Rather recognized that the story was indefensible, he defended it, in part, by suggesting that it provided a counterbalance to what he said is a pro-Bush bias in the American media, especially since Sept. 11. While this is no excuse for his poor journalism, it does shed light on a more general problem with the shallowness of American mainstream media.,The error made by CBS and Rather might have been avoided altogether had the media as a whole spent less energy focusing on what the two main candidates for president did—or did not do—many decades ago.,The media should be doing more to address present-day issues instead of focusing so heavily on John Kerry’s record in Vietnam or Bush’s record in the National Guard. If this is what passes for quality news in America then it is no wonder political satirists like Jon Stewart seem to be more popular now than ever before.,CBS and Rather have made a colossal blunder. They, like all media, have an obligation to be entirely honest at all times. Rather’s apology is a good first step toward redemption, but if he truly desires the public’s forgiveness then he must recognize that a demanding onus is on him to ensure that such an avoidable error is never repeated."},{"title":"Class sizes far too large","url":"/story/2004-09-28/editorials/class-sizes-far-too-large/","date":"September 28, 2004","content":"It’s no secret that class sizes have been getting progressively larger in the last few years. Some professors have responded to the problem by assigning fewer take-home essays while assigning more in-class tests. While such a shift reduces the professor’s workload and makes teaching large classes more manageable it also reduces the quality of the educational experience.,For students and professors alike, this is a no-win situation. By reducing the number of take-home essays assigned, students are being short-changed because they are less likely to be taught important skills. Likewise, some professors are forced to structure their courses in a manner contrary to their preferences.,Essay writing skills are important because essays require students to think carefully about a given subject matter, conduct thorough research and ultimately prepare a coherent argument. In doing so, essay writing helps to develop logical reasoning skills that are essential after graduation. In-class tests that require students only to regurgitate a handful of terms or produce a few short answers are not nearly as effective in promoting these necessary skills.,One obvious source of the problem is the abysmally low funding levels post-secondary education receives from the government. If universities received more funding then more professors could be hired, more classes could be made available and class sizes would ultimately be reduced. As it is, students are increasingly being crammed into large, impersonal lecture halls where they have minimal opportunity to interact with the professor in a one-on-one environment.,Funding problems are all the more infuriating given that the University is planning to spend approximately $3 million to renovate University Ave. Sure, some new trees and a freshly paved sidewalk would look nice, but there are far better ways to spend such a large amount of money. The University should consider a re-evaluation of its spending priorities to ensure that money is spent where it is needed most.,There are no easy answers to these problems and no one should expect them to be resolved overnight. However, recognition by the University that these problems are only getting worse and are growing at an increasing rate certainly seems like a good place to start."},{"title":"Fixing University Ave.","url":"/story/2004-06-29/editorials/fixing-university-ave/","date":"June 29, 2004","content":"Queen’s wants to give University Avenue a major facelift. The University says the portion of the road running from Clergy to Stuart streets has deteriorated in the last several decades from a combination of poor funding and heavy pedestrian and vehicular use.,Physical Plant Services says the renovated street will be “a single undivided two-lane avenue lined with stately, arched-canopy trees set in spacious lawns behind seat walls defining broad sidewalks.” They say the goal is to “restore University Avenue to its historic grandeur and dignity as the premier ceremonial street on campus.”,However, the renovation seems unnecessary. It appears to be only an artificial improvement that will not benefit student life in any significant way. Particularly interesting is the University’s romantic characterization of the end product, which suggests the University might be overly concerned with its aesthetic image.,The proposed design may also present a safety concern. Eliminating the median divide may make it more difficult for students to safely cross the street and avoid traffic.,Two anonymous alumni have donated the $3 million that will be used to fund the project. The whole renovation was their idea. Naturally, those who donate such large amounts of money to the University should have some influence in deciding how the money is spent, but it is unfortunate that the alumni did not decide to spend the money on other sources, such as the Queen’s Centre or scholarships. That said, given a choice between taking the money and not, it is understandable that the University would choose the former.,Queen’s is lucky to have alumni so actively engaged and dedicated to the upkeep of the University. However, when funding is a serious problem—class sizes are ballooning and securing talented professors and administrators is always a challenge—the University and their alumni should recognize that the most important part of university is the classroom and not the scenery."},{"title":"Blood begets blood","url":"/story/2004-03-26/editorials/blood-begets-blood/","date":"March 26, 2004","content":"Thomas Carlyle stated, “Violence does even justice unjustly.”,Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of the Palestinian extremist group Hamas, was a violent leader who was not conducive to a peace-making process. However, Israel’s targeted assassination of Yassin did nothing to help end the long, bloody Mideast conflict. There are both Israeli and Arab political factions that are guilty of mass atrocities against the other, and who have produced a climate where assassination seems like the only option for progress.,Unfortunately, targeted assassinations are never a winning option if they continue to sow the seeds of hatred.,The assassination of Yassin, the leader of a group with a history of terrorist acts, did not shut down the organization of Hamas. Another leader has already taken Yassin’s place, and, if anything, Hamas has only become less predictable and more dangerous. Yassin’s assassination ensured that more violence will be borne of this violence. Reports state that Israeli citizens, of all ethnic and religious belonging, have been paralyzed into a state of fear. Israeli citizens fear, wisely, that reprisals by Hamas will soon begin. Another cycle of bloodshed is anticipated to pay for the blood spilled by Yassin.,Security of states built on violence breeds insecurity among the state’s citizens, which in turn has a devastating effect on the populace’s engagement with the political process. It is only once violence does not dominate the thoughts of all parties involved that work towards peace can begin. If the end goal of the Israeli and Palestinian people is to coexist in relative harmony, acts such as this assassination are steps in the wrong direction. The vast majority of the United Nations Human Rights Commission member states have castigated Israel’s tactics, and Israel in turn has attempted to defend themselves against critics, saying their measures were normal terrorist control. The assassination furthers an environment of hate, and has only worsened Israel in the eyes of states everywhere that are desperate to see displays of moral leadership. Hamas did not, and is not, providing that leadership.

Teachers’ unions have denounced the credit as an attack on public education, but Flaherty has defended the incentive, saying “this is not about reducing funding for public education.” We beg to differ.,The minister has ignored the fact that funds are allocated to public schools based on the level of enrollment. For every student who migrates from the public system less dollars and resources are granted to public boards, which will reduce quality.,If public schools deteriorate, concerned parents will have no where else to turn but the private sector. Concerned parents who can afford to foot the bill, that is.,More than two million students in Ontario attend public schools, while over 100,000 attend private schools. If the balance shifts because of the credit, those left on the wrong side will surely suffer.,Many parents send their children to private schools for philosophical or religious reasons, but others turn to the private sector because they lack confidence in a public education.,The Tories can’t expect to reassure doubters of the public system if they don’t even support it themselves.,This is not to suggest that the credit will cause a stampede to the admissions office at Upper Canada College or Branksome Hall. It’s not nearly enough to put a dent in their $14, 000 tuitions. It is however, enough to give us a scare.,It is true that we at Queen’s pay for a portion of our education, an education that many people could not afford even if the University accepted them based on merit. Admittedly, we also benefit from the University’s reputation, a reputation built on the backs of many elite private high schools who send their graduates to Queen’s.,Though it would be hypocritical of us to criticize the private system altogether, that doesn’t mean we can’t voice our concern over a government that seems intent on excluding, not including."},{"title":"New Principal chosen","url":"/story/2004-05-11/editorials/new-principal/","date":"May 11, 2004","content":"After a lengthy search process that took curiously longer than expected, Queen’s finally selected its new Principal.,Dr. Karen R.

Hitchcock is the first female principal in the history of Queen’s, which suggests the University is working to create a more progressive environment. That is certainly a trend that should continue.,The Queen’s appointment will be Hitchcock’s first significant experience at a Canadian University and this may mean she has a lot to learn about how universities operate in Canada. If the selection committee chose Hitchcock because she was the best person for the job, it should be applauded for its choice. Hopefully, the decision to hire Hitchcock was not affected by a lack of qualified applicants in Canada.,Hitchcock is very experienced in financial matters and has served on several Boards of Directors. While this experience is certainly an asset, Hitchcock should ensure a balanced approach as Principal that recognizes the importance of student life and does not focus too much on money matters at the expense of other aspects of the University.,The Queen’s Centre will inherently be one of the most important issues in the coming years.

When school is stressful, or when I simply want to relax and have a few drinks with friends, The Brass has always been a place where I can count on a comfortable atmosphere and a table to open up before too long. It lacks the frenzied atmosphere of Stages or the painfully image—conscious crowd of The Shot, and the beer is cheap. It's a bar, plain and simple, and I like it.,Recently, the Brass was purchased by The Hub Corporation. The Hub owns most of the bars in the busy area on Princess between Division and Barrie Streets. Before the purchase, The Brass was one of the few remaining bastions of independence in the area—just a bar, but also something of a symbol. It did consistently good business without having to resort to any sort of flashy gimmick, and back then the drinks truly were the cheapest in town.,When The Hub acquired The Brass, they assured its patrons that no drastic changes would be made. Several months have passed since the transaction, and while The Brass is still The Brass, it has hardly remained untouched. 'The cheapest jugs in town' have ballooned to $9.50—a bargain, to be sure, but a far cry from the $7.50 pitchers of yesteryear. Some renovations have been done, and a couple of things removed from the menu. For awhile, they took my favourite beer off tap, and though it eventually came back, it was sorely missed. Some might call these details trivial, and they'd be right: none of the aforementioned changes have affected the frequency of my patronage, or the general fuzzy sort of affection that I feel for the place. The change that has affected these things is harder to define or pinpoint with one or two concrete facts.,A friend of mine once remarked that it would be nice to have something to snack on while he drank. Peanuts were tossed out as a possibility, but they were soon dismissed: too much mess and, besides, the last thing you want to do is turn into Shoeless Joe's.,Lo and behold, it's not many months later, and if you walk into The Brass on any given night, you're going to step on peanut shells. That's because they're everywhere—on the floor, on the tables, in the beer. I'll admit that you can usually find a couple on my table as well. I eat the things, because they're there, and frankly, it's nice to have a snack while you drink.,It's not the peanuts themselves that are the problem; it's what they represent. The bar that was built as an alternative to club gimmickry has been given an image makeover. Stare at the posters for cheap Tuesdays now hanging all over the bar, and you'll find yourself wondering what happened to the days when every night was supposed to be cheap, and there was no need to promote one night above the rest. \t,The Brass is still The Brass, and it's still my bar of choice.

Instead, I have gotten a lesson in the painful distinction between the bureaucratic process and common sense. The lack of traffic control where I live is a dangerous problem with an obvious solution—a solution which local politicians have made far too complicated.,In order to direct traffic, city planners had nailed a stop sign to a tree on our corner. Its half-assed placement made my housemates and I wonder if it was even a genuine traffic sign.,We weren’t the only ones who wondered.,There were more car collisions on the corner that first year than I could remember seeing in the previous twenty years combined. Understandably, we were alarmed by the ambulances and police cars continually arriving at our doorstep.,Then about a year ago the stop sign moved to a metal pole in the ground, a pole like any other. This, my housemates and neighbours thought, was progress. Surely the high number of accidents on the corner would stop. Surely the number of phone calls to police we were making and the number of ice packs being brought outside would go down, if not disappear. How wrong we were.,Last summer my friend’s girlfriend had a run in with the intersection.,Driving east on Earl, she reached Frontenac and went through the intersection without decelerating—as the two-way stop dictates. Suddenly she got slammed by a car running through the ever-so-helpful Frontenac stop sign.,Her car was launched onto the lawn of KCVI; the driver’s side was totaled. Two police cars, an ambulance and a very frantic boyfriend later, the car was towed and she was taken to Kingston General Hospital.,The curb outside my house is usually littered with glass from windshields and tail-lights, and a fence on the corner has been destroyed. Twice.,This type of accident is too common, especially on a corner that is home to a high school and a skateboard park. There are many kids in the vicinity, even after school, when it is dark.,Half a block north on Frontenac is a bed-and-breakfast, and there are a number of families with small children on the street.,Considering that this is a high density, family-oriented neighbourhood with a school, a park and a place tourists can lay their heads at night, I am appalled to have witnessed seven accidents in the last 10 months at this corner. Calls, emails, and a letter have been written to our councillor, while the police tell us this corner has been a problem longer than they can remember. Why is it so difficult to get our elected representatives to read accident reports? Does a guest at the bed and breakfast need to be seriously injured before something is changed?,Instead of handing out parking tickets on Frontenac Street between 1a.m. and 7a.m. on Thursdays, maybe the city could redirect their energy.

My summer job won’t really begin for another week and the idleness of each passing day has proven conducive to indulging in guilty pleasures. The other day I picked up a copy of the April issue of Flare magazine lying around the house. I only meant to peruse it, skim it, glance at a few pretty pictures. But I was eventually lured into actually reading it.,I came to a profound realization: I must have a customized Burberry trench coat! This is a matter of necessity, not frivolity as many may think. I’m serious. With all the troubles in this world, what better way could one resolve them than with a trench? If we all had trench coats, not only would we be fashionable, but we would acquire enhanced insight into the grave issues that plague our society.,I looked beyond the fact that a very similar article had already been written months earlier by Plum Sykes in Vogue and took the article for what it was worth. Thank goodness I did this, lest I should overlook these morsels of knowledge being extolled. I mean, a customized trench coat is more than just an addition to a person’s wardrobe, it is life-changing, as the author made clear; she even went so far as to call it her NBF (for those unfamiliar with such terminology, New Best Friend—how cute).,There are so many decisions to be made that it parallels the kind of decision-making diplomats are faced with. What colour should it be? What pattern should be on the inside? There are so many variations of the signature Burberry pattern. Would she have a winter lining? To monogram or not to monogram? It’s all very daunting.,In the same magazine I read an article reassuring me that rash and unnecessarily expensive purchases are forgivable. The author was able to rationalize the purchase of a $1,000 pantsuit that after several alterations, was still never worn, and I could totally see her point. Honestly, what good could a mere grand do for starving children in the developing world?,At an institution of higher education like Queen’s, I feel greatly deprived. We never hear about customized trench coats, and there haven’t been any lectures on justifying idiotic and regrettable purchases. Economics and politics, biology and mathematics, music and drama—these won’t make us “leaders and citizens for a global society.” If we don’t know names like Manolo and Marc, the competition will have a one-up on us once we get out there.,However, there is still hope for us. On campus I have seen Juicy-clad individuals, because $200 jumpsuits are essential, almost as essential as $300 Uggs and the requisite $400 Tiffany and Co. heart chain necklace with the matching $250 bracelet. And then, of course, there are the myriad Louis Vuitton handbags, most notably, the white, colourfully monogrammed model. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, would be proud.

In the course of watching as many of the 64 games as possible, I was subjected to a set of advertisements by the NCAA regarding its student-athletes.,Most student-athletes do not enjoy all the benefits that NCAA Division I basketball players do. Alongside college football’s Bowl Championship Series, March Madness stands among the NCAA’s most lucrative sports properties. Accordingly, athletes in elite Division I programs enjoy state-of-the-art facilities, the best in equipment and apparel and the mass appreciation of an enormous fan base.,The commercials broadcast during the Final Four tournament are meant to emphasize that student-athletes exist in a range of sports and are supported by the NCAA in their endeavours. If only that were true.,One look at Division I basketball programs emphasizes the fact that its member universities and the NCAA care only about the appearance of supporting student-athletes and little else. How else to explain the re-emergence of coach Eddie Sutton, leading an Oklahoma State team to the Final Four only years after being implicated in a major recruiting scandal at Kentucky?,Sutton’s problems at Kentucky began in his first season as coach in 1985 with a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative series by the Lexington Herald-Leader. The newspaper stated that 26 former Kentucky basketball players received cash and/or gifts from boosters. A three-year investigation by the NCAA only revealed that most around the program were tight-lipped about the situation. As a result, the university was punished for not cooperating with investigators.,Nearly one month after the conclusion of the NCAA’s first investigation of Kentucky during the Sutton era, another scandal emerged. In Los Angeles, an Emery air freight envelope sent by Kentucky to recruit Chris Mills burst open, revealing $1,000 in $50 bills. In the subsequent investigation, academic rules were also found to be breached, including charges that a player’s ACT score had been changed. In all, 17 violations were found by the NCAA, who stopped just short of imposing the “death penalty” on Kentucky’s basketball program, mostly because this time the school cooperated fully. Sutton was kicked out of Lexington shortly after.,The violations that nearly buried Kentucky basketball occurred under Sutton’s watch, but somehow he’s back in this year’s tournament. While the NCAA will openly laud its student-athletes in its advertisements, it continues to do them a disservice by allowing dubious people like Sutton, Jerry Tarkanian and Jim Harrick to ply their trade and put collegiate athletic programs at risk as a result.

Tony the Tiger, Toucan Sam, the Alpha Bits Computer that sounds suspiciously male...the list goes on. There isn’t a single female character out there designed to represent breakfast cereal. Trust me, I’ve spent long, pointless hours in the supermarket building proof for this hypothesis.,So, now that I’ve brought it to your attention, don’t you find it odd there aren’t any girls? Don’t you find it bizarre that you’ve never even thought of it before? Admit it. The more you think about it, the more you mull it over during your Calculus lecture or your root canal, the more unbelievable it becomes. Even the Honey Nut Cheerios Bee is a guy.,Now, at this point you’ve likely pegged me as a militant feminist who, by way of brute force and some angry facial expressions, will set out to correct the system and have some female characters made.,But no. I really could care less which gender is used. In the whole scheme of things I wouldn’t even care if they used cartoons of postage stamps or cutlery to sell their products. I merely find the issue fascinating, first, because I can’t think of a viable reason for the lack of female representatives, and second, because I can’t believe I’m the only person who has noticed this.,When I ramble to my peers in my usual fits of random banter, I am greeted with disbelief and denial at the mention of the issue in question.,“Surely there must be one girl,” they chime in unison. But there isn’t, my simpleton friends; there isn’t.,Perhaps you’ve found this little tidbit of information pointless and random. Perhaps only random. Or, perhaps you are like myself and remain unchanged, but will wonder every so often, “What is the reason for this male-only cereal predicament?” What’s so wrong with giving Sugar Bear a female voice and some pearl earrings?”,I suppose advertising has its reasons; people are coming off the psychology degree assembly line pretty quickly, and everyone knows marketing is built on a foundation of subliminal messages. One can only imagine what the real reasons are—the strange, bizarre reasons why females aren’t used to sell cereal, the reasons why no one has been able to notice it, the reasons why the Corn Flakes Rooster doesn’t wear any pants. I could go on.,On second thought, there is something a little off about a cereal called ‘Trix’ represented by female miniskirt-clad blondes.

Of course, we did those things, but they were acts of free will performed in good fun. I may have cut my head open while jumping from my bed to my brother’s, but it was my idea as much as his.

He’s attending a prestigious business school, making marketing plans for large corporate companies and I am having trouble finding socks that match in the morning.,But I love them.

Well, I blame good parenting and an emphasis on respect and equal treatment. Sure, my brother was given a car for no apparent reason, but I swear it doesn’t bother me.,Mom and Dad, you did good.,So while I watch my brother climb the corporate ladder to success and my sister catalyze male fainting spells in the hallways of her high school, I feel enormously fortunate to have two such astounding individuals in my life."},{"title":"Along came Belinda ...","url":"/story/2004-06-29/editorials/along-came-belinda/","date":"June 29, 2004","content":"Last year, Aurora Ont. was so insignificant to Elections Canada that the redistribution of electoral ridings tomahawked the town straight down Yonge St. and equally divided its 43,000 inhabitants into two separate ridings.,Residents protested, signed petitions, and demanded the reunion of their bubble-’burb until Elections Canada agreed to mend the fissure. Aurora was thus linked with Newmarket, its neighbour to the north, and together the two towns formed their own riding and satisfied enough people.,But along came Belinda.,The former Magna princess announced her bid for the Conservative Party’s leadership at the Aurora Legion, and suddenly the town found itself on the front page of the Toronto Star the next morning.,Stronach’s eventual loss to Stephen Harper did not stop her from campaigning in the federal election, nor did it stop Harper from making a campaign stop in Aurora to make sure as many residents as possible were “demanding better.”,Not a bad show for a town that still doesn’t have a movie theatre, or a mall, or more than one municipal pool.,“Hell ya, remember Aurora,” cried Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters in a song that shares my hometown's namesake.

Now it is time for Brooks’ convocation, and Bill Leggett is mired in the stink of a public relations fiasco.,Apart from outrage over the baby’s death in Brooks’ shelter, critics are furious at Leggett for having the gall to nominate Brooks expressly for her shelter work. A look at the chronology of the degree uproar proves that Leggett must have known about Brooks’ involvement in the affair prior to her selection. And still Leggett chose to approve her selection rather than choose to honour someone else—someone who didn’t have a dead baby on her conscience.,Yes, Leggett was in a lose-lose situation and, some might say, would have gotten slammed by so-called radical feminists whether he withdrew the nomination or not, but this does not excuse his stubborn behaviour.,Yes, Leggett’s refusal to consider withdrawing Brooks’ nomination could be construed as a sign of courage on his part, but, as the degree-granting looms imminent, more and more it looks like he was just trying to save face. Leggett has exacerbated the Brooks affair by not being accountable for her nomination in the first place.,Most unfortunately, the decision to honour Brooks will tarnish not only her own symbolic degree, but also threatens to sully every other degree from this university, degrees which most students actually earn.,As it stands, May 31 may mark the first time in history a Queen’s convocation ceremony will hear boos instead of cheers.,Doctor Leggett, it’s not too late to change your mind."},{"title":"Neither was this one...","url":"/story/2001-06-26/editorials/neither-was-one/","date":"June 26, 2001","content":"Mel Lastman’s mouth has landed him in hot water.

He had gone to Mombossa expressly as the chief political representative of Toronto; to promote Toronto as the ideal host for the Games.,Unfortunately his insensitivity has cast not just himself but the whole city—whose image of multiculturalism and racial tolerance has been tarnished by the insult—in such negative light that some IOC delegates could very well reject Toronto in favour of one of the other bids. All because of this one little “joke.” Paris and Beijing have had their own scandals, but Lastman’s tactless remark comes at crucial time, just weeks before the winning bid is to be announced.

But last night, the Liberals managed to win only a slim minority government after several weeks of tight polls, and a palpable sense of shock that their hold on power hung in the air.,The campaign was particularly negative and this was certainly unfortunate. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives spent far too much time telling voters why they should distrust the other party. Canadians should have been treated to a much more civil debate. Subsequently, voter cynicism appeared to be quite high throughout the campaign.,The close result should send a strong message to the Liberals that the electorate is prepared to hold them accountable for their actions. That every major party gained seats at the expense of the Liberals suggests many Canadians are dissatisfied with the status quo.,Promoting ethics and accountability in government should be Martin’s top priority. He will need to demonstrate that the Liberals will have a zero tolerance policy toward government patronage and financial scandals.,Martin will also have to quickly adjust to governing without a majority. Given the current political climate, a minority government is the best thing for Canada because it will force Martin to compromise with the opposition. If he cannot, Canadians may find themselves returning to the polls sooner than they might like.,The strong showing of the Conservative Party is a promising development. Canada has not had a viable opposition at the federal level for over a decade and some healthy competition should help keep the Liberals in check.,Hopefully, Martin gets the message that the Liberals cannot take being in government for granted.

The U.S. has traditionally been very protective of the First Amendment right of people to publicly state their opinions, whatever those opinions may be.,However, Stern’s radio programs are offensive to many, as his material often reinforces some dangerous messages about various identity groups in society. Now, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has fined Stern for violating decency clauses concerning the sexual content in his show. Meanwhile, Stern has rightfully pointed out that certain segments on The Oprah Winfrey Show also contain similar content, and escaped penalty.,A decade has passed since Stern’s first battle with the FCC over ‘indecent’ content, and recently a fight has been brewing since a certain Super Bowl vixen bared a breast at half-time. With conservative fundamentalists and family rights watchdogs frothing at the mouth, Howard Stern is an easy target. But Stern is not only controversial, he’s also extremely popular.,The attack on Stern raises questions as to when legislating decency turns into blatant state censorship. Who is watching what our censors are censoring? The FCC, by trying to fine Stern into oblivion, has turned themselves into a de facto morality barometer of what is “in the public interest.” However, the way this mandate of protecting public interest is carried out must be re-examined.,When the FCC threatens to fine Stern, radio stations must consider whether he is a business risk worth taking, which in turn may drive him off the airwaves.,The FCC, and the public that the FCC is accountable to, need to re-examine the potential political motivations that may be driving the FCC’s selection and enforcement of their decency ruling. Some licensing should exist to monitor content, particularly material heard and watched by children, but this should be evenly and carefully enforced. As it stands, the FCC fines people inconsistently.,Individuals define decency differently, and it should not be used only as a buzzword by those clamouring for a crackdown of ‘loose’ moral values.

A third shows a pile of naked Iraqi men forced to lie on one another while American soldiers smile in the background.,The actions of these American soldiers are entirely indefensible. The Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibit such dehumanizing treatment of prisoners of war.,President Bush’s response was unsatisfactory as he has tried to evade personal responsibility. In one of his interviews on Arab television, he stopped short of offering a direct apology and his effort to speak directly to the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people might have seemed more sincere had it not been broadcast on an Arabic-language channel funded by the U.S. government.,Although the actions of these few American soldiers do not represent the American people as a whole, they highlight serious problems within the organizational structure of the military. Some of the soldiers have claimed they were merely following orders from their commanding officer, but if that is true, then the behaviours seem even more disgusting to those outside the military.,These photos show a terrible reality in U.S.-occupied Iraq. The Bush Administration must accept responsibility for the actions of its soldiers and ensure that international law is upheld in Iraq.,The photos of the Abu Ghraib prison aren’t the only photos from Iraq to make headlines recently.,An employee working for a private American firm in Iraq was fired after taking several photos of closed caskets containing the bodies of American soldiers. In a misguided effort to protect the dignity of the deceased, the Bush Administration had tried to prevent the public release of these photos.,However, showing the photos to the public was an appropriate way to pay tribute to the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives. The photos were done tastefully and firing the photographer appears to be a political move designed to conceal unpleasant images of war rather than a genuine attempt to pay tribute to the deceased.,It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, but the reaction to the pictures of tortured Iraqis and deceased American soldiers speaks volumes about the Bush Administration. After seeing the photos from the Abu Ghraib prison, the public should be very wary about the Bush Administration’s attempts to conceal the truth in the name of patriotism and the war on terror."},{"title":"The good & the bad","url":"/story/2004-04-01/editorials/good-and-bad/","date":"April 1, 2004","content":""},{"title":"Added incentive","url":"/story/2001-01-19/editorials/added-incentive/","date":"January 19, 2001","content":"AMS president Paul Heisler wrote to all qlink email addresses on Tuesday, offering free movie passes at Cineplex Odeon.

The Daily's lease had expired in May and was not renewed.,For SSMU to take the step of a full-fledged lock-out of a newspaper, and to tell interviewers that they are planning to build yet another place for McGill students to drink coffee, was a rash political move. When seen in light of some past Daily editorials that have criticized SSMU, it looks like a government silencing the media to protect itself.,And on the part of The Daily, a newspaper that has to live in close quarters with a government, to be filing injunctions with a provincial court judge to fight a loss of 220 square feet of office space is uncooperative. To be told by their SSMU landlord in July that their offices might be affected by proposed renovations, and then to face a lock-out after not responding for over a month is irresponsibly stubborn.,The McGill Tribune, The Daily’s competition published by SSMU, will be right to criticize both parties for their actions.

Millions of Canadians sent their condolences, flooded the steps of his Montreal home, and collectively tried to imagine a Canada without Trudeau — what they realized is that, regardless of Trudeau's health, such a Canada simply does not exist.,Robert Mason Lee wrote that what he liked best about Trudeau was how angry he made his father. Similarly for many young Canadians, Trudeau brought to the Prime Minister's Office the hope and charisma that seemed to embody an entire generation, and became a rose in what had previously been a dull and stuffy position. Trudeau was a Harvard graduate who had backpacked across Asia on a pocket full of bills. He drove a Mercedes convertible around Ottawa and had the admiration and support of John Lennon. He was a celebrity, an intellect, but above all, he was ours. There was another side to Trudeau, however. He allowed the United States to test nuclear weapons in northern Canada five-years after asking other small-power nations to ban nuclear tests. He mocked the Tories' wage and price control ideas, only to flip-flop and implement them a year later. His hardheaded stance against Quebec nationalists, and the partition of the Constitution without Quebec's signature, are often cited reasons for Quebec's frustration with federalism — not to mention the bang he dealt the Meech Lake Accord, when he returned to politics to stop the weak Tories from screwing-up his Canada. But that was just part of package; Trudeau had his vision of Canada and, if you didn't like it, then you could go find someone else to do the job. We tried that one — briefly. This, however, comes from someone who was born ten years into Trudeau's run as Prime Minister. What many Canadians experienced and felt first-hand, others have grown up with unconditionally; we can read, watch television and learn from our professors, but how many of us can imagine a Canada without a Charter of Rights and Freedoms? How many of us can imagine Paul Martin or Jean Chretien flipping the bird from a train window, or telling postal-workers that if they didn't like their job, he could find someone else to do it? Well, Chretien, maybe. This past week, as Trudeau's health captured the attention of a nation, the media gave us a brief chance to reflect on Trudeau's years in power. For those of you who experienced Trudeau's leadership through a period of tremendous social and political change, news of his ailing health must have felt like watching a parent or guardian fall ill. For those of us too young to know a Canada without Trudeau, it was like watching a living-legend show his mortality. For all Canadians, regardless of politics or opinions, it was a chance to reflect on the life of Canada's greatest statesman and reaffirm his immortality in Canadian politics."},{"title":"If only for the sake of legacy","url":"/story/2000-09-12/editorials/if-only-sake-legacy/","date":"September 12, 2000","content":"In 1969, Neil Armstrong left a footprint on the surface of the moon to mark his visit well into the future. A symbol, that has forever left its mark on humanity's view of space exploration. And rightly so, as the quest for perpetuity is a normal human drive, these astronauts meant to embody their achievements as something more tangible.,But a problem rears its head when this urge to leave one’s mark, is perpetuated year after year in less significant areas; as is the case with many of our campus services. With managerial tenures being a scant year in length, service directors scramble to solve all the ills of their respective services, real or imagined during the summer months. With assurances that, \"this will be the best year ever,\" these directors move on new initiatives so that one day they will be able to come back to Queen's and say, \"I did that.\" Admittedly heady stuff if the trail of your life reaches its pinnacle with a year spent managing the Used Bookstore.,This summer Alfie's went through its latest renovation (I believe this makes it three years in a row), the aim of which is decidedly unclear. The addition of a coat check was a good idea, as was the increase of bar space, but these new services are most useful when the bar is busy, making one wonder just what this was meant to achieve. Making expenditures on new additions to a money-losing service that will only be utilized by people who would have gone to the pub anyway, can not be the best use of student funds.,Mind you, it will be quite a sight, when years from now, past Alfie's managers return to the pub and puff up with pride at the sight of patrons hanging up their jackets. If that's not worth a few thousand dollars in student fees, I don't know what is.,Another current example of this trend is seen in the renovations of the JDUC's Skylight Lounge. Each incoming AMS regime has needed to determine a mandate (read gimmick) for its year in office. This year's executive will create their legacy by making major changes to an area of the JDUC that saw large-scale remodeling only three years ago.,These types of 'changes for the sake of changes' are not reserved for Queen's student government alone. We'll never know whether some Sodexho Marriott employee sees the changes to the Sidewalk Café as his piece of perpetuity. I sincerely hope someone will look back with pride at the long lines of students waiting for their morning coffee. Certainly, if history's inventors had denied their drive for legacy, there would be no cotton gin or string cheese, but there comes a time when a person must abide by the adage, \"if it ain't broke don't fix it.\",These changes may very well be the greatest thing since sliced bread, and if they are I'll be the first to swallow my pride and admit it.

Starting as a \"plea for the recognition of women's need for protection against rape and violence,\" most marches—as the one in Kingston does—prohibit men from joining, asserting that it is for women only (although men are encouraged to participate in the reception and rally). Some people have argued that this is unfair.,A significant part of addressing that question involves defining the purpose of the march. Some may feel that it is for everyone who feels unsafe walking at night, while others might argue that it is for awareness of violence and sexual assault, which transcends gender. To understand the event, however, one must look to its origins in Germany, as well as its contemporary meaning. It began as a movement for the recognition of the horrific problem of violence and sexual assault against women. It has evolved to be a means of addressing and raising awareness about women being sexually and violently assaulted in public at night. Still one could argue that there is power in numbers, especially if you are trying to raise awareness, or bring about social change. Excluding men, therefore, is detrimental and contradictory to the purpose of the event. This argument, however, suffers from a few oversights. Sure there is power in numbers, but this argument applies more to attempts to change laws or organize politically, and less to events designed to help individuals and empower women. The organizers of the event would surely welcome more women, but the inclusion of men simply for numbers’ sake defeats a higher purpose.,Arguing that men should be allowed to participate in the march comes into direct conflict with the one of the main intentions of the event—to make women feel empowered and safe at night in public. If men were allowed to march with the women, this would contradict the meaning and symbolic nature of the event; of course women would feel safe, they would be walking in a mob. How empowered would they feel? Men cannot empower women.,Some may argue that having men marching would demonstrate their support for women and encourage a change in social attitudes. There can be little doubt that having men supporting this cause is a fantastic and important step, but this event is simply not for them. Men should be encouraged to participate in other campaigns and events that oppose violence and support the march's cause, but not this one. Participate in the white ribbon campaign, attend the rally and reception, get involved in other groups or begin a march for men, but do not spout claims of gender discrimination at an international event designed by and intended for women. Granted, one can make a well-grounded argument that men suffer from many of the same threats and fears. Violent assaults against men are an equally important and pressing issue. This summer there were multiple cases of homosexual men being attacked in public at night in Kingston. But these are separate issues, and even more reason to organize or attend events meant to address those problems. The Take Back the Night march is not, however, intended to address those issues.,If the march is going to allow women to take the night back, they must be the ones marching proudly through Kingston's dark streets. Attempting to widen the scope of this event by arguing that men should be allowed to march, not only defeats the march's purpose, but removes the powerful symbolism the event relies on. While arguments that men suffer from the same threats are valid, this event is simply not designed to address them, because it centers on women taking the night back for themselves.,And to those men who wish to support this cause, we applaud you, but encourage you to find another means of expressing your support. Men cannot help with what women must do alone."},{"title":"Java Caveat","url":"/story/2000-09-08/editorials/java-caveat/","date":"September 8, 2000","content":"In July 1997, the Queen's Journal reported that a Starbuck's Coffee Co. kiosk was set to open in the foyer of Stauffer Library. It didn't.,Then president of the Alma Mater Society, Maynard Plant, said the Starbuck's proposal from food-service provider Marriott \"smacked of impropriety.\" What right did Marriott have, Plant asked, to invite a major multinational corporation to hawk its wares in our academic nerve centre?,Plant was a do-it-yourselfer, the same prez who took over Principal Leggett's office for two glorious days to protest tuition hikes, and his criticism rings true still. Why should we let an outsider brew our beans for us when we can do it ourselves and keep the money in the family?,Three years after the Starbuck's proposal dried up, there's a new kid in town. The new Common Ground coffee lounge will open next Friday in the JDUC, and an all-student staff will start serving up cappuccinos and sandwiches in the former (and grossly under-used) Skylight Lounge.,Now that the Tim Horton's downstairs has gone \"full-service\" (read \"impossibly long line-ups at 8:15 a.m.\") the Common Ground has a perfect environment in which to grow. Whereas downstairs one will have to wait in two line-ups: one to get the coffee and one to pay, at the Common Ground there is the potential for slick efficiency. The bar is right on the main thoroughfare and, if the staff is good, it should take no more than a knowing nod to get a double espresso double quick.,My only fear about the whole coffee-lounge project has to do with Dave Swantson, the consultant the AMS hired for advice in starting up the Common Ground. It remains to be seen whether the advice Swantson gave will push the Common Ground towards the Starbuck's mould of faux-Euro java chic, or whether he taught them how to make proper coffee.,A cappuccino is a coffee named for the Cappuccin religious order of Italy, whose monks wore brown robes with distinctive white hoods. So a cappuccino is a coffee with a brown (coffee) bottom and a white (frothed milk) top. This seems to have been lost in the translation to Starbuckese (Seattlish?).,All three times I have ordered a cappuccino at Starbuck's, I have been presented with a lonely shot of espresso drowned in warm milk. Short, Tall or Grande, it's all the same; never has my frothed milk lay lightly on my coffee as it should. I've even seen one \"coffee agent\" use a strainer to keep the froth out of my cup. Rather than give me a savoury caffeine jolt blanketed in airy whiteness to send me skipping on my way, these pseudo-cappuccinos hit me hard like a McDonald's milkshake and leave me feeling like a groggy cow who's long past due for a milking.,And so to Jhod Cardinal, the Common Ground's first manager, I give you my ultimatum. You're my only hope for a decent cappuccino in this milkshake town, and if it takes me more than ten twenty-cent sips to finish it, I'm going back downstairs to Timmy's."},{"title":"Righty Tighty, Lefty Loosey","url":"/story/2001-01-19/editorials/righty-tighty-lefty-loosey/","date":"January 19, 2001","content":"Every day I feel more torn. I'm being split from the left and the right.,After years of giving credence to all issues based on ideology, I'm throwing in the towel and issuing an official statement of non-alignment.,I admit it. I don't know where I stand. You may know your place on the political spectrum, but I haven't a clue, so if you happen to get lost, don't ask me for directions. I've had it.,Every single day of my young academic life, in the discipline known as political studies, I've watched numerous peers fasten themselves to ideologies of the left and right to the point where their views are completely predetermined. I'm sick to death of hearing individuals automatically defend and refute arguments because of their ideological origins rather than synthesize what is being said and actually judge them based on their merits.,If you're one of those who's always predisposed to the left/right, mixed market/free market, socialism/capitalism, one who can say with absolute certainty that your way is always the correct way, then I'd like to propose a question.,What the hell are you doing here?,Wouldn't it be easier to stay at home with your copy of The Wealth of Nations or Das Kapital—whichever floats your boat—and revel in your genius because you know what's REALLY going on. The funny thing is that these are the same people who typically label religious followers as loonies, nutcases who commit so much blind faith to a SINGLE belief.,If I come off as a sanctimonious, I apologize. I used to be a slave to ideology, and given my history, I really don't have the right to criticize. Up until recently I was an aspiring capitalist smasher, born and bred by my parents, who are both teachers, to rid the world of corporate rule and that evil sonofabitch Mike Harris.,Now, I'm trying to be a little more objective. I've watched my housemates in their latest business venture and recognize the virtues of private ownership. I wonder about giving so much of my future earnings to a government that I don't really trust. And just between you and me, sometimes I catch myself questioning teachers - nine to three every day with two months off is a pretty sweet deal, arguably too sweet.,At the same time, I am disgusted that 20 per cent of the world's population consumes 80 per cent of the world's resources, and that everyone on campus is clothed by the labour of Indonesian children.,So where do I fit in?,Truth be told, I think that a lot of us don't know exactly where we belong and that is sort of intimidating. Rather than confront this daunting question of identity we cling to a specific ideology because it's secure. Left or Right is better than nothing, at least it's belonging. And best of all, you don't have to initiate any cerebral activity, just insert the same old formulaic statements.,Mr. Right: Tax cuts stimulate consumption, which creates jobs and frees us from the tyrannical hands of big government,Mr. Left: Tax cuts mean less social programs, further impoverishing the less privileged and polarizing society you immoral bastard!,I think I'll give it some more thought,Me: ???????"},{"title":"Shooting The Star","url":"/story/2000-09-19/editorials/shooting-star/","date":"September 19, 2000","content":"Last Monday, the readership program between TorStar and Queen's kicked-off, and students are now able to get their hands on their first free copies of The Toronto Star. According to The Star, the program is not intended to expand their readership, but rather to keep people reading news in general. However, it appears that that means just more people reading The Star's news, and fewer people reading student publications.,Granted, people read The Star and The Journal for different reasons, but the presence of a free newspaper like The Star on campus undermines student media in a number of different ways. First, it hurts our publication's ability to secure advertising, when large companies know this demographic can be reached via a much larger paper. Second, dictating the location and manner in which we distribute our paper on our campus hurts our circulation — not to mention that it seems a little arrogant. Third, people only spend so much time reading newspapers, and this means that it is more likely people will spend more of their time reading The Star. While this is not a certainty, other universities like York and Laurier have noticed a decline in their readership after making similar agreements with TorStar. By inviting TorStar to Queen’s campus, the University administration has also undermined its students. Every Queen's student pays a mandatory fee to support The Journal. This fee has been kept mandatory in student referenda, which signals to us that The Journal is important to Queen's students and is worth their financial support. However, Queen's administration made a deal that undermines our ability to produce a newspaper you support.,Do you support the presence of a location-specific (neither Kingston nor Queen’s) newspaper on campus, or would you prefer one of the other two national dailies, the Post or the Globe?,On the other hand, perhaps we should be grateful that The Toronto Star has arrived on Queen's campus to save us all from the ugly grip of illiteracy — as if Queen's students didn't have enough reading to do. However, please keep in mind when you pick-up your free Star, that your intelligence isn't the only thing that has been insulted."},{"title":"Til death do us part","url":"/story/2001-01-19/editorials/til-death-do-us-part/","date":"January 19, 2001","content":"By way of a loophole in Ontario marriage law, two gay couples, Kevin Bourassa and Joseph Varnell, and Anne and Elaine Vautour, were married in Toronto's Metropolitan Community Church by Rev. Brent Hawkes. This marriage marks the first legal gay coupling anywhere since the Middle Ages.,Ontario law still respects an old religious tradition of publishing banns on three consecutive Sunday's to announce the intentions of a couple-to-be. Should no one object, a marriage may be performed. Though the law includes a number of qualifications, nothing at all is mentioned about gender. Voila, a loophole.,Despite this, Bob Runciman, Ontario's Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations, has stated that he will challenge the marriages in court, a move that the newlyweds have openly stated they are prepared for. The Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto has already announced that a collection has been taken up and earmarked for the legal expenses of upholding these two marriages.,An Angus-Reid poll from earlier this year states that the percentage of Canadians who favour legal recognition of same-sex marriages is about even with those who do not. It is this division which has allowed politicians to sit idle, trying to decide what side to support,Though the legal wranglings threaten to persist for years to come, these couples should be commended for exploiting this little loophole and taking the questions surrounding same-sex marriages out of the realm of public opinion and making them a question of rights.,The precedent set in Ontario deserves an outpouring of support. Perhaps, in spite of our provincial government's protestations, we'll finally see more same-sex marriages and the extension of a basic human right to every member of our society, gay or otherwise.,This province approves loveless, sham marriages everyday, but try to marry someone of your own gender, and our provincial government will take you to court.

However, for a significant number of Canadian athletes, their roots lay in another country besides Canada.,For the 330 athletes who will compete under the Canadian flag, 49 were not born in Canada — nearly fifteen per cent. Conversely, on the coaching staff, 32 of the 140 coaches and team leaders were born in a foreign country — just shy of a quarter.,The Globe and Mail ran an interesting article in their Saturday paper which described some of the athlete's personal experiences with Canada and its athletic program. Some of the athletes, like India-born field hockey player Robin D'Abreo, emigrated from their native countries over a decade ago and have developed their skills under the Canadian program. Other athletes, like Nigerian-born wrestler Daniel Igali, have come in search of not only a better funded athletic program, but what they perceive to be a better life. Igali simply did not return home with his team after the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, B.C., and defected to Canada.,Some of the athletes should be cautioned, however. Some of you may recall how Ben Johnson's media status went from a proud Canadian athlete to a Jamaican-born runner after he tested positive for drug use and was stripped of his gold medal.,Many of the athletes believe the diversity of the Canadian team enriches the quality of their athletic program by bringing together a wide range of experiences and techniques. For millions of Canadians watching the Olympics, however, the diversity of the Olympic team seems more representative of Canada's rich, multicultural composition.

Editor-in-chief Ben Arkin made good on his promise of last year to do away with the “high-schoolish” look of recent yearbooks, and he oversaw the production of a pleasing reminder of 1999-2000 at Queen’s. For some students, at least.,For others, he published a book that misidentified both their degrees and their disciplines, and he irresponsibly gave the OK to print a yearbook in which he knew there were many errors.,In the graduate photo spread, all students who graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree were said to have completed a Masters. Furthermore, all students who graduated with a degree in geography were identified as having a degree in geology.,The official excuse is that there was a tragic “coding error” between the photographer and the printer, but this sounds like exactly what it is, a poor excuse for an unprofessional mistake.,Arkin said he knew about the errors at least three days before the yearbook was to be printed, and well he should have. No printer would have printed such a huge run of very expensive books without the expressed consent of the editor, who would have been given proofs to examine before printing began. Having promised last year that his yearbook would be out on time (last year’s came out six months late), Arkin said that he decided to print because he “thought the problem was under control with the publisher.”,It was never the publisher’s concern how students were identified, or whether they were even identified at all. It was the editor’s concern, and if, as Arkin said, he was having difficulties with his publisher, he should not have let them translate into a sub-standard product.,When he issued his apology to the affected students, Arkin said “I wouldn’t want it to happen to me.” Of course you wouldn’t, and neither would anyone else.

Admittedly this is a burden to those students who live in and around this area, but negative feelings toward the City of Kingston should be reserved for a time when they are better deserved.,Construction was scheduled for completion weeks ago, but due to the aging nature of Kingston's infrastructure, work is not yet completed.,The biggest problems thus far have arisen not from the construction, but from the students themselves. A number of inebriated students have fallen into holes and one even went so far as to steal a bulldozer, drive it down the street, demolish a car or two, and get himself charged with with some serious traffic violations.,Roadwork of this sort is certainly a nuisance but so to are people acting like idiots.

Currently in development is a Canadian version of Survivor where two families are forced to survive in the Manitoba wilderness in mock pilgrim circumstances, or the British version where contestants are left stranded in a barren island in the North Sea.,The only problem with this trend is that reality television seems largely devoid of any reality. Survivor, the most popular example, was nothing more than tropical escapism, a voyeuristic summer at camp, and closer in vein to Who Wants to be a Millionaire than any anthropological documentary on human nature. Examining the cancellation of other, more reality-heavy shows like American High and the sinking ratings of the perpetually unexciting Big Brother — which will institute a number of unrealistic situations in future episodes to attempt to drum up more viewers — it seems that the television-watching public is realizing that watching other people's lives is as boring as watching their own.,What television executives don't seem to realize is that reality television's draw is not its reality but its lack of formula. Hypothesizing who will be the ultimate survivor is more fun than discussing the on-again/off-again Ross and Rachel debacle, because viewers aren't assured a predictable outcome.,Reality television isn't new; anyone who has watched The Learning Channel or Real World will tell you that. It is only in the past few years that the derivative nature of television has begun to weigh on the viewing public.

He is the chairman of Jubilee 2000, a church-affiliated group that initiated the quest to eliminate the debts of thirty-seven of the world's poorest countries. Bono specially requested a meeting with Martin to discuss his proposal on Monday, and has expressed gratitude for Martin's plan.,The way the moratorium would work, according to Martin, is that countries would only become eligible if they make a noticeable effort to cut poverty and increase funding for social responsibilities. Countries that \"are not currently committed to the principles of good governance,\" like Congo and Sudan, would not be eligible for the moratorium. Although it may seem like this will erase all debts, that is not the plan. Debt levels would remain fixed while the interest, which is the financially crippling aspect, would be cancelled.,The issue has been raised that Martin has not stated whether or not Canada will go through with this proposal without backing from other countries. \"The greater the pressure we can build on individual countries to move with us, the better off the poorest of the poor will be,\" he stated on Monday. Regardless of that fact, Canada is owed approximately $1-billion dolllars from impoverished countries. Surely, that would help the situation that Martin previously expressed was \"unacceptable.\",And how did other countries react to this idealistic proposal? Martin did say that interest was shown, but did not indicate from whom. The area of dissent seems to be whether or not the moratorium would help or hinder poverty. If there is no pressure from industrial countries to pay the debts, then there is no tool they can use against the non-industrial countries in order to get them to lessen poverty.,This is what I don't understand. Why should the debt be a tool of enforcement? Why can't it be a reward, which is essentially what Martin's proposal suggests. Those countries that make the effort will be rewarded with a freeze on their debts. And one reason these countries are so poor is because the majority of their revenue goes towards paying off the interest of these debts. So enforcing the payment really doesn't benefit anyone because how can they improve poverty if they simply do not have the money? I say bravo to Paul Martin for springing this on the IMF. It's time that a powerful, wealthy country stood up and said something about this issue. And I am proud to say that Canada, the international nice guy, was the one to do it."},{"title":"My Olympic Glory","url":"/story/2000-09-19/editorials/my-olympic-glory/","date":"September 19, 2000","content":"I'm not an athlete by any stretch of the imagination, but boy oh boy, do I ever love to watch sports on T.V. As long as it's not baseball or football, I have no problem with spending an entire day in front of the television cheering on Canada's finest. That's why the Olympics are like Christmas for me. With the exception of baseball, I'll watch whatever Olympic activity the networks deem worthy of my attention.,And here we are, not one week into the games of the 27th Olympiad, already being introduced to a brand new Canadian hero. Simon Whitfield has captured the nation's attention with an amazing 'underdog-comes-from-behind' gold medal performance in the Men's Triathlon. And I am proud to say that I was right there with you, Simon, jumping up and down in my living room, begging you to run faster. I clapped my hands and danced with glee as you passed Germany's Stephan Vuckovic just metres away from the finish line and ended the race victorious. My sentimental heart was beating wildly, and tears came to my own eyes as I saw you accept your gold medal and listen to our nations anthem, overcome with emotion. I felt your joy, Simon. I really did.,I have never met Simon Whitfield, as I'm sure is the case for much of Canada's population. But unlike many Canadians, I am proud to say that I was aware of his existence before Saturday evening. I cheered him on as I watched him place second in Corner Brook last July, and third at the Pan Am games in Winnipeg. Now that he's become a household name, I can’t help but be proud that I 'knew him when...' sort of. But the question is, why didn't you?,This may come as a shock to some of you, but athletes like Simon Whitfield don't only compete in the Olympics. There are many, many sports competitions held every year, and we are afforded ample opportunity to get acquainted with athletes who don't play hockey or baseball. The problem is that public interest in lesser-known events is so low that network television feels it's not worth the money to televise these competitions. If the public is not given the avenues to watch lesser-known events before the Olympics, Sport Canada will not be pressured to fund small-scale sports. So the onus is partly on the sports fan to support the home team. While the Olympic Games are a breeding ground for overnight heroes, we have to make sure that names like Simon Whitfield are not forgotten. Athletes need funding to train. I'm not asking you to fork over your hard-earned summer grant money, I'm simply asking you to stop and watch Simon Whitfield in the Iron Man Triathlon or the World Triathlon Championships. The Olympics are on for another 10 days, but Canadian athletes will be around competing in many competitions until the next summer games role around in 2004. Tune in. You just might be introduced to the next Simon Whitfield before the medals are awarded in Athens."}]
