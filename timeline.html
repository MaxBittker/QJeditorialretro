          <p class="article ">With more than half of the total vote and 13.88 per cent more than Team TPC, CMM was declared next year’s AMS executive.</p>
          <p class="quote">“As AMS executive-elect Kingsley Chak said yesterday, “the job started today, right now,” and hopefully that job will include attempts to challenge the administration, addressing issues of interest to students and developing innovative solutions.
            As well, now that CMM has won the election, Julia Mitchell needs to focus on proving that she is deserving of students’ votes—beginning by using her passion for mental health initiatives to really make a difference.”</p>
          <p class="article ">
            Some of CMM’s most important decisions will also be their first, as they will begin hiring next year’s directors, commissioners and managers in the next few weeks. The people with whom an executive surround themselves are equally, if not more, important
            than the executives themselves. We challenge them to take these decisions seriously and look beyond their campaign supporters during the hiring process. TPC presidential candidate Alvin Tedjo’s post-election comments—that his team always felt
            like they were playing catch-up—aren’t surprising. Their campaign gimmicks couldn’t make up for their lack of organization and preparation. Still, it was heartening to know the student body’s vote couldn’t simply be bought by cotton candy
            and video games. Michael Ceci won the right to represent students on the Board of Trustees next year. There were other trustee candidates with stronger platforms, and who were generally more informed. But Ceci ran a widespread and sophisticated
            marketing campaign to make sure voters knew his face and name. His plan worked. Like trustee candidate Stephanie Kenny, we hope Ceci has listened to his opponents during the campaign, and will listen to them and others when representing students
            on the influential board. But Ceci’s first statements upon hearing of his election are troublesome. He said he will work towards getting the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario to use the power granted to him by Queen’s royal charter—a power that
            was granted archaically, acts as little more than a symbol now, and has never once been employed—to appoint the four candidates who ran against him to the board. We hope that was mostly the alcohol talking. Ceci did a great job catching students’
            eyes, and we can only hope he will dedicate as much time and energy to his term representing students as he did during his campaign period.</p>
