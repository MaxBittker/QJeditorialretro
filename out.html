<div class = 'story row'><div class='three columns'> <div class='title'> Team CMM the best to take the AMS reins </div> <div class='date'>February 6, 2007  </div></div> <div class='nine columns'> <p class='article'> Team CMM’s impressive preparation, diligence and leadership potential have won us over as our preferred choice for next year’s AMS executive.<br>Although Team TPC—Presidential candidate Alvin Tedjo, Vice-President (University Affairs) candidate Liz Craig and Vice-President (Operations) candidate John Paterson—touched on a lot of the same points as CMM—Presidential candidate Kingsley Chak, Vice-President (University Affairs) candidate Julia Mitchell and Vice-President (Operations) candidate John Manning—Team CMM hit the ground
running and have never looked back.<br>Their most thought-out platform idea is to create a university-wide sustainability office, but the remainder of their platform—while showing that they’re trying to take the interest of students at heart—are somewhat recycled campaign platforms of yore. The team’s strengths lie not in promises for a video guide, another revamped website and a peer counselling service, but in their character as human beings. Although we’re concerned by Chak’s abstention from voting on a tuition increase
at the Board of Trustees, he remains one of the most informed and dedicated student politicians at Queen’s. As student trustee the past two years,Chak hasn’t yet had to work co-operatively and closely with teammates. Hopefully he’ll learn that good leaders motivate, inspire and work with those around him—they don’t merely tell you what to do. Chak’s involvement on the Board of Trustees, while providing him with a wealth of experience and insight into the functioning of the University, also presents him with a challenge: to appreciate his new position and overcome the coziness with Queen’s bureaucracy, which he has become accustomed to. Manning knows his stuff and his sharp debating last Wednesday proved that. Both during this campaign and through his previous work with the AMS, Manning has proven himself to be a strong and capable leader who takes the time and effort to learn.
What’s more, when he doesn’t have an answer for you, he’ll say so.<br>Mitchell’s lack of AMS knowledge has left us with several questions and concerns, but we remain optimistic that she will work hard to catch up. She seems genuine in her concern for student wellness and determined to make tangible improvements in this area. Chak and Mitchell also need to work
better as a team, so they don’t look like an embittered married couple: Chak needs to back off and Mitchell should step up.<br>Team CMM’s peer-counselling service may prove challenging to implement and operate. It also may not be that popular. We don’t expect students will be any more willing to discuss their personal problems with their peers than professionals, and the HCDS director said it won’t do much to reduce wait times.<br>As for TPC, their plan to install surveillance cameras at various locations on campus hasn’t been subject to sufficient research. Admittedly, the recent spate of campus thefts is a major problem, but TPC hasn’t consulted with students to find out if installing surveillance cameras is a desired response.
TPC also hasn’t taken the hint from Swipe and other failed convenience card programs with their new and improved Q.Cash platform idea. Neither have they fully explained why we need such a program,
other than to reduce wait times. And sustainability is about more than simply adding recycling bins.
Similarly, reducing the number of exams in order to declare a conflict, while an idea worthy of discussion, fails to address issues of mental health and stress in a meaningful way.<br>Tedjo has worked in a variety of different roles within the AMS, but none of his resultant experience has proven himself worthy of AMS president. Paterson has worked tirelessly for both the AMS Information Technology Office and Queen’s First Aid; while he may be one of the hardest working people in this campaign, we don’t see him as an effective vice-president. Although we are endorsing CMM, we also wish we could somehow vote for Liz Craig. Along with Manning, she stood out as
the only other strong candidate on the ballot, and she should be commended for the passion and commitment displayed throughout the campaign. She’s knowledgeable about university and AMS issues, and has already proven her leadership abilities through her extensive work within COMPSA.<br>Whether you agree or disagree, we hope that you will use our endorsement as a tool in deciding for whom to vote today and tomorrow.</p></div></div><div class = 'story row'><div class='three columns'> <div class='title'> Step in the right direction? </div> <div class='date'>February 9, 2007  </div></div> <div class='nine columns'> <p class='article'> With more than half of the total vote and 13.88 per cent more than Team TPC, CMM was declared next year’s AMS executive.<br>As AMS executive-elect Kingsley Chak said yesterday, “the job started today, right now,” and hopefully that job will include attempts to challenge the administration, addressing issues of interest to students and developing innovative solutions. As well, now that CMM has won the election, Julia Mitchell needs to focus on proving that she is deserving of students’ votes—beginning by using her passion for mental health initiatives to really make a difference.<br>Some of CMM’s most important decisions will also be their first, as they will begin hiring next year’s directors, commissioners and managers in the next few weeks. The people with whom an executive surround themselves are equally, if not more, important than the executives themselves. We challenge them to take these decisions seriously and look beyond their campaign supporters during the
hiring process. TPC presidential candidate Alvin Tedjo’s post-election comments—that his team always felt like they were playing catch-up—aren’t surprising. Their campaign gimmicks couldn’t make up for their lack of organization and preparation. Still, it was heartening to know the student body’s vote
couldn’t simply be bought by cotton candy and video games.<br>Michael Ceci won the right to represent students on the Board of Trustees next year. There were other trustee candidates with stronger platforms, and who were generally more informed. But Ceci ran a widespread and sophisticated marketing campaign to make sure voters knew his face and name. His plan worked. Like trustee candidate Stephanie Kenny, we hope Ceci has listened to his opponents during the campaign, and will listen to them and others when representing students on the influential board. But Ceci’s first statements upon hearing of his election are troublesome.<br>He said he will work towards getting the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario to use the power granted to him by Queen’s royal charter—a power that was granted archaically, acts as little more than a symbol now, and has
never once been employed—to appoint the four candidates who ran against him to the board. We hope that was mostly the alcohol talking.<br>Ceci did a great job catching students’ eyes, and we can only hope he will dedicate as much time and energy to his term representing students as he did during his campaign period.</p></div></div><div class = 'story row'><div class='three columns'> <div class='title'> Student depression rises </div> <div class='date'>January 28, 2011  </div></div> <div class='nine columns'> <p class='article'> An article published in the National Post on Jan. 24 described the unsettling results of a study focusing on student mental health.<br>A team of US and Canadian researchers surveyed students who visited campus health resources.<br>They discovered that 25 per cent showed signs of clinical depression, while 10 per cent admitted having thoughts about suicide.

I didn’t tell him he was wrong because I wasn’t sure that he was.<br>The professor ultimately let me submit the paper, but I held onto his words for years, playing them over in my mind whenever I had to shamefully ask for “special treatment” to accommodate my illness.<br>I also remembered the words of friends who told me they thought people with mental illness should just stop “whining about their problems.” I’d been made to feel ashamed, and that shame often prevented me from seeking the help I so badly needed.<br>The root of these feelings was the thing we’ve all heard so much about: stigma.<br>The way we talk about stigma reminds me of something novelist Teju Cole wrote in a March essay in The Atlantic.<br>In the essay, he notes that although we’re talking more about issues like racism, misogyny and homophobia, we’re still hesitant to actually call anyone racist, misogynistic or homophobic.<br>But oppression can’t exist without oppressors, just as stigma can’t exist without stigmatizers.<br>If we’re going to continue this dialogue on stigma, we need to stop being afraid of calling it out when we see it.<br>Accusing someone of stigmatizing may cause hurt feelings, but the risks of its continued perpetration are far greater.<br>Holly is the News Editor at the Journal.</p></div></div><div class = 'story row'><div class='three columns'> <div class='title'> Team BGP gets the green light </div> <div class='date'>January 29, 2013  </div></div> <div class='nine columns'> <p class='article'> For an explanation of how the endorsement process works, see here. <br>The Journal believes that team BGP will be the best executive in place for next year’s AMS.<br>Team BGP won the Editorial Board vote with 10 in favour and seven abstentions.<br>Team TNL received three votes and team PDA received two.<br>Over half of those who abstained stated they did so due to a personal relationship with one of the candidates, while others admitted they felt little confidence in any of the teams.<br>In the initial round of the discussion, conversations were dominated by praises of TNL.<br>But, Team BGP won the endorsement vote due to their emphasis on bringing about a much-needed change that students desire.<br>TNL had a strong team dynamic — it was clear that they all respected each other.<br>As a team of insiders, TNL also brought necessary experience but failed to convince the Editorial Board how they would dismantle the “AMS clique.”<br>Their plan to build a bridge connecting the JDUC and the Queen’s Centre also doesn’t represent what students actually want or need.<br>PDA’s campaign and platform, both based on critical and financial accountability, was commendable.

Unfortunately, PDA’s abrasive and arrogant attitudes weigh down Prescott’s strengths.<br>Vice-president of university affairs candidate Lisa Acchione was the weakest link of the entire campaign.

During the game in question, the player was allegedly sent back out onto the field after complaining of concussion-like symptoms.<br>No student should ever pay the high price that this player has. In addition to demanding extra vigilance from coaches, universities could do more to compensate athletes for their injuries.<br>While athletes do have personal discretion, coaches have the final say when it comes to whether an athlete is fit to continue playing. Student athletes, particularly football players, face incredible social pressure from teammates and the wider campus culture to perform well and be tough for the sake of winning games. As such, they have a huge conflict of interest when it comes to deciding if they’re able to play with an injury. Coaches should use the training they have and take the utmost precaution when it comes to brain injuries like the one in question here.<br>The university’s assertion that they can’t identify a significant hit which caused the young man’s injury is suspicious. The nature of concussions is that many small impacts can add up and create a larger issue. In general, brain injuries can’t always be tracked back to a specific incident.<br>It’s good to see that there is a burgeoning debate about paying student athletes in the United States. While you often hear the claim that Canadian athletes don’t make their schools any money, it’s hard to calculate the value of a program like Queen’s football in terms of Queen’s reputation as a university. Greater compensation for Canadian student athletes should certainly be considered.<br>While the current discourse about student mental health is very positive, we can’t forget about student physical health.

HCDS recommends listening to those suffering from mental illness and to refer them to a counselor.<br>However, in my experience, simply hearing someone out and telling them to seek help isn’t enough.

Large numbers of intoxicated students also swarmed the pier and jumped into Lake Ontario. <br>Woolf also posted his email on his Twitter account and blog so that they could be viewed by the public at large.  <br>While students’ conduct was highly reprehensible, several suggestions made in Woolf’s email weren’t constructive or are downright contradictory. <br>Despite admitting that the school has made significant progress since the events of 2005 — which resulted in the five-year cancellation of Homecoming — Woolf can’t help himself from threatening to cancel the event again.  <br>Last fall, Woolf hailed the ReUnion Street Festival as a success, and expressed hope that it would become a traditional event that would create a safe Homecoming for students and alumni.  <br>But despite his expressed support, the University has not provided any funding for the festival, citing both a tight budget and concern over how funding a street party would be publically perceived.  <br>Punishing harmful behaviour by refusing to fund efforts that provide a solution to this behaviour is both counter-productive and potentially detrimental to students and Kingstonians. <br>By publishing this email outside of private communication with students, the administration also raises some concerns about whether it prioritizes students’ well-being, or the University’s public image. <br>Alongside mentions of taking “pride in this university”, “an embarrassment to … the university as a whole” and “reputational damage,” Woolf referred to the deaths of 2010. This reference is deeply inappropriate in this context. <br>Presumably, Woolf is referring to the alcohol-related, accidental deaths of two students at the beginning of the 2010 school year, and not to the later incidents of suicide that raised serious concerns about the school’s mental health services. <br>The deaths of six students in 2010 — both alcohol and mental health related — should indicate that there’s a deeper problem at Queen’s than what wagging a finger will fix. <br>It’s long past the point where we’ve identified Queen’s drinking culture as a serious problem. Instead of publicly pontificating, the administration should turn its attention to resolutions. <br>Drinking at Queen’s is often more than an indulgence. For some students, the culture is so persistent that joining in is an expectation, even an obligation. <br>But, the actions of many students — from cleaning up streets and the pier to crowd-funding to repair damages — indicates that students aren’t incapable of behaving properly.  <br>If the University is unprepared to meet the challenge of their current student body, their move to increase enrolment should have us all questioning whether this space is prepared for an influx of even more students.<br>One resolution that Woolf suggests is that senior students exercise leadership. However this expectation is at odds with the University’s constant interference in normally student-led endeavours. <br>For example, the Commerce Orientation Week was placed under probation, which set strict hiring restrictions by the University that limited student’s ability to make decisions regarding what’s normally a student-run project. <br>Woolf furthermore states that, “we need the entire student body to work together.” But his email has already had a divisive effect, with many upper years taking to social media to blame first years. <br>Instead of making first years feel accepted and welcomed, they were given an abrupt initiation into the worst side of Queen’s culture that may have irreparably tainted their relationship to the university, its principal and other students. <br>Despite straight A’s for condescension, Woolf’s letter to his student body missed the boat on diplomacy. <br>— Journal Editorial Board </p></div></div><div class = 'story row'><div class='three columns'> <div class='title'> Cracking the code of a fall reading week </div> <div class='date'>December 3, 2015  </div></div> <div class='nine columns'> <p class='article'> A Fall Reading Week at Queen’s could be the light in the middle of the tunnel, but that shouldn’t be at the cost of the light at the end.   <br>Queen’s Senate Committee on Academic Procedures (SCAP) created a Fall Reading Week proposal that suggests starting the school year a week earlier, adding extra instructional days, and eliminating two days from the break between classes and the exam period to accommodate a break. In the end, SCAP and the University’s Senate will be the ones to approve the proposal. <br>Many Canadians universities are embracing the Fall Reading Week, recognizing that students are especially vulnerable to mental illness. <br>Implementing a Fall Reading Week, while a small measure, has the potential to prevent the stress that leads to mental health issues.<br>Many students already take every opportunity to travel home. Some even skip classes to lengthen their time with family. <br>Having an official break from classes would allow students who live farther away, or who don’t have the finances for travel costs, to justify travelling home — minus the added strain of making up for missed classes. <br>However, since student wellness is the reason behind a Fall Reading Week, it only stands to reason that students should be a part of the process.<br>In November, the AMS hosted two town hall meetings to garner student feedback on the SCAP proposal. However, the small portion of students who went to these meetings don’t represent the concerns of the whole.<br>To get a better sense of student needs, the University could present potential proposals to students, survey them for their opinions and conduct a student vote. Ultimately, the decision should come from the student body, and not the University Senate. <br>The importance of student input is essential, because the last thing we want is a break that creates more problems than it solves. <br>Parts of SCAP’s proposal seems to stem from a misunderstanding of how students operate — for example, taking away crucial time for studying at the most stressful time of term. Two precious days to study for exams can mean the difference between a pass and a fail. Trading in strategic days for the sake of alleviating stress would, ironically, only add stress by making it harder to budget time for exams. <br>A potential solution — instead of cutting short the exam study period — would be to scale back Orientation Week by a day or two. This would still allow for the tradition to continue, but could add a couple of desperately needed study days in the right places. <br>When weighed against improving your classmates’ mental health, it doesn’t seem too high a cost. <br>— Journal Editorial Board</p></div></div><div class = 'story row'><div class='three columns'> <div class='title'> With one counselor for 4,000 grad students, something doesn’t add up </div> <div class='date'>January 12, 2016  </div></div> <div class='nine columns'> <p class='article'> Grad students live with one foot in the harsh reality of the working world, and the other in the anxieties and financial instability of student life.<br>As students, grad students don’t receive the same benefits that an employer would owe its employees.
