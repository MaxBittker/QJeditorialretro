        <div class='title'> The Journal’s AMS & rector election wish list </div>
        <div class='date'>January 24, 2006 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> Following the barrage of attack ads and smear campaigns we were subjected to during the federal election campaigns, students can sit tight for round two with AMS and rector elections just around the corner. We have four teams and four candidates for the respective elections, which means many class talks and much soliciting of votes.
            <br>It is refreshing to see a female candidate running for rector. It adds diversity to the choices and provides a different perspective. In the history of the position, there have been but three female rectors.
            <br><span class="quote">In past AMS executive election campaigns, we have heard slogans about raising the bar, cracking the clique, and choosing a new style of student government. Unfortunately, many of these slogans have led us down a deceptive road of broken promises, leaving us feeling disappointed and thoroughly unsatisfied.</span>
            <br>Although it’s too early to say which teams will come out of the starting blocks first, we can say what we hope to see from them. While catchphrases and carefully arranged campaign posters might garner attention, they won’t necessarily guarantee votes.
            <br>Teams should try to focus on feasible objectives rather than flights of fancy that simply won’t take off, but sound exciting. Unfortunately, the impetus behind using such tactics is the reality that they often work. As a student body, we need to show them that gimmicks aren’t enough. As with the federal election, candidates need to demonstrate a genuine interest in the lives of their voters rather than trying to stick to a rehearsed platform. That said, however, candidates also need to be well-informed about campus issues and have a well-organized campaign, as these reflect the kind of government we can expect from them.
            <br>The AMS executive and rector election period can be a grueling few weeks for candidates. We only hope that they do not lose sight of the reasons they are running and clearly convey these reasons to the rest of the student populace.</p>

        <div class='title'> CFRC funding drive a worthy cause </div>
        <div class='date'>January 31, 2006 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class="quote">Last Friday, Queen’s radio station, CFRC, began its two-week long funding drive. Their goal is to raise $5,000. If successful, CFRC programming manager Eric Duncan will tattoo the CFRC logo on his body.</span> This is the first time in the station’s 84-year history that it has ever had to raise money. Three years ago, the University sold CFRC to the AMS. Since then, funding from the University gradually phased out, leaving CFRC with only what is provided by the AMS mandatory student fee, not nearly enough to cover operating costs. CFRC is operated by the AMS, so if the CFRC were to lose money, the loss would be covered by the AMS.
            <br>However, the station is looking further into the future than the end of a single fiscal year. While the AMS will cover the loss, if CFRC loses great sums of money, it will inevitably face pressure from the AMS to cut back. Rather than allowing this to happen, the CFRC is making a sincere effort to sustain itself.
            <br>CFRC is not solely a student radio station; it has an audience that widens to the greater Kingston community. It is refreshing alternative to the commercial programming by providing a variety of sounds and broadcasts that might otherwise never be heard. It is also a great place for people to gain valuable experience in radio broadcasting. While it may not appeal to the masses, it has never tried to; rather it presents its listeners with the opportunity to hear unique and eclectic programs. It has been around for 84 years and we hope it will be around for at least 84 more.</p>

        <div class='title'> Last chance for student-run discipline </div>
        <div class='date'>May 30, 2006 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class="quote">With only a week’s notice given to the AMS and the rest of the student body, the university’s seven deans collectively created a motion to be presented at Senate to remove the 108-year-old system of non-academic discipline from the jurisdiction of students, and into the hands of the “Principal of Queen’s University and/or his delegate.” Although Arts and Science Dean Robert Silverman said that the timing of the motion was not calculated, it was thoughtless and showed poor judgment.</span> A decision of this magnitude deserves a thorough examination and debate when the majority of students can be involved in the process. Even the AMS executive was only given one week’s notice.
            <br>The motion was vague, only calling to revoke non-academic discipline from students, without indicating any alternative system that would replace it, other than to consolidate all power in the principal’s office.
            <br>The events of Homecoming and of the more recent incident on Aberdeen don’t make up the majority of cases presented at the AMS Judicial Committee (JComm). Incoming chief prosecutor, Jennifer Mansell told Senate that only about 25 per cent of cases passing through JComm were Homecoming-related.
            <br>Appropriately, the motion was tabled until November.
            <br>As the Kelsea Fitzpatrick case highlights, the student-run system needs work. Fitzpatrick’s tri-pub ban was overturned by the highest appeal board and the AMS was heavily criticized in its handling of the case.
            <br>The editorial printed in the May 26 Kingston Whig-Standard, lamenting the tabling of the motion, was—like the deans’ motion—an emotional, irrational and hasty reaction to a much more complicated problem.
            <br>The main crux of the deans’ motion and the Whig’s editorial seemed aimed at solely tackling Homecoming. However, JComm operates year-round and handles a variety of cases. As Mansell mentioned in her address, before passing any such motion, Senate should first allow the recommendations made by the Senate Committee on Non-Academic Discipline and the AMS to be implemented. JComm and the peer-administered non-academic discipline system will be closely observed from now until November. The events that transpire at Homecoming 2006 will likely decide the fate of student-run non-academic discipline at Queen’s.</p>

        <div class='title'> The Greenroom-Tricolour switch </div>
        <div class='date'>June 27, 2006 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'><span class="quote"> Consider this hypothetical situation: Store A is in one location and is having difficulty consistently attracting customers, incurring losses of $60,000. Store B is in a different location and is having even more trouble: they’re $100,000 in the hole.
            <br>The solution? Switch places.
            <br>Now replace Store A with the Greenroom and Store B with the Tricolour Market, spend $20,000 of students’ money making the switch and unfortunately this hypothetical situation is a reality.</span>
            <br>According to the Board of Directors at their May 27 meeting, moving the Greenroom downstairs in the JDUC beside the post office was the ideal solution. They believe the Greenroom won’t have problems in the lower traffic area because they sell used books, and students will visit the store no matter where it is.
            <br>Well, that logic works for the first two weeks of a term, but after that, the Greenroom will have the exact same problem attracting customers.
            <br>It also seems strange that this $20,000 move is happening only a year after the Greenroom and Tricolour Market were created, and at a time when the JDUC nears demolition.
            <br>So, if all of this just isn’t adding up, then congratulations. You caught on to the ulterior motive: The Queen’s Centre.
            <br>The construction of the $230 million project will begin this year. And, in a simplified sense, having real estate space in the JDUC guarantees real estate space in the Queen’s Centre.
            <br>The AMS is willing to incur steady and considerable losses in both these services—at students’ expense—as a means to an end in the Queen’s Centre.
            <br>The AMS bought the College Book Merchant two years ago when Sandra and Doug Sutcliffe were running it and losing money. They turned it into the Tricolour Market, offering a similar product line, in order to secure retail space in the Queen’s Centre.
            <br>The Greenroom-Tricolour switch may have more to do with opening up the JDUC leases with the hope that the AMS will gain more flexibility in the products they will be able to sell—like food—in the long term.
            <br>All of this time and money could be used to help the services develop a more concrete identity and begin to provide a service that actually fills a student need.</p>

        <div class='title'> Opt-out fee awareness </div>
        <div class='date'>September 22, 2006 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> Today is the deadline for opting-out of AMS student fees and the health and dental plan. Hopefully this isn’t the first you’ve heard of it, although chances are it might be.
            <br>During the rush of the first few weeks of school, amidst buying books, dropping courses and soothing hangovers, many students forget they that have a choice when it comes to many of their AMS fees. Every year, a large portion of students overlook the opt-out process.
            <br>At some other schools, student governments charge one large fee and then distribute the money later as they see fit. What’s nice about our system, though it may seem tedious, is that each student has complete control over where their student club fees are going.
            <br><span class="quote">Queen’s prides itself on how easy it is to start a club or join one of the more than 200 existing clubs on campus. However, the number of clubs and subsequent fees are quickly growing to unmanageable levels.</span>
            <br>Because our system is based on a “you’ve opted-in unless you tell us otherwise” structure, clubs could easily take advantage of those who are unaware. There’s always a portion of students who won’t check their fees and therefore will be paying a certain sum to each club, which adds up.
            <br>To receive the funds, each individual club gets ratified every year and its fee goes to referendum for renewal every three years. One simple mechanism that could immediately increase the accountability of a club would be for the AMS to do a better job at promoting the opt-outable fees. By doing that, clubs would have an increased incentive to prove that they’re worthy of student dollars.
            <br>It’s important the AMS increases awareness about these fees, especially for the already overwhelmed and overloaded first-year students who may be paying for things they would have otherwise chosen to avoid. Students need a reminder that this is their money, and that it’s their responsibility to log onto the website and ensure they understand where it’s going.
            <br>If the opportunity to opt-out was advertised the way some other AMS initiatives are, fewer students would be wondering where their money went.</p>

        <div class='title'> Promising guidelines </div>
        <div class='date'>January 16, 2007 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> During last year’s AMS executive election, team MBT—President James Macmillan, Vice-President (Operations) Ian Black and Vice-President (University Affairs) Meghan Teuber—campaigned on a commitment to 12 promises—one for each month of the year—that, if elected, they would execute during their term. With the election of next year’s student government just around the corner, it’s the perfect time for candidates to learn how not to shoot themselves in the foot by making promises they can’t keep. Some of their initial promises worked out well, and MBT should be commended for them: Homecoming weekend was (more or less) a success, Stauffer Library was open 24 hours during exam period and All-Ages-Access was revisited and reinstated for group events. Unfortunately, other promises fell by the wayside. MBT told the Journal they were happy they set out goals as part of their campaign, because, as Black said, “It actually is a good guide.”
            <br>Although Macmillian, Black and Teuber should be recognized for putting themselves on the line and creating an informal contract with students, it’s disappointing that they are now referring to the promises as merely a “guide”.
            <br>Students voting in the upcoming elections should be wary of similar campaign promises. Although it’s admirable for a team to outline its goals, it’s also important that these goals be feasible, realistic and not already underway.
            <br><span class="quote">Year after year, AMS executive hopefuls tout ambitions plans for their year at the helm, promising that theirs will be of major changes and limitless possibilities. However, when in office, they soon discover the restraints of both time and resources. In other words, there is a ceiling to their ambition (and luckily for students, there is also a ceiling to their incompetence).</span>
            <br>Not to take away from their accomplishments, but many of MBT’s promises succeeded because of existing and external support. It’s unrealistic that they, or anyone in their position, would accomplish much alone.
            <br>Because they aren’t trying to get re-elected, it’s bizarre that MBT said they would do everything exactly the same if given another opportunity. It would have been refreshing if MBT researched their campaign “promises” better last February because a promise is a promise—not a guide. Candidates, take note.</p>

        <div class='date'>January 23, 2007 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class="quote">Before you go to bed, sip a teaspoon of olive oil and suck on a lemon wedge.
            <br>The Italian grandmother—la nonna—offered me this caveat to cure inflammatory bowel disease.
            <br>What she lacks in medical knowledge, Nonna makes up for with fierce, obsessive love for her children and grandchildren. She’s fought the fight and only wants what’s best for us.
            <br>I’ll explain how this relates to the AMS elections.</span>
            <br>Nonna puts a ridiculous amount of faith in her mother’s wisdom, particularly because she left her mother and Pordenone, a north-eastern Italian city featured in Hemmingway’s , on her wedding day with her new husband in 1951. They starved during the Second World War, and Nonno’s brother lost a toe to frostbite fighting for the Axis in Russia.
            <br>Like thousands of others during the 1950s, Nonno and Nonna immigrated to Canada after a tumultuous period in European politics—Mussolini is still a “great man,” if you ask them.
            <br>Growing up in Toronto, my father worked as soon as he could. He scrubbed chicken guts off a Keele Street butcher’s blades when he was 12, and drove a produce delivery truck before he had his driver’s licence. My mother’s parents are also Italian, but born in Canada. Their parents left Italy after the First World War, one of my great-grandfathers being forced out because he was a socialist and had to flee for his safety.
            <br>My mother’s parents were Depression kids and still won’t waste anything or spend unnecessarily. After a hot day at the driving range about seven years ago, Nonno scolded my brother and me for buying a Gatorade from a vending machine because we were only five minutes from free orange juice at home.
            <br>Nonno turns 80 this Sunday, and there will be 17 courses of food and three generations of family to celebrate.
            <br>In the last 80 years, Western history’s mass political movements have emptied on to the world. The fight for freedom of expression and civil liberties—and I’m talking about 50,000 people marching on Parliament, not 75 people walking down Princess Street—has quieted.
            <br>At Queen’s, student politics don’t matter much to people outside the and the AMS. Students are complacent, the political atmosphere neutered. It’s no surprise we’ll probably have less than 30 per cent of students vote in February’s AMS executive election.
            <br>For the 70 per cent of students who don’t vote: way to show the world that all you need to do is sit back and enjoy the view—someone else has already done your fighting.
            <br>You would think with so many people in a position of privilege—one nonno of mine didn’t bother with school and the other couldn’t afford it—students would want to do better because they are in a position to do so.
            <br>Wrong.
            <br>To combat student indifference, the Journal will dedicate a portion of its election coverage to election issues from students’ perspectives. We will go beyond reporting about campaign platforms and focus instead on issues that you would like to see discussed.
            <br>It is our hope that you will, at the very least, vote on election day—even if it’s to spoil your ballot.
            <br>And if going to candidate debates gives you indigestion, I know something you could take to cure it.</p>

        <p class='article'> <span class="quote">Campaigning for the AMS executive election begins this week and the Journal has put together a campaign wish list for this year’s candidates.</span>
            <br>1. Take the job seriously. Candidates sign up for various reasons: to pad a resume, make a difference or even to gain power. Whatever the reason, it’s important that you go in with an accurate conception of what the job entails.
            <br>2. Recognize the limitations of the position. It’s important that a team recognize its limitations (such as time and resources) as well as the limitations of each position. Going into the campaign with unrealistic goals and proposing major overhauls will do more harm than good. It’s a better idea to keep things on a steady path, or initiate change that will take place over a longer time period (meaning years, not weeks).
            <br>3. Don’t make promises you can’t keep. Teams can’t be re-elected, and therefore face no true means of accountability. Although it may be tempting to promise the world, be honest and realistic.
            <br>4. Let your character shine through. Hotbutton issues that dominated campaigns in the past, such as tuition, Homecoming and the Queen’s Centre, have more or less died down, making this campaign less about the platforms, and more about the people. It’s important to emphasize what kind of person you are and the values you find important.
            <br>Nobody is perfect, but it’s important to be honest about uncertainties or mistakes. Students want representatives with integrity and good judgment.
            <br>5. Be classy and clean. Running a clear and meaningful campaign will mean a lot more than repeating a slogan. If you do have a motto, don’t let it be your entire platform.
            <br>6. Don’t overestimate your importance. Realistically, student politics aren’t important to the majority of students, and last year’s voter turnout of 32.3 per cent is still one of the highest in the country. Voter turnout will likely be around the same rate this year so please don’t be a nuisance to those who are uninterested and push more voters away from the polls.</p>

        <p class='article'><span class="quote"> If you find yourself scrambling for enough time to attend classes, participate in extracurriculars, try doing it with a baby.</span>
            <br>The AMS after-hours child care service was cancelled in July 2005 due to a lack of demand. At that time, a study of the service showed that no more then 17-20 families used the service. With no care available after 5 p.m., undergraduate and graduate students, as well as some members of Queen’s faculty, may be having difficulty finding appropriate child care.
            <br>The Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS) is currently conducting an online survey to gain a better understanding of the number of people in the Queen’s community who would benefit from reinstating affordable, after-hours child care. Although the previous service was funded mostly by the AMS, Only 33 per cent of its users were undergraduate students.
            <br>The child care service may not be profitable, but the AMS has a long history of funding money-losing businesses—The AMS Pub Services budgeted a deficit of $64,000 this year. By this logic, maintaining an essential service such as child care, regardless of the number of students using it, should be a no-brainer.
            <br>That said, undergraduate students’ money shouldn’t be the only source of funding for a service also used by graduate students and faculty. If this service is to be re-established, the university should be responsible for the overhead costs, with the balance split proportionally between the SGPS and the AMS, depending on the ratio of the number of their members that use the service.
            <br>Child care shouldn’t be treated as a money making opportunity. The University has a responsibility to take care of student parents as it would any other minority group needing extra assistance. But if the AMS is to get back on board, external funding needs to be guaranteed: the University needs to step up and take some responsibility.
            <br>It’s important to offer these services to ensure that education is accessible to everyone. As well, providing child care may encourage those who have left school to raise children to return. Child care services are a valuable resource to members of the community and their necessity cannot be underestimated or ignored by the University and the societies who represent the students who use them. Raising a child can be a very expensive and challenging experience, especially for students, and it's essential that services are provided to make this process easier for parents wishing to further their education.</p>

        <div class='title'> Fall Reading Week won’t work </div>
        <div class='date'>February 2, 2007 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class="quote">Whether it involves heading south for some well deserved relaxation or taking the time to catch up on work (and sleep), one thing remains the same—everyone loves a break. So it would be safe to assume that adding another Reading Week to the year would be every students dream. Right?</span>
            <br>Last week, AMS Assembly approved a question to asking students if they would like to have a fall Reading Week, added to the University calendar. The question is set to appear on the referendum ballots next Tuesday and Wednesday. Although referendum questions of policy are non-binding—so even if a majority of students were in favour, the administration would not be obligated to implement it—if enough interest is generated, the results of the vote will be brought to the administration likely with the AMS’s support.
            <br>The question was put forward by Sivan Nitzan, ArtSci ’09, who was told by various members of the AMS, as well as Vice-Principal (Academic) Patrick Deane and Associate-Dean of Arts and Science Cynthia Fekken, that another Reading Week is possible, but student opinion must be considered before any changes are to take place.
            <br>What students need to understand before casting their votes, however, are the various implications attached to a second Reading Week.
            <br>One such implication is that the missed week of classes must be made up, which would likely cause school to start a week earlier in September, and thus, cutting into those last few precious days of summer holidays. Many students use the extra week in September to say goodbye to friends and family and get their things together for the new school year. As well, those who work during the summer may have a difficult time leaving their employment as many summer jobs typically run until Labour Day. Or, students may simply not want to miss a week’s worth of pay.
            <br>As a primarily residential school, Queen’s just isn’t fit to begin their fall term any earlier.
            <br>November is a rough month for students as they become stressed, sick, and even depressed. But adding another Reading Week wouldn’t address those problems, and may even create more. Issues of stress are a big deal on campus and it’s shortsighted to assume that taking a week off will alleviate the problems.
            <br>Time would be better spend addressing issues of the University system at a deeper level—a level that doesn’t treat escaping problems as the solution for better student health and wellness.</p>

        <p class='article'> On Sunday night, students received an e-mail from AMS President James Macmillan regarding the AMS Annual General Meeting and Annual Corporate General Meeting.
            <br>Not only did the e-mail not include the day the two meetings would be happening, but it also included instructions on how students could put forward a motion to be debated if they happened to be able to travel back in time to submit their motion by the deadline of the day before.
            <br>This e-mail was followed by a “Correction and Clarification” e-mail days later, which informed students of the meeting place and time of the meetings. At that point, students only had one day’s notice.
            <br>Although the date for accepting motions was extended, there’s no reason why students should have been given such late notice in the first place.
            <br>It seems as if Macmillan and the AMS Commission of Internal Affairs simply assumed average students would be too busy or apathetic to care. But that wasn’t the case when the AMS needed students to pass the Queen’s Centre motion.
            <br>Two years ago, when the AMS needed student support in order to pass the Queen’s Centre motion, they embarked on a lengthy and expensive advertising campaign, complete with full-spread advertisements in the Journal weeks in advance and gigantic posters and banners around campus, to get their message out. The result was a packed Grant Hall full of passionate students on both sides of the debate. This year, in contrast, there wasn’t even quorum. Of the required 100 students, only 65 were in attendance. <span class="quote">The AMS’s cavalier “Don’t call us, we’ll call you” attitude smacks of complacency and elitism and is an affront to the democratic processes of our student government.</span>
            <br>The AGM is one of the only times during the school year when students can come forward, vote, and have a say in what their student government does. With so few opportunities for students to really engage with the student government, it’s unfortunate that the AMS treated the meetings so flippantly.</p>

            <br>Considering the number of people with stakes in the pub and its services, it’s disconcerting to see such little semblance of a plan for its future. With Clark’s doors still shut, Queen’s traditions such as ritual, and Queen’s Players are at the very least suspended.
            <br>It’s unfortunate Clark Hall Pub was unable to stay afloat on its own. The pub’s problems and the haphazard way EngSoc is handling its closure—which itself was in large part instigated by the concerns of external bodies such as the University and the AMS—portrays students as incompetent and unable to run a service.
            <br>Sadly, Clark Hall is not an anomaly—the AMS and ASUS have had similar experiences of inefficiency and financial discordance with many of their services. Two years ago, ASUS lost $26,403, the whereabouts of which are still unknown. The AMS’s Tricolour Outfitters and UBS, formerly Greenroom, formerly UBS have been rebranded so many times no one knows what they’re called, let alone what they sell and where they are.
            <br>This attempt to fix years of student carelessness in running the pub has unfortunately fallen upon this year’s EngSoc executive and although it was perhaps time for a review and subsequent changes, the decision appears to be a rash one. EngSoc’s blunders following the closure are exemplified by its lack of a planning, transparency or any concrete information for concerned stakeholders.
            <br>An optimist might hope this fiasco would make student leaders sit up and take notice of their administrative blunders, and motivate them to clean up their act.
            <br>A realist might predict they’ll come to the conclusion that it’s easier to pass the buck until a situation like Clark Hall blows up in a student government’s face.</p>

        <p class='article'> Last spring AMS candidate team CMM campaigned across campus touting the possibility of initiating a peer counselling service. The proposal is panning out: the Peer Support Centre will open its doors in the JDUC in November, with eight to 10 volunteers providing non-academic counselling to students.
            <br>The motivation behind the centre is to give students an alternative to Health, Counselling and Disability Services (HCDS), which has waiting times of up to three weeks. The volunteers will act as a sounding board for students and can give advice on issues that aren’t considered overly serious. In cases where the issue may require professional help, the counsellor is there to redirect students to where they can find what they need.
            <br>The very fact this project is getting off the ground is impressive, and its proponent, AMS Vice-President (University Affairs) Julia Mitchell should be commended. It’s not without pitfalls, however.
            <br>Mitchell said volunteers will receive appropriate training suited to the problems they may be asked to address. But one day of instruction—the amount of time the AMS has dedicated to the training—doesn’t seem enough time to ensure the volunteers are knowledgeable on some of the difficult issues that may confront them.
            <br><span class="quote">There’s an appeal to having a peer—someone your own age, who may have comparable experiences—offer guidance. For those who can’t talk to friends about their problems, or who seek an active listener, the centre will undoubtedly provide a useful service.
            <br>However, there are downfalls to potentially having one of your classmates giving you advice on your personal matters, notably the issue of confidentiality.</span> Although the AMS is asking all volunteers to sign a confidentiality agreement, it’s debatable how anonymous a student can be when he or she may bump into their counsellor in line at Alfie’s the night after a session.
            <br>This isn’t to say the counsellors won’t take their jobs seriously, but it might be unreasonable to expect complete confidence when this type of service is operating in such a small community.
            <br>As a service aiming to provide an understanding ear for students, the Peer Support Centre will probably be successful. Its blueprint, however, remains rough around the edges and may require another draft to ensure students have access to safe and confidential counselling—not just a sympathetic ear.</p>

    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> With Homecoming less than two weeks away, the parties involved in keeping the weekend’s damage to a minimum are still scrambling to solidify plans to keep the weekend from escalating in the mayhem of Homecoming 2005. Tonight, city councillors vote on whether to close Aberdeen Street for next Saturday night.
            <br>Street closure legalizes the actual gathering of students on the street and blocks cars from access. If the street remains open, said Kingston resident and Queen’s alumnus Vinni Rebelo, many of the volunteers fear police-student confrontations will jeopardize their team’s safety.
            <br>Some councillors who are sitting on the fence on this issue contend that by closing the street, the city is condoning the party. But what should supersede that concern is the safety of those in and around the Ghetto, which will be threatened if police spend the night shoving partiers off the street.
            <br>Last year, the city, the University, police, residents and the AMS collaborated to prepare for Homecoming. So far this year, however, there seems to be disunity amongst these groups. <span class="quote">The AMS in particular has offered very little insight into what precautions they’re taking for the notoriously raucous weekend, perhaps because they’re assuming that last year’s relative calm will simply repeat itself. Given the short-term memory of the student body and the mythology that has built up since Homecoming 2005, this assumption is both foolish and dangerous.</span>
            <br>The Aberdeen Street volunteers need to work alongside the city to ensure their own safety. Volunteers last year made a vital contribution to the night’s relaxed tone by handing out plastic cups to reduce the amount of broken glass on Aberdeen Street and the surrounding area. If the street stays open and the volunteers stay clear, not only will the number of injuries from glass and debris skyrocket, but the ability of paramedics to access those in need of help will be hindered.
            <br>Those preparing for the weekend seem to have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the whole thing; it’s as though they’re collectively crossing their fingers that the near-riot of 2005 remains a fresh warning in the minds of the students.
            <br>Anyone observing the build up to Homecoming 2007 can see the problems next weekend will bring. We have to prepare for those problems now or else prepare for the weekend to crash and burn.</p>

        <p class='article'> On March 16, 2005 the AMS Board of Directors cancelled the After-Hours Childcare (AHC) service that had been in operation since 1995. The service provided weekend and weeknight childcare. It was decided that the money collected from the AHC’s $1 opt-outable fee would go to either the Ban Righ Centre or Queen’s Day Care, but neither service ever received a cheque.
            <br>The issue was forgotten until the Journal, following up on an undergraduate thesis published by Con-Ed student Andréa Stanger, approached AMS Controller Scott Bell who found the transfer had indeed never taken place. AMS Vice-President (Operations) John Manning gave the money—$7,797 plus accrued interest for a total $8,422—to Ban Righ Centre Director Barb Schlafer Friday.
            <br>AMS President Kingsley Chak pointed to previous executives as being responsible, saying it was an “oversight” on the AMS’s behalf.
            <br>It’s unfortunate the service was cancelled in the first place—although student parents are a minority on campus, they’re entitled to AMS representation. If students were still willing to pay the service’s opt-outable fee, this demonstrates a clear support for the program within the Queen’s community.
            <br>A supplementary program was proposed that would allow parents needing childcare to apply for aid but this never materialized, leaving few options for student parents.
            <br>Excusing the mistake as an “oversight” is convenient for a student government that changes every year. Accountability’s hard to come by when those responsible for last year’s management have graduated, making it easier for the current executive to shift the blame elsewhere.
            <br>But <span class="quote"> by taking on the role of leading the student body, the AMS executive needs to accept responsibility for its predecessors—even if it means cleaning up a mess that isn’t theirs.</span>
            <br>That no one in the AMS was aware the transfer had yet to occur is even more alarming. It emphasizes the benefits of having permanent staff members to ensure accountability, although it’s worth noting even the AMS’s permanent staff didn’t notice the discrepancy for two and a half years.
            <br>If our student government is struggling to keep track of one account—whether it contains $100, $7,797 or $8 million—they’re seriously jeopardizing the confidence of the student body it exists to represent. Not only will money be lost with such haphazard accounting practices, but it’s difficult to ask for the voluntary financial support of a student body that can’t be sure its money is reaching the advertised destination.
            <br>The only way for the AMS to be a truly representative body is if its promises are fulfilled and students are assured their needs are being met. Dismissing such a blunder as an “oversight” is irresponsible and hardly works to restore confidence in an already-skeptical student body.</p>

        <p class='article'><span class="quote"> Thursday morning’s AMS election results brought new meaning to the democratic mantra “every vote counts.” Team Radcliffe-Wang-St.Clair became next year’s AMS executive when the ballot recount ended shortly before 7 a.m.
            <br>Following the second round of counting preferential ballots, the margin between teams was less than one per cent and a full recount was announced around 2 a.m. When the ballots were finally counted and the results released, Team RWS was announced the victor after receiving 50.01 per cent of the unspoiled ballots.</span>
            <br>Voter turnout for the AMS election was 40.9 per cent, with 5,585 total ballots cast—larger than in previous years and impressive for a sometimes apathetic student population such as Queen’s.
            <br>The election results are telling—there was a clear division in terms of where students’ priorities lie and whom they see as the most apt leader.
            <br>On the one hand, it means almost half of voters will be led by a government not of their choosing. Although it was refreshing to see platforms that diverged in terms of their goals and stances, RWS’s 0.1 per cent victory over Archer-Collins-Howard means no consensus was reached.
            <br>On the other hand, RWS’s less-than-decisive victory will hopefully mean innovative changes next year—it would be an injustice on RWS’s part to ignore the proposals made by the other teams, which many voters clearly supported.
            <br>RWS needs to address ACH’s corporate focus and WCW’s social issues concerns if they want to be truly representative.
            <br>ACH’s accounting initiative is a makeover the AMS’s financial face desperately needs.
            <br>Team Williams-Cameron-Williams’s
            <br>ardent promotion of diversity on campus—an issue RWS also touched on—is a crucial topic that needs to be tangilbly addressed next year, whether in the form of a diversity certificate or institutionalized anti-oppression initiatives.
            <br>Closing Tricolour Outfitters is a good idea and RWS would be wise to follow through on it. If replaced by a “green space” as Wang proposed it would aid the team’s aim to create a “greener U.”
            <br>President-elect Talia Radcliffe will undeniably have a strong presence. She has a fierce personality and seems prepared to address the AMS inadequacies with which she has become familiar.
            <br>We can only hope this race’s tightness will push student voters to take responsibility for the University’s direction. Every vote counts, and St. Clair put it best when thanking her team’s supporters, astutely observing that if one person had forgotten to vote, Team RWS would have been “fucked.”
            <br>It’s difficult to say at this point whether some campaign promises were empty rhetoric, but it certainly seemed that way when the Engineering Society’s election results were announced.
            <br>For a faculty plagued by accountability and transparency woes—something President-elect Jordan Black said he hopes to improve—EngSoc’s results were far from transparent. Chief Returning Officer Mark Syer told the Journal he didn’t feel it necessary to disclose the count’s final numbers, instead just proclaiming a winner and loser.
            <br>Stonewalling reporters and the public reflects poorly on Syer and EngSoc, and offers little credibility to calls for more oversight that have come from chartered accountants, the University’s liquor-licence holder and the EngSoc president-elect, alike.
            <br>A free and fair election means publicizing results. Taking someone’s word in lieu of concrete numbers is hardly transparent and doesn’t do much to instill confidence in a faculty plagued by irresponsible administrative and financial goings-on.
            <br>Similarly, Arts and Science Undergraduate Society President-elect Jacob Mantle was far from forthcoming following the announcement of his victory early Thursday morning. Mantle refused to speak to the Journal without his running mate Dominique Vanier, who seemed to be missing in action for several hours.
            <br>It’s disconcerting to know the largest undergraduate society will soon be run by a duo whose team aspect was lacking before their victory was even announced.
            <br>Last night, Team ACH requested a recount of the ballots. Election policy permits only one recount done by hand. Thursday’s early morning recount, however, was done using computers so the request was allowed.
            <br>ACH’s decision to ask for a recount was the right one—the team should fully exercise their right to ask for the ballots to be tallied again. Not only is it part of the democratic process, but it will hopefully legitimize the election’s razor-thin margin.
            <br>Whatever the final outcome, it’s important the incoming AMS executive regard its win as a narrow victory. The victorious team has a responsibility to make changes that represent the range of needs demonstrated by the election’s close outcome.
            <br>We hope whoever takes charge of the AMS next year can make campaign promises mean more than empty rhetoric and can make government accountability more than a sick joke.</p>

        <p class='article'> AMS Vice-President (University Affairs) Julia Mitchell is conducting an audit of Orientation Round Table (ORT) spending following allegations of financial mismanagement by this year’s ORT Co-ordinator Ryan Shoemaker.
            <br>The ORT’s financial handlings came under review after Commerce Society President Dave Waugh and other society executives brought forward concerns about the bills they received for Frosh Week, many of which were thousands of dollars more than last year’s costs, and more than they had budgeted for.
            <br>Waugh said he received a bill for $18,885—$10,000 more than the previous year. The bills had only a one line item, offering no breakdown of where the money had been spent.
            <br>Spending was over budget partly because sponsorship totals fell below what Shoemaker and the ORT had projected—only $16,000 of an expected $50,000, leaving the committee short tens of thousands in funding.
            <br>Mitchell said every number she has arrived at in her audit differs from those in Shoemaker’s numbers—hardly something to inspire confidence in one’s student leaders and managers.
            <br> <span class="quote">The ORT’s financial mess is nothing short of embarrassing. A lack of accountability has become almost characteristic of the AMS and faculty societies, but when transparency is merely an oft-uttered buzz word, it reflects poorly on Queen’s ability to select competent and trustworthy leaders.</span>
            <br>Shoemaker didn’t make this mess all by himself and he shouldn’t have to clean it up alone, either. Mitchell—as well as Waugh and other society executives—are responsible for student dollars and should be constantly aware of where their money is being spent. If the ORT wasn’t getting the sponsorship money it had hoped to obtain, someone other than Shoemaker should have known about it. Society executives also had an interest in staying abreast of Frosh Week spending so they could budget accordingly—but they apparently remained willfully ignorant until handed a hefty bill.
            <br>The lack of communication between faculty societies, the AMS and its committees is nothing new. Financial bungling like this demonstrates the need for substantial reorganization.
            <br>The AMS should rethink its “no experience necessary” hiring promise—if monetary dealings figure in the job description, business experience should be a no-brainer pre-requisite. And if the experience isn’t there, it would be worthwhile for the AMS to invest in an accounting course for those employees expected to balance the books.
            <br>Mitchell’s audit is likely to reveal what seems painfully apparent: Frosh Week’s system of spending checks and balances is in a sorry state, and doesn’t feel “so good” at all.</p>

        <p class='article'> When the University unveiled plans for the Queen’s Centre in 2004, it budgeted $230 million for its construction. Phase One was supposed to csot $124 million, Phase Two $83 million and Phase Three $23 million.
            <br>The project has already cost $165 million, putting it $41 million over budget for Phase One, which isn’t scheduled for completion until fall 2009.
            <br>The University used “value engineering”—the substitution of cheaper construction materials and techniques—when planning the Queen’s Centre in an effort to keep costs down. Despite saving $20 million, the project went over budget.
            <br>Funding for the construction has come from a number of sources, including $25.5 million from the AMS and a pledged $4.5 million from the SGPS.
            <br>Vice-Principal (Operations and Finance) Andrew Simpson said he hasn’t yet considered increasing students’ financial contributions to the project.
            <br> <span class="quote">The University has some financial cleanup to do, and one can’t help wondering how we got into this mess. </span>If most of the overrun is due to rising construction costs, could the University not have tried to account for that in its initial budgeting?
            <br>The prospect of Queen’s cutting corners on the project to recoup costs is also worrisome: the outcome of this financial mismanagement could result in a Queen’s Centre missing the components that made it worth building in the first place.
            <br>Although the University’s signing a fixed-cost contract with PCL Construction Management, there’s little doubt that the cost overrun will continue to mount.
            <br>It’s also unclear how Queen’s will escape this financial dilemma: the project was budgeted to be $60 million in debt and surpassing that can’t be a good thing.
            <br>Simpson said they’re lobbying the government for more money but he isn’t optimistic about that project’s success. According to the Queen’s Centre website, $16.5 million in funding is coming from “government grants and other funding.” It’s ironic and discouraging the University’s dedicating its lobbying efforts to convincing the government the Queen’s Centre’s worthy of taxpayers’ money, while our departments continue to shrink—or disappear altogether—because the school can’t muster the funds to hire permanent professors.
            <br>Fluctuations in construction costs and overall changes in the economy are a given for such a long-term project, but the University alarmingly undershot their impact. Simpson, Associate Vice-Principal (Operations) Ann Browne and all parties involved in budgeting for the Queen’s Centre need to sit down, review what’s going where and determine how they plan to dig the University out of this hole—or start filling it.</p>

        <p class='article'> Last week, the Journal and Golden Words were anonymously delivered confidential AMS employee T4 forms after AMS Controller Scott Bell failed to move them into storage after 2007-08 financial audits were completed.
            <br>Bell said he left them in a hallway when he couldn’t gain access to the storage room and later forgot to go back and put them away.
            <br>AMS President Talia Radcliffe said the AMS will try to find out who stole the documents and file a complaint with the non-academic discipline system.
            <br> <span class="quote">It’s appalling that such an oversight could occur and even more shocking that the AMS would try to paint itself as the victim in this situation.
            <br>Although it was wrong of the person who delivered the documents to take them in the first place, he or she was arguably performing a public service. If the employees’ T4 forms hadn’t appeared on the doorsteps of campus publications, the student body might never have known about the security breach. <span class="quote">
            <br>Now that this incident is out in the open, the AMS will hopefully make changes to ensure nothing like this happens again.
            <br>The AMS’s first step should have been to issue an apology to its employees for putting them at risk for identity theft. Instead, the executive refused to take responsibility for its error and redirected the blame to the person who took the documents.
            <br>This attitude destroys students’ faith in the institution’s ability to protect their private information and highlights the need for policy changes to improve students’ security.
            <br>It’s too simplistic to fault Bell, a long-time permanent AMS staffer, for a genuine error in an otherwise clean career. Bell said he reported that he couldn’t get into the storage room and, because someone else was made aware of the situation, there should have been more accountability in ensuring the documents reached their proper destination.
            <br>Perhaps the AMS should also introduce more security measures, such as having two people to move the forms and making sure the storage space is accessible on the day they’re moved.
            <br>Changes in policy and practice would let the hundreds of AMS employees know the AMS is taking the issue seriously; in the absence of a formal apology though, that remains unclear.
            <br>If only the AMS kept employee forms as secretive as it does its accountability practices. Then they would be safe.</p>

        <div class='title'> Athletics needs team effort </div>
        <div class='date'>February 26, 2009 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> The Department of Athletics and Recreation is proposing a $120 fee increase to maintain its programs.
            <br>The fee, which will be voted on at the AMS Annual General Meeting, would be phased in. It would be increased by $50 in 2009-10, an additional $40 in 2011-12 and a further $30 in 2012-2013, then indexed to inflation.
            <br>Director of Athletics and Recreation Leslie Dal Cin said the services or facilities that received over 70 per cent support from students on the AMS winter referendum were factored into the new proposed fee.
            <br>She said the department will have to make drastic cuts if the fee increase doesn’t pass.
            <br>It’s disingenuous for the athletics department to tout the fee increase as a key measure to halt the department’s budget problems.
            <br>Although the fee is necessary, it’s a short-sighted solution that overlooks the long-term needs of Queen’s athletics programs as they inevitably face funding cuts from the University.
            <br> <span class="quote">Last year’s Athletics Review proposed cutting some varsity teams in order to give top-tier funding to fewer teams.</span>
            <br>The department must begin looking at measures such as this to prepare for the inevitable further cuts that will come as the University’s finances continue to struggle with the economic downturn.
            <br>It’s encouraging that Queen’s Athletics sought student input and provided detailed information about the allocation of the fee increase on its website.
            <br>Although it may be preferable to choose an Annual General Meeting vote to increase the fee because it’s speedier, it’s disappointing the department didn’t take such a substantial fee increase to a referendum vote.
            <br>Historically, AGMs have a lower turnout than referenda and items raised at AGMs are more likely to pass; this could suggest Queen’s Athletics is worried the fee wouldn’t pass in a referendum.
            <br>A strong athletics program can draw in alumni donations and raise Queen’s public profile, and the University should see it as a worthwhile investment.
            <br>But the department must be transparent about the state of its programs and finances in order to maintain students’ trust.
            <br>Students should pass the fee increase so Queen’s Athletics doesn’t run itself into the ground.</p>

        <div class='title'> Team CHR has the edge </div>
        <div class='date'>February 2, 2010 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> In the election for the 2010-11 AMS executive, Team Chowdhury-Hartley-Rudnicki (CHR)’s strong candidates and extensive preparation give them the edge.
            <br>The Journal’s Editorial Board voted 12-10 in favour of endorsing CHR.
            <br>Both teams demonstrate a wide-ranging knowledge of the AMS and either would make a capable student government. It’s the minor discrepancies that add up to set CHR in better stead than Team PNF.
            <br>PNF, composed of presidential candidate Mitch Piper, vice-president (operations) candidate Kasmet Niyongabo and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Davina Finn, is positioned to run the AMS reliably and uphold the status quo.
            <br>But Team CHR, composed of presidential candidate Safiah Chowdhury, vice-president (operations) candidate Ben Hartley and vice-president (university affairs) candidate Chris Rudnicki, is more prepared to hit the ground running with ambitious ideas and a focused approach.
            <br>CHR has been criticized for having lofty, unfeasible goals like bringing back Homecoming for 2011, reforming town-gown relations and working to implement solar panels at Queen’s.
            <br> <span class="quote">The AMS could benefit from an executive team with passion and ambition behind their goals.</span> CHR’s plans may not all end up being feasible, but they also won’t be harmful.
            <br>CHR has demonstrated sound and extensive research to back up many of their ambitious proposals. Their 40-page platform isn’t just bulk meant to sound impressive, and it doesn’t sacrifice quality or detail.
            <br>PNF’s platform lacks detail and its many careless spelling errors are a turn-off. Team PNF knows their platform backwards and forwards when speaking and have been impressive in running a good campaign. But the strength of PNF’s campaign doesn’t make up for its vague platform points.
            <br>PNF’s planned initiatives are perhaps more realistic than what CHR proposes. But in an AMS that has many weak spots, effective solutions will necessarily seem aggressive.
            <br>When it comes to anti-oppression and equity grants, PNF’s approach is concerning. The $5,000 grant PNF proposes for individuals with equity ideas is less focused than CHR’s proposal to give to established groups, and risks not addressing real equity issues on campus.
            <br>PNF presidential candidate Piper comes across as the strongest of the six. He’s an articulate speaker with evident leadership skills, but his team is behind the curve. Small delays in putting up PNF’s website and posting their platform add up to make Piper’s team appear less together than CHR.
            <br>Piper and CHR presidential candidate Chowdhury both have the potential to make a great president. Chowdhury demonstrated a strong leadership role last year at a challenging time for Queen’s University Muslim Students’ Association (QUMSA) and a similar drive shines through in this campaign.
            <br>Both vice-president (operations) candidates present as being very capable with a thorough knowledge of AMS services.
            <br>PNF’s candidate Niyongabo has a wealth of experience with finances outside of the AMS, positioning him well to handle operations.
            <br>CHR’s candidate Hartley’s experience serving on the Board of Directors also stands him in good stead. By occupying an internal position making decisions for the AMS, Hartley may have a slight upper hand. But this year, we can’t go wrong with either vice-president (operations) candidate.
            <br>The vice-president (university affairs) role is loosely defined. It’s important to select a candidate who will take the initiative to give the position some substance.
            <br>Rudnicki, CHR’s candidate for the role, has greater potential. As the Clubs Manager this year, Rudnicki has proven he can define a role for himself when given a position with unclear parameters.
            <br>Rudnicki has a tendency to let his passion get the better of him and speak before thinking—for instance, calling CHR’s proposed solar panel initiative “free money”—but this habit doesn’t occlude his potential.
            <br>PNF’s candidate for vice-president (university affairs), Finn has proven her leadership abilities through overseeing many powerful Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) organizations in her role as Society Affairs Commissioner. But she hasn’t made it clear what she would make of the vice-president (university affairs) role.
            <br>It’s unfortunate some supporters of PNF derailed the team’s campaign by resorting to petty politicking. Publicizing private e-mails and taking screenshots of Facebook activity is foolish and has undermined the representation of PNF’s quality ideas.
            <br>It’s also unfortunate the election has turned into a forum on solar panel initiatives when, in reality, whichever team is voted in will have little control over the project. There’s a role for student government in lobbying for initiatives like these, but solar panels are an issue that probably shouldn’t have made it into the campaign platforms at all.
            <br>Looking at the sum of all parts, CHR’s innovative approach, clear drive and well-stated goals combine to make them a better option for student government.</p>

        <p class='article'> This is madness! Madness? This is clearly Queen’s.
            <br>Working in the news team this year, I don’t think I can recall a time where there has been such an abundance of contentious student issues.  <span class="quote">From discussion surrounding Rector Nick Day’s letter and the special vote that took place, to the Alpine Tower controversy at the ASUS Annual General Meeting (AGM), to a motion for AMS to rent a bouncy castle with dancing unicorns and rainbows, I wonder; has this campus gone insane?</span>
            <br>This all was made clear to me when I attended last Tuesday’s AMS AGM and the motion to have AMS rent a bouncy castle and have pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows or have their equivalent inside the castle. I don’t know the original intentions of the person who presented the motion, and as the meeting progressed my opinion became very unsure.
            <br>Originally I had thought that the intention behind the motion was to prove to the AMS that it’s easy to pass any motion at the AGM, so long as the presenter of the motion has enough student support.
            <br>However, as the debate continued, the argument itself became unclear. What originally started as an attempt to encourage student participation in holding student government accountable soon became a push to actually rent a bouncy castle for students.
            <br>Some students stated that passing the motion and having a physical bouncy castle in front of a location such as the JDUC will generate student interest. On the other hand, others spoke about how passing the motion and purchasing such a castle would be a waste of time and resources, because if students wanted to be involved they would have come to the AGM.
            <br>Some students agreed with the intention behind the bouncy castle, but didn’t believe that the AMS should actually invest in it as a physical entity. That’s when things started getting a little crazy.
            <br>There was talk generated that the bouncy castle would be a great resource for students as it would allow them to relive stress.
            <br>Others pointed to the logistics of the situation, as they were unsure if the unicorns were supposed to be printed on the bouncy castle or would have to physically be there.
            <br>As the lines became unclear, the fact that the motion almost passed with a vote of 54 in favour and 56 against was absolute insanity!
            <br>This makes me question, whether or not increased student involvement actually means greater opportunity for betterment, or does it just slow the process down and pose time-consuming objectives along the way?</p>

        <p class='article'> On Sept. 15, AMS Assembly passed a motion to rebrand the Student Ghetto as the University District.
            <br>The motion, put forward by the Municipal Affairs Commission, was passed alongside an attendant motion that approved the establishment of the Student Maintenance and Resource Team. This team of hired students will clean up garbage, organize recycling, cut grass and even apply fresh coats of paint to houses in the Student Ghetto.
            <br>The AMS has launched an advertising campaign for the new name without making any noticeable changes in the housing region around campus. The MAC’s proposed changes should have come before the rebranding.
            <br> <span class="quote">Ghetto is a word steeped in a dark history, with ties to Jewish segregation in Renaissance Italy and the Second World War. It’s also used in North America to refer to impoverished urban areas.
            <br>Our nomenclature is inappropriate. The Student Ghetto isn’t comparable to historical ghettos, but the term’s common acceptance at Queen’s will prevent the renaming from taking root.</span>
            <br>The AMS hasn’t explained to the student body why University District is a preferable name and has instead tried to institute a new vernacular without communicating with students.
            <br>The first step in the renaming process shouldn’t be rebranding. Instead, the AMS should start by improving housing standards in the area. The student body will be more willing to see the Student Ghetto as the University District if change occurs beneath the surface.
            <br>This isn’t the first time the AMS has tried to rename the Student Ghetto. In 2007, the Student Ghetto area was officially renamed the student village, but this failed to enter popular vocabulary. This name change was superficial, and didn’t have any supporting policy.
            <br>The term Student Ghetto has stuck because of the nature of housing in the area. Houses are rundown, unclean and many landlords treat students unfairly.
            <br>Rebranding the region requires a multi-faceted change. Landlords need to treat students like first-time homeowners and less like destructive transients.
            <br>Students also need to rise to the occasion. Any attempts to rebrand the Student Ghetto will hinge on student support. Otherwise, the area will remain unchanged.
            <br>Changing the Student Ghetto’s name is the recycling of an old idea that didn’t work. For the results to be different this time, the name change needs to be backed up with substantial action.
            <br>Until we see change, the new name simply won’t stick.</p>

        <div class='date'>November 4, 2011 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> Due to online glitches in the Oct. 25 and 26 AMS elections, some students were left wondering if their votes counted.
            <br>Even after casting their ballots,
            <br>some students received emails reminding them to vote; other emails told students they weren’t eligible to vote, when in fact they were.
            <br>Most concerning, some alumni and transfer students were able to vote in the AMS fall referendum and elections for rector and Arts and Science Undergraduate Society representatives.
            <br>This error resulted from inconsistencies in the Registrar’s Office student list which the Commission of Internal Affairs (CIA) used as a voters list.
            <br> <span class="quote">It’s the AMS’s responsibility to ensure that student representatives are elected fairly, but errors have undermined the democratic process. These mistakes are unacceptable.</span>
            <br>According to the Registrar, there were a maximum of 25 discrepancies on the list, so the effect on election results was likely minimal.
            <br>AMS commissioner of internal affairs Mark Preston reported that no more than 100 students contacted him with voting issues.
            <br>Given the feedback initiative system — whereby students with problems have to contact the CIA directly — it’s uncertain if this is an accurate number.
            <br>These system errors do a disservice to the voters and lessen their faith in the process. Students are often touted as an apathetic group and this misstep, where some votes perhaps didn’t count and others shouldn’t have, reduces trust in the system.
            <br>The eligibility discrepancies resulted from lack of oversight. The CIA sent the Registrar’s list directly to VoteNet Solutions, the company that operates the voting software.
            <br>The Registrar’s Office told the Journal via email that the CIA was informed “This year’s set of data may not be as accurate as it has been in the past, since the review and tidying up of student record anomalies had not yet taken place.
            <br>This means the CIA failed to adequately review a voters list even after its accuracy was called into question.
            <br>Preston said that because of the size of the voters list, it’s hard to weed out discrepancies and “A lot of it is taking what the Registrar has compiled and accepting it.”
            <br>This reasoning is unacceptable. Steps need to be taken to ensure that discrepancies like this don’t happen. Whether or not it’s an arduous task, an accurate voters list is essential for fair elections.
            <br>If the AMS doesn’t have a member list on hand, which would presumably function as a voters list, then that’s an issue in itself.
            <br>Greater safeguards need to be put in place to keep errors like this from happening again.</p>

             <span class="quote">
The Journal lists the top five changes we want to see in 2012
            </span>The Nov. 9 announcement that admissions to Queen’s Fine Arts program would be suspended was met with shock and criticism. The movement towards its reinstatement to remain vocal and active this semester.
            <br>AMS’s committee investigating the issue put forth a motion to establish guidelines for the future suspension of programs. While useful for future program suspensions, it does little to challenge the current suspension of Fine Arts.
            <br>When the motion was brought to Senate, it was postponed for future consideration. The guidelines for future suspensions and a reconsideration of Fine Arts’ suspension needs to be weighed.
            <br>Budget limitations require sacrifices, but a more creative solution needs to be reached. Decisions need to be more transparent, and allow for student consultation — unlike the stark email that was sent to Fine Arts students without warning.
            <br>Rather than trying to justify the suspension, the University should work to find an amicable solution. Students need to rally support to secure the future of the Fine Arts program.
            <br>It’s time for Queen’s to add a fall reading week to the calendar. Doing so would bring us into line with schools like Ryerson and University of Toronto, which recently added the weeklong break.
            <br>The extra time to catch up on work and readings while providing a change of pace could immensely benefit students. Stress levels are high as assignments and readings pile up, and a break to catch up on them would be a big help to students.
            <br>Instating a fall reading week would also give graduating students time to prepare applications for graduate programs and jobs.
            <br>The idea of introducing a fall reading week was last brought to an AMS plebiscite in 2007, with an entirely different student cohort than today. Students should be given the chance to vote again on implementing the break.
            <br>With a winter semester reading week, it makes sense that Queen’s should have one in the fall as well. The change would likely impact the placement of Frosh Week or the winter break, but these are scheduling hurdles that can be overcome.
            <br>Implementing a second reading week could have a big payoff for students. If it doesn’t work out, there’s nothing to stop Queen’s from reverting back to the current system.
            <br>In response to the tragic student deaths last year, various action groups with similar goals were struck.
            <br>Groups including the AMS’s mental health committee, the Principal’s Mental Health Commission and the mental health working group should consider pooling their resources and merging into a larger and more effective body.
            <br>With greater resources at their disposal, the groups could provide an efficient and united front capable of significant action.
            <br>Working towards the same goal while functioning as different bodies could result in redundencies. A single combined group could reduce time-wasting. With months to discuss and formulate plans, action needs to be taken. It would be useful to increase the number of counselors and staff at Health, Counseling and Disability Services and provide more staff for the Peer Support Centre.
            <br>The utility of switching from percentage grades to a Grade Point Average system is questionable, but now that the change has been made, it needs to be better explained.
            <br>The 4.3 GPA system that has brought Queen’s in line with other North American universities remains complicated in the minds of students. Little explanation was provided for the change and students are stressed out, wondering what adverse effects it will have on their transcripts.
            <br>There are inconsistencies among class instructors, some of whom haven’t switched over to letter grades or have made a partial switch, using both number and letter grades. It’s confusing.
            <br>There need to be more resources put in place that will help students and faculty members to get a better grasp of the GPA system this year.
            <br>Technology is playing a greater role on campus and in classrooms at Queen’s, but current technological systems have left many disappointed.
            <br>Expectations were high for the new multi-million dollar SOLUS database, but the new program has failed to meet student hopes.
            <br>It’s not offline for 12 hours a day like its predecessor, QCARD, but a number of flaws in the new system have kept it from being a vast improvement.
            <br>Difficulties in finding financial information and a class planner that didn’t provide class times are just two examples of the major frustrations that need to be fixed. SOLUS has proven difficult to use, and would benefit from an extensive in-site tutorial or information Youtube video for first-time users. Staff at the Registrar’s Office aren’t even fully equipped to use the new program.
            <br>Another piece of technology at Queen’s that needs improving is Webmail. With email functioning as a primary mode of communication, the 100Mb inbox of Webmail is limiting. Restrictions on singular email sizes are troubling as well.
            <br>With the current popularity of smartphones, Webmail should be tweaked to make pairing your inbox with a phone simpler. As it stands now, installing Webmail on a smartphone is like navigating a maze.
            <br>Tech glitches have also been rife in the AMS’s online voting system. This year, some alumni were able to vote, while some eligible students weren’t. If problems like these aren’t repaired, the AMS should consider reverting back to a paper ballot system.
            <br>Otherwise a shadow is cast on an already low voter turnout. It’s better to have an inefficient system, as long as it ensure a credible democratic process.</p>

    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> The decision to extend an alcohol-in-residence ban to Frosh Week 2012 is a discouraging sign from Queen’s administration.
            <br>A Jan. 31 press release from Queen’s communication announced the decision to extend the ban alongside news that Coroner Roger Skinner aproved of changes to Queen’s alcohol policy.
            <br>The coroner recommended a review of the policy in May 2011 after the accidental deaths of two first-year students.
            <br>It’s a typical announcement from an administration that seems more keen on repairing reputations than on effecting true change.
            <br>The press release also stated that a committee is currently reviewing the AMS Non-academic Discipline System — as per the coroner’s recommendations.
            <br>Any attempt to remove the AMS’s control over non-academic discipline will further patronize the students at this school.
            <br>The alcohol ban means that even students who are of age aren’t able to drink in residence during Frosh Week 2012.
            <br>First-year students aren’t children who need hand-holding, and when restrictive rules are imposed, people tend to circumvent them.
            <br><span class='quote'>The ban doesn’t stop students from drinking and instead causes them to be more discreet about their habits. When students aren’t able to drink in their rooms, they’re more likely to wander into the Student Ghetto or downtown — unfamiliar areas that are less safe.
            <br>Queen’s drinking culture has yet to see significant change.</span>
            <br>Sixty-three residence citations were given out during last Frosh Week, compared to 55 in 2010; this increase has been attributed to a greater crackdown on drinking. If the number of drinking citations has increased, it’s indeterminable whether or not the ban has actually reduced consumption.
            <br>The administration issued a survey to all first-year students to gauge their responses to the alcohol ban. But these responses weren’t made public, even though the survey was used in part to justify the continuation of the ban. It’s unclear how many students responded honestly, and how reliable the survey results are.
            <br>Instead of creating a prohibitive atmosphere, policy should seek to make residence safe and comfortable. New regulations that limit the amount of alcohol allowed in a room are misguided. Residents are limited to possessing 24 cans of beer at one time.
            <br>Possessing large quantities of alcohol isn’t dangerous but consuming it is. Changing Queen’s drinking culture isn’t dependent on restricting the amount of alcohol in residence rooms.
            <br>It’s just a rubber stamp of action without real results.</p>

        <p class='article'> When the Journal’s Editorial Board voted on whether or not co-curricular records should be introduced at Queen’s, the votes were evenly split and four people were undecided.
            <br>It speaks to how varied the perspectives on co-curricular transcripts are.
            <br>Queen’s Student Affairs decided against the introduction of the new record that is separate from an academic transcript.<span class='quote'> A co-curricular record is a University-verified document of extracurricular involvement, which has gained popularity other at Ontario universities, including York, Wilfrid Laurier and Carleton.
            <br>Student Affairs axed the possibility of implementing the records after received mixed feedback from AMS Assembly, SGPS Council and a number of faculty society representatives. But, this fails to give an accurate cross-section of the student body as a whole.</span>
            <br>A simple survey could have been administered to students, allowing greater numbers to have a say on the issue. Student leaders failed to solicit input from the students they represent.
            <br>Given that resume-padding is a common tactic, the co-curricular record could add a level of legitimacy to campus involvement. Academics need to be the primary focus of the University, but experience matters as much as grades.
            <br>Clubs and other campus involvement provide valuable learning experiences that aren’t available in the classroom. Queen’s is a school where students are heavily involved, and having a record of activities would be helpful.
            <br>Adopting the co-curricular record indicates that the University values more than just academics, and gives employers a legitimate record of involvement.
            <br>But the co-curricular record also carries with it a host of potential problems. Collecting the information of every club and deciding what activities are legitimate to place on a transcript would necessitate a large investment of time and money.
            <br>Co-curricular records could also inspire people to superficially engage with activities, doing just enough to qualify for their transcript, but not really getting involved.
            <br>Because the co-curricular record is a new concept, it remains to be seen whether or not employers and graduate study programs would place value in it.
            <br>It’s possible that introducing the program wouldn’t have any real benefits.
            <br>The record is a concept that has pros and cons on each side. The decision of whether or not to implement co-curricular transcripts is one that will affect students either way. It’s unfortunate that students were handed a verdict instead of being part of the discussion.</p>

        <p class='article'> The upcoming remuneration review should focus on limiting undue burden on AMS salaried student positions.
            <br>Earliest this term, the AMS Board of Directors proposed the review to conduct a comprehensive examination of salaries and job descriptions in the AMS.
            <br>Many of these positions require students to work past their basic job description.
            <br>In return, they earn close to minimum wage — a small sum per hour given the amount of overtime put in.
            <br>It’s also undeniable that the sum these employees earn is far lower from what other student government staff earn elsewhere.
            <br>At McMaster, for example, some student leaders earn between $33,000 to $36,000 a year — about $10,000 more than the highest paid positions at the AMS.
            <br>McMaster, admittedly, is a larger school, with more students paying the essential student fee going to the salaries of student executives. This kind of discrepancy puts AMS salaries in perspective.
            <br>The AMS-specific student fee at Queen’s, currently $70.18, is designated in part to pay the salaries of AMS.
            <br>In 2009, Queen’s passed an incremental $120 student fee hike spread over three years for the Athletics Centre. It seems ironic that we’re willing to have our student leaders receive minimal pay while other, more luxurious ventures take a leading focus.
            <br>Although the reality is that Queen’s has a smaller population, limiting the possibility of raising the fee, it’s worth revisiting our priorities.
            <br><span class='quote'>Unlike other student government representatives, AMS staff have to take courses on top of their existing duties. This cuts into their already menial salaries.
            <br>Even though their pay is low, most students are unaware. The numbers are lost in translation as they aren’t directly communicated to the student body.</span> While the budget is available on the AMS website, it doesn’t differentiate specific amounts for individual salaries. Students deserve to know the exact numbers, especially given that they’re paying them through their student fees.
            <br>It’s unlikely that anyone works for the AMS expecting to get rich — it’s a drive for earning valuable experience and a passion for serving students that leads most individuals to pursue these low-paying positions.
            <br>When conducting this review, the Personnel Committee should take the financial concerns of these students into consideration.

        <div class='date'>March 8, 2013 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'><span class='quote'> In the past week, democracy at Queen’s has been deeply compromised.</span>
            <br>With Peter Green’s resignation from his elected position as the incoming AMS Vice-President of Operations and his swift replacement with Nicola Plummer, students’ questions have continuously remained unanswered. Whether it has to do with Green’s resignation or with his replacement, Eril Berkok and TK Pritchard have failed to give voters the full story they deserve.
            <br>The entire process has proven that Berkok and Pritchard don’t in fact stand for what they promised during the election. The lack of transparency and the tone taken on by the team shows that student voices aren’t truly valued. AMS Assembly has echoed this by placing their own interests above those of students.
            <br>Starting with Green’s resignation, Berkok and Pritchard demonstrated their lack of commitment to transparency. While they did release a statement on their individual Facebook accounts and vaguely explained what happened from their perspective at AMS Assembly, their side of the story still contradicts Green’s.
            <br>The day of Green’s resignation, Berkok and Pritchard repeatedly avoided requests by the Journal for an interview. They also refused to write a letter to the editor to address the issue.
            <br>While they did send in their Facebook statement, they didn’t give the Journal the chance to ask the questions necessary to understand the situation better.
            <br>They’ve also failed to provide students with three elected representatives in the AMS executive office. Starting in May, students won’t get the team they voted for.
            <br>But democracy isn’t just about elections; it’s also about how elected representatives choose to speak on behalf of their students. Plummer’s appointment was ultimately approved by members of the AMS Assembly — they should carry part of the onus for putting the interests of the AMS over the interests of students.
            <br>It’s true that the decision to use section 2.02.03 of the AMS constitution — allowing Berkok and Pritchard to nominate Plummer to replace Green — follows the procedures in place.
            <br>It’s also true that Plummer was voted in to office by elected representatives in a constitutional manner. But democracy shouldn’t just be about following rules. What elected representatives failed to do in this case was look beyond procedure and truly consider how their constituents’ voices would be best heard.
            <br>What was shown instead by voting representatives at AMS Assembly was an almost unanimous concern for AMS hiring and the damage a new election or referendum would cause to the AMS proceedings.
            <br>Students were told that a new election or any other alternative would be more detrimental to students than the outlined path.
            <br>At the end of the day, it shouldn’t be up to representatives to make that call — it should be up to their constituents.
            <br>The decision to vote with so little consideration for representing students’ voices is both patronizing and paternalistic.
            <br>In an ideal world, the fairest and quickest way to vote Plummer in would’ve been through an online referendum. A quick vote from students would have given Plummer the legitimacy to sit on AMS Assembly and serve students.
            <br>AMS Assembly didn’t have to vote yes to Plummer’s appointment, they could’ve called for an election. Furthermore, the decision to carry out the vote as a public roll call instead of as a secret ballot was unfair to voting members who may have disagreed with the status quo.
            <br>By forcing everyone to publicly voice whether they supported the motion or not, peer pressure may have played a role in the representatives’ decision more than it should have.
            <br>A closed vote would have been the fairest way to run the vote, and it’s baffling why a motion was made to make it a roll call instead.
            <br>It’s disappointing to see that many of those who spoke at the Special Assembly put their own interests ahead of those of students.Many of those who spoke in favour of this matter were personally connected to the incoming executive or had a personal stake in the matter.
            <br>While it’s true that an overwhelming majority of 37, against 3, voted in favour of Plummer taking the position, we can’t help but doubt this vote’s legitimacy due to the way the vote occurred.
            <br>As a result of the proceedings, Plummer still doesn’t have the democratic legitimacy that she would’ve had were she directly elected by the student body.
            <br>The incoming AMS executive has shown a fundamental disrespect for students’ voices. Moving forward, the very least they can do is take steps to make constitutional changes to ensure that this sort of situation doesn’t happen again.
            <br>The constitution should reinforce democracy. By engraining amendments that would allow for a quick referendum to be called in case this ever happens again, the executive can commit themselves to reinforcing democracy instead of abusing it.
            <br>Much of the damage may be irreversible at this point.
            <br>Students ultimately are not getting what they voted for. How are we supposed to trust an executive that has shown such blatant disregard for keeping their word, even before their term has begun?

        <p class='article'><span class='quote'> The vote to exclude students from census data has aggravated an already tenuous relationship between Queen’s students and the City of Kingston.</span>
            <br>There’s plenty of blame to go around. The Mayor, Kingston City Council, the AMS and Queen’s students have each done their part to make the situation worse.
            <br>Removing students from census data has resulted in a realignment which eliminates Sydenham District and greatly reduces the say that Queen’s students have in city politics. The AMS and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students are right to appeal this decision to the Ontario Municipal Board. Hopefully the appeal will be successful as the City’s decision seems discriminatory.
            <br>While the vast majority of Queen’s students don’t live in Kingston full-time, the actions taken by Kingston’s City Council encourage students to completely disregard their responsibilities to the City of Kingston. If Queen’s students are not treated as a constituency, then how can the city have high expectations regarding student behaviour?
            <br>Mayor Mark Gerretsen’s immature exchanges on Twitter have not helped matters. If the mayor wants to reach out to students on social media then he should put his best foot forward.
            <br>The mayor’s false assertion that he knew that the current AMS executive didn’t vote in the last municipal election (which he’s since apologized for) is representative of an overall dismissive attitude from the City.
            <br>Like City Council, Queen’s students need to redouble their efforts to engage in an active and reciprocal town-gown relationship. While Queen’s students are not a homogenous group, many are fairly apathetic about municipal politics.
            <br>In this situation, the AMS is partly responsible for student inaction. Student leadership should have made an issue over council’s efforts to exclude students long before they did. Students count on their representatives to foresee potential conflicts and lobby effectively on their behalf.
            <br>With so much at stake, the AMS should have been more proactive, but the overall problem rests with the City leadership’s attitude towards students.
            <br>The issue is compounded as student say in municipal politics will be greatly reduced if council gets their way. Nobody likes student apathy, and these boundary changes will surely perpetuate it.

        <div class='title'> Wary Woolf goes door to door </div>
        <div class='date'>October 4, 2013 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> Last Saturday, Queen’s Principal Daniel Woolf went door-to-door on Aberdeen and Earl Streets discouraging residents from participating in street parties or hosting keggers this weekend. Woolf passed out literature which contained information about official Homecoming events and the history of the reunion weekend. While cynical people will question the effectiveness of his strategy, going door-to-door is a better way of provoking good student behaviour than anything else that has been attempted.
            <br>It’s fun to speculate about the motivation behind Woolf’s personal appeal to Ghetto residents. It could have been an act of desperation in advance of one of his most important weekends as Queen’s Principal.
            <br>It could have been a public relations tactic to appease Homecoming’s critics, complete with an earnest Twitter picture of the act. It also could have been a genuine attempt to remind students of the historical and communal importance of Homecoming. Woolf hasn’t given us many reasons to be pessimistic about his motives, so we’re leaning towards the latter.
            <br><span class='quote'>If Principal Woolf arrived on your doorstep and talked in a reasonable tone about the importance of a smooth Homecoming weekend, you would feel a little bit guilty about your plans for a raging kegger, wouldn’t you? </span>In that sense, Woolf’s tactic might be marginally effective. A face-to-face meeting with the Principal will always mean more than a well-written but often ignored email.
            <br>Woolf’s approach is much more positive and edifying than the AMS’s “let's not fuck it up” campaign. The student government’s video which featured numerous student talking heads telling the viewer not to “fuck it up” had confusing moments. Surely our student government could have come up with a more extensive and creative campaign.
            <br>Principal Woolf has effectively put the ball in our court. His door-to-door strategy has removed the barrier between students and the administration, and by having conversations with students, he’s treating them like adults. Woolf carried newsletters outlining the history of Homecoming, the implication being that this weekend, for better or for worse, we can make history.
            <br>This editorial has been updated to reflect the following correction: The AMS video's message was "let's not fuck it up", not "don't fuck it up". Incorrect information appeared in the Oct. 4 issue of the Journal. The Journal regrets the error.</p>

        <div class='title'> AMS fumbles JDUC revitalization </div>
        <div class='date'>October 29, 2014 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'><span class='quote'> The preliminary stages of the AMS’s JDUC revitalization plan have been poorly executed, and reflect greater failures on the part of the AMS and the University.</span>
            <br>Last Monday, the AMS hosted an open house to receive feedback from students on how to spend the $1.2 million JDUC Revitalization Fund. Five potential projects were proposed at the event, three of which focused specifically on improving Wallace Hall.
            <br>Students are able to vote on which combination of projects should be undertaken through a survey hosted by SurveyMonkey.
            <br>The fund that will finance the projects was collected through the Queen’s Student Centre student fee from 2005-09, with the $1.2 million constituting the AMS’s capital contribution to Phase 1 of the Queen’s Centre. According to their agreement with the University, the AMS must spend the fund before April 2015.
            <br>This large-scale project won’t address the overall problems facing the JDUC.
            <br>The building has failed as a social space due to its uninviting environment. It’s partially a result of an accumulation of small maintenance issues that continue to go unaddressed — poor lighting; unreliable WiFi and phone signals; and faulty vents, windows and power outlets.
            <br>The availability of the $1.2 million stems from the University’s failure to deliver on Phases 2 and 3 of the Queen’s Centre. The onus to maintain the JDUC also lies with the University, which has continually overlooked the small defects that have rendered the building inhospitable.
            <br>The proposed revitalization projects focus on grandiose transformations of one room or area, but neglect the spaces students frequent most. Most students rarely go into Wallace Hall; while revamping the room may make it more enticing, it would be a poor use of funds, given the JDUC’s shabby overall state.
            <br>The current AMS executive was dealt a bad hand. With a deadline to kickstart the revitalization by April 2015, this project would have benefitted from a long-term plan, one that should have been implemented by previous AMS execs — particularly BPP in 2013-14.
            <br>It would have been far more appropriate for the AMS to solicit student opinion on how to spend the $1.2 million through a referendum question, rather than through SurveyMonkey.
            <br>The AMS’s online survey lacks legitimacy; no measures have been taken to verify if the participants are actually students, and there’s no limit on the number of responses people can submit.
            <br>The current survey restricts students to the five proposed projects, without the option of suggesting alternatives. While the AMS has said multiple options could be undertaken concurrently, the estimated cost of each project hasn’t been released, so it’s impossible to tell which projects could be combined.
            <br>Both the survey and last Monday’s open house were poorly advertised. No official email was sent out to AMS members informing them of the opportunity to voice their opinion. This severely limits student access to the survey and the details of each potential project.
            <br>Greater, legitimate strides need to be taken to gather student input before the AMS continues on with their plans, so that this revitalization adequately reflects the opinion of the student body.

        <div class='title'> Turnout needs to keep up </div>
        <div class='date'>November 21, 2014 </div>
    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class='quote'>Higher turnout in this year’s AMS fall referendum is a positive sign, but there’s still much to be done to make this year’s uptick last.</span>
            <br>Last week saw the highest voter turnout in an AMS fall referendum since 1995 — 34.1 per cent, up from 15.8 per cent a year ago. All proposed fees passed successfully.
            <br>Even though 34.1 per cent is the highest turnout in years, it’s still significantly low.
            <br>The relatively high turnout was partially a result of the implementation of a new, user-friendly online voting system. The AMS made noteworthy efforts to encourage students to vote by establishing polling stations and circulating students with iPads around campus — tactics which should
            <br>be reused in the coming winter referendum.
            <br>But what really drove the vote was the presence of popular fee proposals, such as the Bus-It and SHRC fees. Bus-It, in particular, was central to the AMS’s overall advertising effort for the referendum.
            <br>High turnout can’t sustain itself from year to year through similar circumstances. The majority of students are unaware of how critical referendums are to student life and the health of clubs and organizations on campus.
            <br>Rather than simply publicizing the referendum dates, the AMS needs to relay to the student body why they should vote in the first place. This could be done in the executive’s monthly video updates or by speaking to classes.
            <br>Allowing students to abstain from voting on certain fees this referendum was an effective move. It helps deter the possibility of clubs and publications losing their ability to operate simply because students have never heard of them, and are therefore inclined to automatically vote “no”.
            <br>The AMS made good use of the referendum by posing a plebiscite question on the Homecoming ReUnion Street Festival. This means of garnering student feedback should be used more often heading forward.

        <div class='title'> AMS acclamation omits students </div>

    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class='quote'>Without a vote of confidence, Team CBW’s imposition as incoming AMS executive was undemocratic.</span>
            <br>The AMS acclaimed CBW — Kanivanan Chinniah, Kyle Beaudry and Catherine Wright — as the 2015-16 executive last week, after they were the only team to fulfill the election’s nomination requirements on time.
            <br>It’s never explicitly stated in AMS elections policy what to do in the event that only one team runs. If a situation that isn’t covered in policy arises, the AMS Chief Electoral Officer is mandated to “interpret the policy in a manner consistent with its intentions.”
            <br>Election by acclamation has been used in the last three AMS elections where only one team has run — 1983, 1990 and, now, 2015.
            <br>But acclamation isn’t in the spirit of the policy. Instead, it prioritizes the best interest of the team involved and omits the input of students.
            <br>With an acclamation, the winning team — who will be responsible for student advocacy, services and commissions — is ushered in before students know anything about them, simply because they handed in the right paperwork on time.
            <br>The AMS needs to hold a vote of confidence, as ASUS, ComSoc, CESA and ResSoc did last year in uncontested elections. The AMS’s executive election policy should also be updated to explicitly state what to do in the event that only one team runs, rather than leaving the policy up to interpretation.
            <br>Whether students have confidence in the single team or not, they deserve the opportunity to voice their opinion.
            <br>Voting, even for confidence, establishes accountability in those who are eventually voted in. That accountability isn’t there with an acclamation; voters have no say in who’s selected to run their society.
            <br>The AMS didn’t send an email — or any message to all students — announcing the acclamation. Instead, they announced it over Facebook and Twitter, which only their followers could see, and released a press release that, instead of being featured on the front page of their website, was buried in the “Campus News” section.
            <br>In lieu of debates, CBW is hosting a pair of public forums — on Monday and Tuesday evenings — to meet with students and discuss future initiatives. These forums weren’t sufficiently advertised in advance.
            <br>While it’s problematic that there’s no specific AMS policy to deal with uncontested executive elections, the crux of the issue is that only one team ran in the first place.
            <br>AMS Chief Electoral Officer Chris Casher told the Journal last week that the election process was “properly advertised” — but two print advertisements in the Journal, a post on the AMS website and a 26-word announcement in the executive’s December newsletter isn’t nearly enough.
            <br>Mass emails, poster campaigns, class talks and messages on TV screens in the Queen’s Centre are all ways the AMS could have better advertised the nomination period — and, perhaps, attracted more than three candidates from over 16,000 undergraduate students.
            <br>Without a voting process to let students choose their future executive, CBW has to work even harder to prove they deserve their new roles.
            <br>So far, their relationship with the student body has gotten off to a rocky start.
            <br>While nominated teams usually release their platform at the very beginning of the campaign period, CBW only released theirs Monday — five days after their acclamation, without any public explanation for the delay.
            <br>CBW — whose three members all have experience working for the AMS or a faculty society — should have had their platform ready for release last Friday. Even a brief summary of their primary objectives would have sufficed.
            <br>So far, the AMS and CBW have done the absolute bare minimum to engage students. It’s a troubling approach from our current and future student leaders.

    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class='quote'>Simple adjustments can be made to the AMS referendum process to ensure students understand the influence their vote has.</span>
            <br>For a second year in a row, MUSE Magazine’s $0.50 opt-out fee proposal failed to pass in a referendum. 50.9 per cent of voters voted against the establishment of the fee last week, while 803 voters abstained.
            <br>Students have a confounding tendency to oppose the implementation of inexpensive opt-out fees. This shone through in the 4,065 total abstentions to six opt-out fees on this year’s ballot — none of which exceeded $1.25.
            <br>It was also clear in the amount of “no” votes on non-controversial proposals — including 21.5 per cent disapproval to an $0.08 Queen’s Diabetic Society fee.
            <br>The high number of abstentions and “no” votes might indicate a fundamental misunderstanding from voters of what referendums actually are.
            <br>Students could be unaware that when they vote “yes” to establishing an opt-out fee, it doesn’t mean they’ll automatically have to pay it. Instead, they’re merely giving a club the opportunity to ask for financial support from students later on, which students are able to decline as they wish.
            <br>When a student votes “no” to establishing an opt-out fee, they’re essentially saying the club has no value and shouldn’t exist.
            <br>The onus is partially on clubs to advertise themselves and explain their value to students, but MUSE’s staff did more than the average club to promote themselves, by posting on social media, running a campaign in the Queen’s Centre and publishing notices on their website and the AMS’s.
            <br>The AMS has made efforts to encourage voter turnout, but the meaning of each type of referendum question should be clarified. This could come in the form of a brief explanation that accompanies email notices and the online ballot.
            <br>Another issue with the referendum — one that’s more difficult to address — is that a lot of votes may be based on recognition of keywords.
            <br>Advocacy clubs — ones that students may have never heard of, but that contain buzzwords such as “children”, “charity” and “illness” — likely aren’t scrutinized to the same degree as other student organizations. When recognizable, emotionally-charged words aren’t in the club name, students could be more inclined to abstain or vote “no”.
            <br>One way to combat this would be to include a short description of each club alongside the referendum question — similar to those provided for faculty society senator and representative candidates.
            <br>A brief explanation of what it means to “abstain”, meanwhile, could go a long way to prevent misuse of the option.

    </div>
    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> It’s in the University’s best interests to help establish the ReUnion Street Festival as a new Homecoming tradition.
            <br>The inaugural festival — held in October — proved to be a great success, with roughly 5,000-6,000 people attending. 94.3 per cent of students who participated in the AMS fall referendum responded “yes” to a plebiscite question asking if they wished to see the festival established as an annual Homecoming event.
            <br>The 2014 festival cost $250,000 and was paid for primarily by the AMS. For future Homecomings, the AMS is lobbying the University to provide at least $75,000 to fund the festival.
            <br>Despite the AMS’s efforts and Principal Daniel Woolf’s verbal support for the festival, the University is refusing to cover any costs.
            <br>Queen’s administration set a precedent of paying for Homecoming when they agreed in 2013 to pay the City of Kingston $100,000 annually for three years for extra police costs. The University should also be investing in an event that directly benefits alumni and students.
            <br>The best way for Queen’s to deter students and other revelers from attending Homecoming street parties is to support proactive initiatives like the ReUnion festival, which will draw crowds away from Aberdeen St. and promote responsible drinking.
            <br>Alumni should have a space to mingle with current students during Homecoming weekend, and the festival fits the bill. Improving the Homecoming experience could encourage alumni to donate to the University.
            <br>The AMS covered the majority of the inaugural festival’s costs. While the University provided a significant amount of in-kind support — such as staffing and security — it should also cast its financial support behind this venture.
            <br>AMS President Allison Williams said the festival could become self-financing in five years through sponsorship, meaning Queen’s support could only be needed for the short-term.
            <br>The University hasn’t given a clear reason why they’re refusing. If it’s due to financial constraints, they could run an advancement campaign to garner funds.
            <br>The University has run successful campaigns for capital projects that alumni might never directly benefit from, including the Isabel Bader Centre and the new Richardson Stadium. It shouldn’t be difficult to raise $75,000 for something alumni can directly enjoy.
            <br><span class='quote'>The AMS has done their due diligence. While they would still be paying for the majority of the festival, they shouldn’t be the only ones to shoulder the responsibility.</span>

    <div class='nine columns'>
        <p class='article'> <span class='quote'>When they decided to nullify the fall referendum results, the AMS didn’t just decide the fate of the election — student input was tossed out the window as well.</span>
            <br>The fall referendum results were nullified by AMS assembly in a closed door session after it came to light that their Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) hadn’t paid her student fees and was therefore not a part of the AMS. (*See Editor's Note below)
            <br>This isn’t the first time the AMS has bungled the election. Technical difficulties forced an extension to the election period this year, while concerns in the past include students being completely left out and emails being misdirected.
            <br>The main role of the AMS is the collection and allocation of funds. The vast majority of interaction between students and the AMS involves paying their student fees, and then getting a say in where those fees end up.
            <br>The clubs whose funding is now threatened offer important services to students, and the proper handling of their funding is perhaps the most important service students require from their student government.
            <br>So, while it might make for a more lively AMS assembly to talk about adding more chairs in CoGro or making an app to count the number of people using the ARC, the AMS and students would be better served by a shift in focus back to the AMS’s actual purpose.
            <br>Student apathy is often blamed for low voter turnout during the referendum, but if the AMS continues to waste students’ time and money, engagement will sink even lower — and it won’t be students’ apathy that’s at fault.
            <br>The CEO’s only responsibility is dealing with elections. Appointing someone who was ineligible to hold that position — thus compromising the integrity of the entire election — is a fairly regrettable hiring decision.
            <br>But what’s more regrettable is that the AMS didn’t come forward and explain the mistake, and their decision.
            <br>Instead, they had a closed door meeting to which none of the clubs affected by the decision were invited, then informed the clubs of their decision after the fact and told them to keep it confidential.
            <br>The decision wasn’t even publicly announced until over a week after it had been made.
            <br>The entire decision-making process lacked any transparency. The possibility of other options, such as only nullifying those results decided by a small margin, was never presented to affected students until after the decision had been made.
            <br>Nor was the questionable correlation between the CEO not paying their student fees, and therefore lacking integrity, ever explained.
            <br>Legal concerns aside, there was a more open conversation to be had here between the AMS and the student body they represent.
            <br>But instead of focusing on how this decision would impact students, the AMS unilaterally decided to let their bureaucratic blunder get in the way of student well-being.
            <br>What’s done is done, but hopefully the AMS can take a lesson from this and be more open with students in the future.

            <br>*Editor’s note: Leah Kelley, the co-chair of the Queen’s Backing Action on Climate Change, told The Journal that Jon Wiseman, the AMS commissioner of internal affairs, informed her that the CEO was ineligible because she had not paid her student fees. The AMS, however, contacted The Journal on Friday, Nov. 28 to state that while the CEO was ineligible for her position, they have not given a reason for her ineligibility. According to AMS hiring policy, the CEO also would have been ineligible for her position if she wasn't enrolled in "at least 60% of a full course load".
            <br>This article has been edited to clarify that alternative options were never presented to affected students until the decision to nullify the referendum had been made, but they were presented to AMS assembly in closed session.
            <br>The Journal regrets the error.</p>
